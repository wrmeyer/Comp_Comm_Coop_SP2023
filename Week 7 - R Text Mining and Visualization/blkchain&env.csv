Now, the price of HBAR has risen by an impressive 8% in a single day. Could this be the momentum needed to push HBAR to $1?  What is Hedera HBAR?  Hedera aims to be the blockchain of the future. While many networks exist, most are either inefficient or insecure. However, Hedera provides investors with a highly secure network that offers low fees, fast settlement time, and excellent throughput.  In addition to its merit as a transactional cryptocurrency, Hedera has smart contract functionality similar to Ethereum. This means that developers can take advantage of the network's efficiency. With so many developers looking for lower-cost solutions, the Hedera ecosystem has grown significantly since its release, likely helping to bolster the asset's price.  HBAR Price  While the asset had been in a downward trend following a strong move in July, things seemed to stabilize at $0.058 prior to an attempted breakout toward the $0.074 region. However, there was not enough momentum to sustain this breakout, leading the price of HBAR to retrace to its previous level.  Since mid-September, the price of HBAR had been hovering at around $0.058 with many investors speculating that the asset was consolidating prior to a sharp upward move. Now, it seems that move has arrived. Over the past day, HBAR jumped in value by around 8%, pushing the asset back toward $0.063.  With this level aligning with a key support region for HBAR, we could see some impressive moves coming in the near future. With that said, it's important to understand that for HBAR to retain this level, it will need a confirmed daily break above $0.062.  With HBAR trading for just above $0.50 at its peak, the asset could make for an excellent  investment. With the focus on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing increasing sharply each year, we could see HBAR fly past its previous high toward the $1 region within the next year.  While HBAR is often heralded as one of the most environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies on the market, it pales in comparison to the offerings from IMPT, a new crypto project aiming to help reduce the world's carbon emissions by tokenizing credits that equate to offsetting 1 ton of carbon. More details can be found in the .  With the project currently in its phase one presale, there's no better time to check out IMPT.

After that she became an interaction designer at IDEO’s Tokyo studio, which gave her a deep appreciation for the many and varied meanings of good design outside of the space, Ori dabbles as a food writer and has contributed stories to Gastro Obscura. Without further ado, I'm very pleased to welcome Ori to the Cryptonews Podcasts. Ori, welcome to the show.  Ori Kwan  Thanks so much for having me.  Matt Zahab  That is quite the bio there. You are a computer scientist, you are a food writer, and you love design a little bit of everything. I love to see that I'm a big foodie myself, I have to start with the topic of food. What is your go-to? What is your favorite food? And what is it like being a food writer, I feel like that is a low-key everyone's dream job.  Ori Kwan  I'm really the kind of person who wants to eat something different every day. So I don't know if I have a go-to but something that I end up eating a lot of is curry, you know, I'm actually in Japan right now, which is where I was living before the pandemic. And most people when they think of Japanese food, I think they think of you know, sushi or like Tempura or Udon that kind of thing, of course, ramen. But actually,` the number one food that Japanese young people eat and that kids eat growing up. It's actually curry here. So Japanese style curry, and there's also a whole sort of alternative movement of like spice curry is what they call it spice cut it which is really just like any curry that actually has any spice influenced often by Indian Sri Lankan cuisines, etc. And I love it. It's like really creative, you get like really Japanese stuff like, like local fish put in the curry and stuff like that. And it's just like super fun. So yeah, being a food writer, I don't know if I've I really haven't done much lately, and I've been pretty busy with the whole crypto thing. But it was a really fun kind of like side hustle to try being a food writer. And I think it's really rewarding. So I would recommend that to anyone who's interested because all you need to do is just like pitch them articles. And if one of the editors likes your idea, you're off to the races.  Matt Zahab  So interesting there. The curry take I've never heard of that before. And like Japanese culture is so, it has such a lens on it. You know, like every not every other but so many other cultures really look up to Japanese culture, whether it's food, or whatever. But the curry thing that just that's bananas to me like I've never heard of that.  Ori Kwan  Yeah, people just don't know, because Japanese curry is really not that popular abroad. Unless you're part of probably like the Asian community. I guess it's something that we just kind of know about. But there's not a lot of like Japanese curry restaurants in the States, for example. And so that's something that I encourage you to try out because I think it is really great. It's very unique. It's actually more inspired by the British curries, I was brought over when the British Navy first visited Japan. And so that's where it has no spice whatsoever. But it's still curry.  Matt Zahab  That's so cool. Let's jump right into design. I'm a huge fan of incredible design, shout out to your website, I'm sure you had some influence on that. It is just about as beautiful, simple and sexy as it gets the little jellyfish in the background, the little fish. He's the sort of bottom of the ocean, the blues, the yellows. It's so bloody clean. I absolutely love that I love going on a website, or using an application or a mobile app. And it just makes you feel good. How can the average Joe or Josephine sort of steal and learn from literal experts like you like what do you guys do? Are there other any bits of low-hanging fruit that people like me could take from this because this is such an important part of life. 99% of everything we use is just terrible from a design perspective, and then there's the oddballs and outliers like this, what can we do to learn some  Ori Kwan  Actually, talk to people I would say is the key like show people your design how people use it and watch how they end interact with it. And that really is the core principle of human-centered design, which is what we practice at IDEO, what we practiced at Stanford's design school. And it really is not rocket science, it means that when you're starting with your design your project, it's not. Okay, what do I think would look good on this page? What do I think my users would like? It's actually going and talking to those users understanding what they react well to understanding what their actual needs are, and then designing a solution to that problem. I think good design can come in many, many forms, like I mentioned earlier in my bio, but I think one that's really underrated, it's actually about user experience design. I think it's wonderful if a site is beautiful, and I really am grateful to the talented illustrators who helped make Orca’s site beautiful. But what's even more important, I think, is that it's very simple to use. And that really just comes from continued testing continued practice and intuition. And anyone who wants to learn it, I'd say, just look up human centered design. And there's tons of free resources available on the internet.  Matt Zahab  Is that where you would say to start? That's the best place?  Ori Kwan  I would say so. So honestly, like I know, IDEO, which is the design firm that I used to work at has like free toolkits online for starting to learn about human-centered design. There's sort of this repeatable process that we use for all of the projects back when I was a consultant at IDEO. And it really always starts with the same thing like need-finding, talking to people. And then you do some synthesis, like, what are the things we learned from those people? And then we do some idea generation, like, what types of things could we build that actually solve those needs? Then you narrow down to a solution, et cetera, et cetera. And so it really is this repeatable process. And, you know, starting my career at Coursera, as well, I know that there's so much high-quality free education out there. So if you're serious about practicing design, that's a whole discipline that you can just learn just like engineering.  Matt Zahab  Well said, Yeah, Coursera is absolutely brilliant. There's so many. So many of these just sort of free course platforms out there. Heck, you can get, you know, an E Online Harvard degree, right, like it's and where you went Sanford as well. Absolutely insane. Bananas. You are a programmer, designer, Illustrator and the co-founder of Orca with such a design-oriented background. What made you get into crypto like that? You don't I mean, that doesn't? Yes, there's such a need for the two to be intertwined, but it's not a traditional career path into the cryptocurrency space.  Ori Kwan  Yeah, it's totally true. I was chatting with my co-founder the other day, and we're like, what would ourselves three years ago, which is just before we started working on Orca, have thought seeing ourselves today? And my thought was like, I think Oreo three years ago would be like crypto No, no way. Because I was definitely not one of those people who's been following since like, 2014, I really kind of fell down the rabbit hole. Because I was pulled, so to speak, I think a lot of people are pulled. And that really was by meeting my co-founder, here in Tokyo, I was actually living in Tokyo at the time and had just moved into a new place. And across the hall was my co-founder. He just happened to live there already. And he had been working and been interested in crypto for a long time. At the time, he was actually contributed to the Ethereum Foundation. And it just so happened that that was around the time when like COVID was getting really intense. We all got locked in, in Tokyo. And so you know, it was kind of actually really fun, at first, like being locked in with your friends. But after some period of time, we just started getting bored, and like hacking on some projects together. And one thing led to another. And finally, we had this crypto startup. So sometimes life just kind of like takes you by surprise.  Matt Zahab  It's crazy. And I assume that's the best of both worlds. Obviously, as part of the Ethereum Foundation, he had and has quite a sort of technical background, and you come in with the design and you know, artsy side. And that's really what exactly what you want. That's how you get that match right now.  Ori Kwan  Yeah, I think we got really lucky. Like, I think our conversation was pretty much like, Hey, I'm an engineer and a designer, you're an engineer, like I probably favor that front end, and you probably favorite, the back end. Like there's a lot we could build together with just the two of us. I've always actually identified as like a jack of all trades, and never had really a strong leaning towards any particular one thing growing up, which made me I think, feel very mediocre. And a society that really rewards and celebrates people who are very, extremely good at one thing. But I've realized that often it's like folks like myself who are willing to wear like any hat and actually kind of enjoy wearing any hat that can make a startup happen because you really do need people who can juggle all these different roles when you only have like two or three people on a team.  Matt Zahab  So well that there are society rewarding specialists over generalists, that's very true. It's no different than other aspects of life cooking, right? The best chefs in the world usually specialize in a couple of different things and boom, they're off to the races. Athletes do the best and the best is zero point. 00 1% in your sport, that's why you're getting paid 10 to 50 mil a year. It's crazy. It's very, very true. Most of us, myself included generalist for the most part, but you really want to get out there and make a name for yourself. God become a specialist. Well said already well said. Let's talk about Orca. Give me the elevator pitch. Give me the 32-second. What do you and the team do? And I can't wait to get into some of the cylinder base stuff. But let's start with the Orca elevator pitch.  Ori Kwan  For sure. So Orca is the leading crypto marketplace on Solana. By leading, I say we're actually leaving in terms of trading volume, which is what we believe is the key metric that you should look at when it comes to measuring a crypto marketplace. I think when it comes to discussions of crypto if everyone's like TBL, TBL TBL. But if you're looking at a marketplace, I think what really matters is how much people are trading. So there's that. And Orca is known for a couple of different things. I think one is the focus on human-centered design that you've mentioned so far. I think that goes beyond just how people are interacting with the interface and into really everything that Orca does. From the Climate Fund that we'll talk about, I believe a little bit later, to being extremely developer friendly. So a lot of Orca’s efforts lately have gone into building the best possible development experience for builders who are extending Orca for all sorts of applications from you know, these liquidity aggregators, to trade aggregators, to vaults and games, etc. And so, say Orca, at its core is really a concentrated liquidity, AMM, that is designed to take away all the complexity that goes into being in concentrated liquidity AMM. And just provide a really simple trading interface for everyone.  Matt Zahab  You talked about the importance of developers, this seems like a very straightforward point. And it is, the more devs you have building on your platform, the wider you become, the more powerful you become. It's how you onboard the next billion users, which is the thing we're all trying to do. The thing that interests me the most. And my question for you, Ori, how do you incentivize developers to come on your platform, the easiest is always the money aspect, right bounties here, Grant here, big floats or incentive programs, but money financial incentives side, how do you get devs to build on your platform?  Ori Kwan  You have to make it easy for them. Like this is something that I deeply understand having been a dev for actually, like the longest stretch of my career was as a dev, right. And as a dev, really what you're doing is not writing code from scratch, I think people who, you know, see the those like, movies of like programmers kind of like judges, and they're just like writing tons and tons of code. Like, that's not really the reality, right? Like, what we're doing is actually taking these Legos and web2 actually has like an even bigger library of Legos and web3, and people are just like composing these Legos. And really, usually what you're doing is like building a ton of these Legos, and then you write like a, like one new Lego on top. And so like, what you got to do is make your Lego extremely easy to use, right? And that's what we've done through a super, super simple SDK. And also through having this staff of really incredible developer advocates who just shout out to Yeti and you good air current to amazing developer advocates who are there to answer developers questions every step of the way. Because nothing is more frustrating than just like getting an error no matter what you're doing, whether you're coding or like trying to buy a plane ticket, and then you go to the Help button. And then it just like gets you down some kind of automated phone support rabbit hole, right? Like you want to talk to an actual person. And so I think those are the two ways that are different.  Matt Zahab  And the second one, sorry, you touched on the second one, the summation of that was customer support kind of thing.  Ori Kwan  Yeah, so developer support. And first of all, is like, you know, the ideal situation is that it just works. And now in the majority of time, I think Orca’s SDK is designed to be super simple, so that anyone can really just use it without much effort. Everything is open source. The Whirlpool smart contract is open source. And the SDK itself is open source. So developers can also really like look at the guts, but if they have questions, there's also like real people they can talk to and Orca’s discord.  Matt Zahab  Gotcha. Interesting. See, as someone who does not code that would be so freakin awesome. And that's like when I have problems that are not even remotely as complex as ones that your devs are working on I also like, no shit, I don't know why I'm having this aha moment right now. It's so friend of mine. It's so simple, but this is huge. Very good point. There. Very, very good point. Wow, can you just put my head in a blender there? I can't believe more. Why don't more people do this? It seems like there's really not that much overhead. Either right, having one or two senior devs who can answer questions in a quick and remote fashion or creating again, just like what you guys have some type of developer discord where the community almost manages itself like Is this really that hard to implement?  Ori Kwan  Well,it is. And it isn't. I mean, I think it is hard and that finding devs is hard. And then every dev who you have that's focused on, like answering other people's questions, well, those are hours of the day that could go into core development, right. And so it's a hard trade-off. And also, not every dev really enjoys, like answering questions, right, there's like a certain personality type, I think. And that personality type is usually like the kind of person who gets a lot of joy out of helping other people, which is just really lovely to see. But I think I probably know more devs who get joy out of like the art of creation, which is the other thing that they should be spending time on, and many do both as well, right. And also, I should also say that many other projects do have developer support. And many of the most successful ones do you know, many companies are built on top of good customer service and Dev experience is really just one of those versions. So that's why when I talk about user experience, I think of users in many different forms. You know, Orca has a couple audiences. There are the traders there, the market makers, and then there is these builders, and all of them are users and all of them deserve a good experience.  Matt Zahab  Love that. Let's jump into Orca’s initiative with climate. Now. I know this hits very close to home with you. It is very front and center with a lot of your company ethos, your company narrative, you guys do an incredible job of really pushing this out to the public, for great reasons. Climate footprint is a massive issue present day and Orca is doing a hell of a lot to not just sort of manage that, but measure it as well. The one thing that I couldn't find on my show notes, and this is definitely on me and not your team. But you guys talk a lot about your climate footprint and how you are measuring that. How do you measure that? How do you measure the climate footprint of you know, your output?  Ori Kwan  It's a really hard question, because it really depends on what you determine is as yours or ours. Right. I think there's a couple of different scopes. And this is something that we've only recently started to look at on the Orca Climate Fund, which I'm a contributor to so Orca directs like a portion of all of its trading volume to the Orca Climate Fund, which has historically, and my original idea was to use it all for philanthropy. But more and more recently started to move towards Orca actually doing its own proactive initiatives like the carbon accounting, unlike the article that I published recently, and welcome anyone who's interested in this topic to read, because that really chronicles the deep dive that I did, along with other Orca Climate Fund contributors to zoom in and Andy, into really everything that could be considered part of the footprint. And so I would say long story short, one, the simplest way of thinking about it, and the way that I felt was most important to start was really just by looking at the energy consumption of the protocol itself. And the protocol itself is a much smaller scope, really just like the smart contracts, the SDKs. And then ultimately, like the validators and RPC nodes that are powering the transactions that Orca runs on. And so, you know, what we discovered is actually that, compared to, you know, the everyone always loves to talk about, like how proof of work is destroying the world. And you know, it does use a lot of energy. But Solana is like already incredibly energy efficient, right? I think just like, it's actually so efficient, that almost like trying to reduce the energy consumption of the Solana protocols is not necessarily the most effective way to approach the problem. And just like one example of that, is just based on the accounting that I've done, like on average, it looks like roughly like a round trip flight from somewhere like New York, to Lisbon, which is where the Solana conference will be is like 1.5 metric tons of carbon emitted. And the entire Solana network only takes something around, I think it was like 3000 metric tons of carbon for 2021. So the Solana breakpoint conference this year has 5000 Tickets available. So if there are 5000 tickets, on average, takes like one metric ton of carbon to fly there, then the conference is generating more than the entire network. And so you know, what we've done looking at the Orca Climate Fund is to commit to either buying tokenized offsets for the actual like RPC nodes that Orca rounds, which are the servers that actually serve Orcas requests to the blockchain. And that's one thing, but then another is to actually just offset all of the flights that the team contributors are purchasing to break point because ultimately, I think we want to put things in perspective a little bit like yes, it's important to take responsibility for what energy the protocol creates, but like, what's the actual bigger impact here and it's probably off chain activities.  Matt Zahab  That's crazy that you have that outlook, it's absolute cash. I friggin love that. Again, I'm just looking at my notes and it's like, so often companies will do what they think is the right thing, right? What sort of the public wants to hear, but like, you just look me dead ass in the eye. And we're like, look, we're, I'm telling you right now, we can make a better change. And we can do more for climate by showing that, hey, the flights we take is a hell of a lot more no bueno than using Solana as a whole. And therefore we are going to offset this via Orcas climate. Yeah, this is this is I absolutely love this. This is, this is great. Or you should be helping a lot more web3 leaders in this. How could you do that? If you were running a crypto backed sort of Climate Initiative? What would your protocols be? What would your rules and regs be? What would sort of your you know, your top five or whatever big points? What would you attack right off the bat? What's the lowest hanging fruit?  Ori Kwan  I think the lowest hanging fruit really is starting to look at like energy reduction and offsets. So asking your validators or you're like the RPC node providers that you work with, for example, to move towards more renewable energy if available. I think, you know, offsets are very contentious. And there we've also written a lot about this in the article. So I think doing your own research, or if you choose to purchase offsets and making sure that you're purchasing high quality offsets that are actually nature based and contributing to the long term health of the planet, is another one. But I would say the ultimate principle to abide by is exactly what you said. It's not about what looks good. Because philanthropy for the third purpose of looking good is very common. Greenwashing is a term that's used a lot here, but really more thinking about what is the actual impact of the actions. And that's something that you know, I think, even I felt a little bit guilty of when to sin, who is another the OCF contributor who has a sustainability background was saying, like, hey, it's really, really great that we're doing these donations, it's meaningful, but what can we actually do that's more like Orca native, that's more web three climate native. And, you know, it's not ultimately up to me to make all the decisions and because it is a decentralized protocol, and I'm, at the end of the day, actually just a contributor. But I do think it's very meaningful for founders to come out and say that this is important. And so Orcas two missions are one to create more financial opportunity through equal access to markets, but second to also have a positive impact on our climate. And I think enshrining that at the Mission level of the company is like the most important thing that a founder can do.  Matt Zahab  Why did you feel the need to enshrine that at the core level of the company? Because again, at the end of the day, you guys are your Solana based defi ecosystem, right? Like the climate isn't primary, it very well could be secondary. And again, I'm nitpicking here, but why do you feel that it's such an important topic that it is the second most important part of your ethos.  Ori Kwan  Everyone needs to take responsibility for climate like it or not? Right? And this is something that yeah, I don't have the deepest climate background, but it's just become very obvious to me that this is the biggest threat facing our planet today. And it's irresponsible, I think for someone who has as much influence and power as like a company founder to not care about this at all. And when we started Orca, like, to be honest, yeah, I'm very dubious about the ultimate like impact of crypto on the world right now, I don't think crypto is necessarily like a net positive or negative, right? There's a lot of different lenses through which you can view good or bad. But one thing that I felt was strictly a good thing and it was important for us to do was to make an impact on something that was kind of like undeniably good, in my opinion that that's climate.  Matt Zahab  I love that well said extremely well said alright, let's jump into Solana a little more GameFi-ish. Right. Solana GameFi is absolutely popping off at the moment. There are tons of new games being built. One of my favorite parts is the play to earn movement is sort of almost gone now, which I absolutely love to see. Use the power of the blockchain to let gamers and users own their in-game assets and play and maybe earn not play to earn earnings should not be the primary ethos. The primary ethos is having fun and rewarding the attention economy and if you want to own your in-game assets, great. You can do that for you the blockchain more specifically, we know where to Solana GameFi I know Orcas doing a lot of work there. How will Orca power the Solana game fight ecosystem?  Ori Kwan  Building a game is hard, like crazy hard. Yeah, I'm a lifelong gamer. I grew up I remember like five years old. My dad took me to a secondhand game shop and he was like, Pick anything you want. And like I just picked Kirby's Dreamland and it really all just started there. I'm proud of my five year olds choice like Sal for making that choice out of probably all the really crap games that were available there.  Matt Zahab  That's a vet move.  Ori Kwan  Yeah, very proud. Looking back. Um, but yeah, like looking forward. You know, as a dev and someone who loves games, I had always thought about building a game, and I've dabbled a little bit like You know, not much. But when I was at Coursera, I took their game developer specialization, I dabbled a bit in unity and made like some really simple platformers. And like, man, it is so hard to build a game like, it's actually incredible that games run as well as they do. And like, you know, a lot of the time we can't even get basic web apps to work, right? So I think what Orca is really offering is that Lego, because now games have to worry about not only all of the existing things around frame rates, and bugs, and blah, blah, blah, but also bootstrapping a functioning token economy. And that's clearly something that entire companies and protocols are built around. So it's kind of unrealistic to expect them to spin it up themselves and just add that to their workload. So in this, what we're really aiming to be is that truly simple, truly easy to use, DeFi Lego. And we found that like games really appreciate having someone who understands that point of view as well as like having that dedicated support to help them bridge over from web2 to web3.  Matt Zahab  DeFi Lego? Can you keep going on that term? For me? I feel like you have a hell of a lot more. On that term. I feel like there's a bunch of gold nuggets just chilling up there. Keep going on that.  Ori Kwan  I love it. Yeah, I guess DeFi Lego, maybe that was like a hotter term, even two years ago. Now everyone's like web3 and NFTs. But it really is like the promise of being able to build anything that has to do with like finance or financial tools in web3, using all these existing building blocks. So Lego really just speaks to building blocks, right. And as I mentioned, most folks building in web2 are also using these Legos, right? If you go on to NPM, there's just an amazing, incredible resource of open source tools that people have put out there. I think the most beautiful thing about like the internet, is that openness, right? Like the fact that there are so much information, so many tools that you can just go out there and use right like, I can't even imagine front end development without react. And you know, as soon as people have different opinions about Facebook, but I think the best and like most clearly good thing that Facebook has ever done is open source, the React library, because it just made building so much better. And that's what we want to do with like Orca is just put out these tools that people can use to build things that honestly like we couldn't even dream of. And really, it's like building anything that requires a market. And like markets, you know, people have lots of negative views on finance in general, but everyone wants like financial opportunity, right? And financial opportunity is created when people have the actual assets or value to like be able to take risks, right I think it feels very abstract as I'm talking about this, but let's say like, you know, back in the day, some explorer wanted to go on a voyage you know, they need assets, they need a ship, they need all these like you know actual goods to power the voyage and you need someone to actually transfer those assets. And this is like a very abstract version of that in the future where people can build anything that allows people to transfer these assets to fund these different opportunities  Matt Zahab  Great analogy! Folks we are gonna take a quick break and when we come back Ori is going to keep dropping knowledge bombs got a huge shout out to our sponsor the show that is PrimeXBT you guys know I love PrimeXBT as I've been using them for a hot minute now. Why do I love them because they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders doesn't matter if you're a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. The promo code is CRYPTONEWS50 and that gives you 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account only for listeners of the Cryptonews pod that is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And I'm back to the show with Ori. Alright, let's keep buzzing on Solana for a little bit. I know this is very cliche. But whenever I have an industry leader who specializes within the salon ecosystem, I always learn something new that I didn't know before. And I'm going to ask the same question to you. Tell me about a couple of the benefits of building on Solana.  Ori Kwan  Solana’s is team is ridiculously good. And they are ridiculously good developers. One thing that I think differentiates Solana from other chains is that their team really understands what it means to build an extremely difficult to operate network at this very high scale. And yes, that sometimes means that there are troubles, you know, early on when you're actually fielding like a ton of network requests. And we've seen like Solana go down. But I think the recovery has actually been very, fairly elegant. And folks in the ecosystem are very supportive and very mature. And they all really believe in building this decentralized ecosystem that is fast enough and has low enough fees to actually scale to support any kind of application. Right and just from talking to Anatoly to Raj and to the team, I think, like you can tell that they really believe in this vision and they're not just like theoretical researchers. You know, I think a lot of chains it's like, oh, really cool theoretical consensus mechanism, but ultimately, like, can they scale to serve all of these different users? So it's kind of like the jury's out but we fit on Solana.  Matt Zahab  Do you guys have access to the team? Like is it like literally, you know, signal or telegram quickness kind of thing, fire off a message, they get back to you ASAP.  Ori Kwan  I mean, I do, which is pretty great. But that's like human relationships, right? Like, I think we've met these folks. We've been around since the beginning, like we hung out at break point. And I'm a nomad. So I've kind of just tried to hang out with folks wherever I go. And so I was like, doing a 24 hour layover in Chicago the other day, and Solana has an office there. So I just like spun by grab coffee, and just try to focus on the fact that, you know, we're all humans just kind of grinding. Like, it sounds glamorous. But you know, we're all tired, where we all can like empathize and the challenges we face. And like having those connections on a human level is so meaningful.  Matt Zahab  That's so cool. And the classic question, which everyone always wants to know. Did you ever think about ETH. Did you ever know polygon wouldn't have worked for what you guys are doing, but was there ever another option? Another protocol in which you decided to build on or was it just like salon from the get go, we're gonna do this and we're gonna run with it.  Ori Kwan  Well, before we actually built Orca on Solana, my co founder Yutaro. And I actually did build a little application on Ethereum. It was called Wallaroo, it was supposed to be like a high interest savings app type thing on Ethereum. And, you know, when we started Yutaro, was actually a contributor at the Ethereum foundation. So we're definitely not chain maxis. I think it was really just the starting from user experience, right? Like, it doesn't make sense. And it's not a good experience for users who want to like, do like a high interest savings app type experience, when gas fees are like $50. And so it's like, how can we develop the experience that we want for users? Looked around? Yeah, Solana basically caught Yutaro eye back when SPF and FTX were actually investing in ecosystem as well. And just like, did some due diligence or like, mind blown like this. There's actually like a non sharded L one that can provide this type of like TPS and these incredibly low fees? Well, you know, the All that sounds like ridiculous, like SpaceX jargon to anyone who's not already, like pretty deep in the technical side of crypto. But what does it really mean? It means that you can build credibly simple and elegant experiences. And that's what matters.  Matt Zahab  Well said, building incredibly simple and elegant experiences. Wow. very articulate. Craziness. craziness. Craziness. Ori, this has been an absolute treat. I do know we're getting a little bit tight for time here. Let's keep going on Solana, what are the next couple months look like for the Solana ecosystem? I know there's a lot of big things planned. I know there's a lot of big things planned for Orca as well. What do we as consumers? What can we look forward to?  Ori Kwan  That's a bear market, which also means that it's a builder's market, I think a lot of folks echo my feeling that it's just less distractions, right. And so what Orca is focused on right now is making that best possible Lego and making improvements to it. So one project that I'm really excited for that's kicking off is what we call the smart router, which is actually being able to route trades across multiple concentrated liquidity pools to provide better execution. Again, this is like at its core, one of those really complicated algorithms problems that ultimately translates to a much more elegant and simple experience for the end user. better prices, right? That's what every trader wants. And so they think it's these type of fundamental improvements that whereas actually might not even be that understandable to people on the outside actually prepares these Legos for like primetime use.  Matt Zahab  So on the back end, crypto nerd explanation that would be being able to route trades across multiple complex liquidity pools, but on sort of the front end, not so nerdy, just you know, consumer facing more singular goal oriented, it would be cheaper trades, better prices.  Ori Kwan  Exactly. Yeah. So there's like technical improvements, which lead to better user experiences. And I think on the Solana side, as well as the protocol side, like also something Orca is doing is really investing in these like BD and these partnerships. I'm really excited for some of the upcoming game launches, really excited for some of the other kind of more retail focused partnerships that Solana side that I can't speak to, but I think I've definitely seen, you know, conversations flying around. And so I think what I see right now, as is laying the foundations, making sure that when we actually do, hopefully have like a super lively bull market ahead in the future, those applications are actually delivering real value to people.  Matt Zahab  You continuously bring up the importance of user experience, it seems like, again, I'm putting words in your mouth, my apologies in advance here, but it seems like when you're building Orca, or when you built things in the past, that's like literally the forefront of everything. Do I have any grounds to say that and if that's the case, I'm just like, I'm thinking and I'm trying to look back at some of the things I've built and I'm just like, why haven't I prioritized user experience more than that that just makes so much sense. It's so bloody front of mind and simple, but no one does it. Is that true with you?  Ori Kwan  What I care about is creating value, right? I'm a builder at heart, I actually remember when I was like, you know, 12. And we had talked about how, you know, they're kind of a jack of all trades, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. But I remember a piece of advice that my dad gave me at the time is try to focus on actually creating value and not just moving value around. Like, he's an engineer as well. So I think that's kind of like, where, where that spirit comes from. But I think you can't really create value, if no one is taking advantage of the things that you've created. So no matter how cool the thing is, if no one's using it, it's not creating value. And that's where user experience comes into play. Right? And I think you asked for a hot take earlier, so I'll just preempt you with a hot take, I think like very little in the entire NFT community is creating any value. I'm just like, I thought NFTs are really cool back in like 2019 when nobody was paying attention to NFTs I was like, but what kind of utility can they have? Like, what can these things power and so far, I think mostly what NFTs are, are these like exclusive boys clubs that are concentrating wealth in the hands of the already wealthy, because access to these NFTs gives you access to information that other people don't have, which you can use to like speculate on more NFTs. It's mostly just like all speculation. So personally, I'm very disappointed in what kind of exists out there. But I also at the same time, I'm very excited and hopeful for what NFTs, can power in the future. I think there's a ton of potential in the idea of these digital representations that can evolve over time, you know, based on like, metadata or based on just pure ownership. I think what's interesting about blockchains is like radical transparency, and also this like radically verifiable ownership. And there's tons of things that can be built on top of that, but we're just not there yet. And so, you know, crypto is a very money driven space speculation is bound to happen. But what I'm waiting for is the things that are happening after all of that kind of settles down a little bit.  Matt Zahab  Or you can't just stop there, you got to keep passing on that subject. Give me Give me some good give me some good NFT use cases. No, you got a hell of a lot more up there. You can't leave behind dry like that.  Ori Kwan  Well, I think the most imminent ones I really on in games, right. And I think that's why people are allowed to be very creative, because ultimately, the value that's created is entertainment. And I don't think I need to be like super stodgy and say like, all value has to be like, you know, lifting people out of poverty. Amazing. But I think entertainment is a value in itself as well. And that's where we're starting to see things like you know, even like composed NFTs one of the projects that we were talking about, was talking about NFTs that own and other NFTs. So I'll just like give an example is maybe, you know, I was like a NEO pets girl growing up, me too. You have these pets? Yeah, but those pets can own other pets. And then those pets can have like different equipment, right. And all of that stuff is can be expressed through NFTs. So that's kind of like one way of actually making these things like pretty interesting, right is like you can actually transfer that representation very simply and easily so that you actually can, you know, give someone else this this pet that you've invested in. But that's like a pretty well understood one, you know, this is purely just like my dreaming in my mind. But something that I experienced recently when I was actually in Mexico City for the first time, which shout out to Mexico City is probably now my other city favorite city in the world besides Tokyo. But it's so popular that when I went I was immediately Yeah, it's incredible. It's like super leafy super green, amazing climate cute dogs everywhere, amazing food friendly. People love it. And like a lot of other people love it and the Nomad community. So I was immediately hit with these, like eight different guides to Mexico City that different friends or friends of friends had created. And they were all in different formats, and all like, incompatible, right? So I ended up pretty much just kind of like, going back to my roots. And I just use the one that I thought was the nicest format, because that nice formatting means user experience, right? And all these other ones, like, they're just like, gone, you know, like, people put all these effort into these things, but like, unless I'm probably just gonna, like end up losing it in my email, right. And so one thing that I thought could be pretty interesting is actually to like have these different types of guides actually be NFTs in some kind of like, more standard format. So maybe you could see like, all of these different recommendations on a map and they could all be annotated, like this one's from Matt, and this one's from Ori This one's you know, has all the information like people's actual recommendations built in this kind of like very web2-type experience, I think that it still provides value in different ways. Maybe it's not like something as epic as like billions of dollars of trade volume, but like they're totally valid use cases that I think NFTs and like web three can be integrated into you in a way that's meaningful, just that it's perhaps the financial incentives aren't there yet.  Matt Zahab  Interesting. That's a great take there. I gotta ask a follow up, but Mexico City, I've never been on the bucketlist. At least the danger, I always hear crazy stories about the danger, is that still present that you need to know where to go or not to go? What's that like?  Ori Kwan  So there are definitely parts of Mexico that are very dangerous. I've never been outside of Mexico City. And you know, again, this is speaking to what I've generally heard. But to be honest, I felt like incredibly safe the entire time I was there, I was traveling as a solo female. But there's like a very, very strong expat community in Mexico City. And there's certain neighborhoods that I think are just really lovely. They're just like, filled with both expats and actually a lot of locals, I think as well. You know, it's super affordable for someone who's lucky enough to come from America at least to like, take Ubers everywhere. Public transit is like a flat five pesos, which is like 25 cents. I just so easy to get around. And the fact that I couldn't, you know, Uber home after, like, a night out with friends meant that I actually didn't feel very safe. And so, you know, personally, I these days, I feel pretty unsafe in New York, like, yeah, that's like a whole another topic, but I think everything's relative, right?  Matt Zahab  Yeah. 100% Yeah. New York's the homelessness there. And just the shootings and stabbings it's out of control. It's bananas.  Ori Kwan  Yeah, the world is a crazy place. I mean, if you weren't really safe come to Tokyo. Like this is definitely the safest place I've ever gotten to the point where you know, you get a little lax if you spent too much time here. I'm like, Yeah, I can just like leave my laptop open on a cafe table and no one's gonna take it right. That's just how things are.  Matt Zahab  That's crazy. You must have been to Dubai right?  Ori Kwan  I haven't actually, no.  Matt Zahab  The reason why I asked is because that's the safest I've ever felt I you know, swim in the ocean you laptop phone, wallet wide open on a beach chair. Not a worry in the world would didn't even look back at it. Whereas I don't think I genuinely don't think I've ever been anywhere else on the planet where I would do that. Even in my own country in Canada. I wouldn't, Toronto, I would never dream after that my phone would be gone at t minus two minutes like crazy. But then again, if you steal there, like your risk cut off. So different strokes for different folks, right?  Ori Kwan  Yeah, well, definitely a place I hope to visit. I do hope to keep my risk because those are pretty important for development. I've heard a lot. But yeah, you know, there's trade offs for wherever you go. That's something I've gotten a lot of appreciation for. And just like my Nomad time, you have to appreciate that. Also, you're a visitor in these countries. So like, what I'm speaking to is really like my small expat slice of a view on Mexico City and can be very different than a locals view. But one thing that I did feel is just a lot of love for the country from both like locals and expats and being there on the Mexican Independence Day. I think I felt that more strongly than any other time. So definitely recommend.  Matt Zahab  I feel like you and I could buzz about travel forever. One more question, then we'll wrap up or what's the most underrated city you've ever been to?  Ori Kwan  Underrated? Ooh. Yeah, I feel like my favorites might be kind of mainstream. I think out of the places that I've been. The ones I've really loved are I mean, of course, Tokyo and Florence and Istanbul and Mexico City. I mean, in some ways MEXICO CITY I feel like it's still relatively undiscovered. But maybe I'll put a shout out for like, the more we call it Inaka. But like countryside regions of Japan, there are a lot of areas of Japan that are really just like not very traveled to everyone goes to like Tokyo, Kyoto, but I personally love the southern regions of Japan like Kyushu. Shikoku. Like Fukuoka is an incredibly well developed city that's actually like very easy to live out of like it's super affordable. It's beautiful. There's like a nice river that runs through. And for people who are actually local to Japan, they know that it has some of like the most incredible nature like hiking, scuba diving, surfing, like really whatever you want, and like and is incredible food or like really unique food and that the Americans probably love most is ramen. And that like really sort of like fatty, rich style of poem klutzy ramen originates in Fukuoka, at least in Kyushu. And so that's where you should go to get like the real stuff. I'll cost you like $3  Matt Zahab  How many languages do you speak by the way?  Ori Kwan  I speak three conversationally I would say like Chinese Japanese and English and then I speak like Spanish and Italian well enough to like get by and you know, survive.  Matt Zahab  Interesting because yeah, the Japanese accent was very on there like see Yeah, effortless. All right, this has been incredible. Thank you so much. I have learned just an absolute shit ton pardon my French but I've learned yet to put that on your list of languages to learn. I've learned so much from you very grateful that you came on the show. This will be one that I will definitely be listening to on a walk. I hate hearing my own voice. But it will be nice listening to all of the knowledge bombs that you dropped. As a marketer myself, I have so much to learn about the fundamentals of design, user experiences you In finding, talking to people talking to users finding the solution to problems, this was a nice fire that was lighted or has been lit under my derriere. So thank you for that. Really appreciate it. And I definitely would love to have you on for round two. Until then, now, I wish you in the team all the best and before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Orca online and on socials?  Ori Kwan  Of course. Thank you so much, man. Yeah, I've done a fair number of podcasts. This is one of the most fun for sure. You can find Orca on Twitter. It is at twitter.com/orca_so we are Orca_so on all channels so you can find links to discord telegram etc there and I'm also on Twitter as well usually tweeting really long tweet thread that I hope someone will eventually read. I am @oritheorca.  Matt Zahab  Alright, Ori, thank you so much for the treats really appreciate it and can't wait to have you on to the next one.  Ori Kwan  Thanks so much Matt. Have a good one.  Matt Zahab  Folks, what an incredible episode with Ori from Orca dropping absolute knowledge bombs left right and center we absolutely love to see it I know you guys will love this one. As always everything Orca related and Ori related will be in the show notes and this will be a long shownotes as well as there were tons of bombs dropped. Folks if you love this and I really hope you did please do subscribe it would mean the world to my team and I speaking of the team love you guys until the listeners you are all the GOATs keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now, and we will talk soon. All the best."
"3",781,2022-10-11,"CryptoDaily","Moshnake (MSH), Ethereum (ETH), and Ellipsis (EPS) are some of the best cryptocurrencies with the potential to help their holders survive the current crypto winter.  This article discusses what makes these cryptos worth holding and why they could be your best buy-ins, considering the condition of the market.  Moshnake: The Hot New Gaming Cryptocurrency  The GameFi community grew bigger with the introduction of NFT gaming and the Metaverse. Moshnake (MSH) breaks in as a new cryptocurrency gaming platform that is community-focused. The gaming platform also appeals to lovers of the classic Snake Xenzia game, with an incorporation of the play-to-earn (P2E) model.  Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Moshnake (MSH) is built for all age groups—with everyone having access to play the game and connect with other players at any given time while earning. The game boasts a user-friendly interface and promotes competitiveness among players in its battle royale arena.  The Moshnake (MSH) token is the governance token of the community, with holders enjoying voting rights on important decisions concerning the project. Players also earn Venom tokens (VEN) as the in-game currency. Both of these are BEP-20 tokens expected to be valuable and interoperable across blockchain networks.  In addition, users will enjoy additional incentives, such as Moshnake (MSH) airdrops and listing in major exchanges for more accessibility.  Ethereum: The Smart Contract Cryptocurrency  Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain for developing dApps, DAOs, and NFTs through smart contracts. It is the second most used and generally accepted cryptocurrency in the world. The network is built on the innovations of Bitcoin (BTC) to revolutionize traditional institutions, especially financial institutions.  The Ethereum blockchain is a hub for financial services, games, social networks, and apps with privacy preservation. Furthermore, the network is programmable, which is one of its greatest advantages over the Bitcoin network. This is because it allows for apps to be built that will utilize blockchain technology to store data and control their functionality.  Ethereum has Ether (ETH) as its native token. Ethereum users use Ether (ETH) to process and pay for transactions, gas fees on the network, and smart contracts.  Ether tokens (ETH) were formerly created through crypto mining. However, the network recently transitioned from its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, eliminating mining. This transition aims to improve security, sustainability, and scalability while lessening the transaction fees on the Ethereum (ETH) network.  Ethereum (ETH) has proven to be a great buy for its users and shows no sign of slowing down. The value of Ether (ETH) rises based on its service as a transactional currency, a digital store of value for some users, a means of collateral for facilitating loans, and an investment for other crypto users.  Ellipsis: The DeFi Cryptocurrency  Ellipsis (EPS) is a crypto platform that acts as an automated market maker (AMM) to allow users and other decentralized platforms to trade various stablecoins with low spillage and minimal fees in the cryptocurrency market. The platform replaces the traditional market maker by making use of liquidity pools.  The EPS token serves as the native token of the platform. The major functions of the EPS token are to incentivize liquidity providers on the Ellipsis platform and allow users to participate in the distribution of incentives. Also, token holders provide liquidity and can earn staking rewards which they can withdraw or ‘restake’ to make more from the liquidity pool.  The platform plans to migrate its EPS tokens to EPX tokens — to increase the relative supply from 1 billion to 1.5 billion and its absolute total token supply to 132 billion tokens, an increment of about 88 times more.  As a fork of Curve Finance, hosted on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ellipsis (EPS) better suits individuals seeking ways to swap their tokens or earn as liquidity providers. Conversely, Ellipsis (EPS) aims to offer efficient and well-priced swaps, an environmentally friendly yield to token holders, and a solution to building deep liquidity.  Through various offerings and incentives like token airdrops, cheaper transaction fees, and liquidity rewards, Moshnake (MSH), Ethereum (ETH), and Ellipsis (EPS) aim to reward token holders while increasing their market value in the cryptocurrency market.

"4",476,2022-10-11,"CryptoDaily","Due to the recent collapse of the cryptocurrency market, Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) may have recently seen large gains. For example, Cardano (ADA) could achieve a price hike of around 5% within a period of 24 hours.  But Flasko seems to dominate the presale, surpassing both currencies. All cryptocurrency aficionados should be aware that the Flasko presale is nearly completely sold out. In a cryptocurrency market where Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) prices have fallen by 77% and 75%, respectively, Flasko appears to be the most prominent investment opportunity to consider.  Solana (SOL) Expecting Greater Improvements In The Future  One of the most well-known decentralized cryptocurrencies out there is Solana (SOL). It has received a great deal of praise for its quickness, efficacy, and sustainability. The hybrid technology that underlies Solana (SOL) has made a significant contribution to the aforementioned reality.  However, Solana (SOL) has recently suffered from a few big attacks. Solana (SOL) is anticipated to acquire greater momentum since the Solana(SOL) team is eager to provide fresh updates to tackle those weaknesses.  Cardano (ADA) Investors Are Looking For Alternative Investments  In the recent past, Cardano (ADA) could experience significant gains. However, it doesn’t seem to be showing the potential that it had sometime back. Therefore, it will not be possible to see Cardano (ADA)delivering impressive returns to investors in 2022 or 2023.  All investors looking forward to getting significant returns are let down by Cardano (ADA), and now they are looking for alternative investments.  Flasko (FLSK) Is The Best Cryptocurrency Investment To Consider Now  Flasko is a cryptocurrency based on a unique idea. It offers an alternative investment opportunity, where cryptocurrency investors can invest in NFTs. The most unique thing about Flasko is that these NFTs are backed up with real-world luxurious beverages, such as luxury wine, premium champagne, and expensive whiskey. The concept is solid, and it is attracting investors from all around the world. Anyone who has an interest in whiskeys, champagnes, and rare wines may go for it.  The presale of Flasko is taking place as of now. When the presale started, over 20 million tokens were sold within a period of just 60 seconds.  Any investor who wishes to invest in Flasko is not too late. The price is still going at $0.05. Since this is expected to rise by 4,000% by the beginning of 2023, anyone can quickly invest in Flasko accordingly.

"5",662,2022-10-10,"Decrypt","Vance Spencer discusses crypto regulations, DeFi investing, and the stigma of blockchain gaming.    The crypto bear market may have chilled public interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency, but venture capital firms like Framework Ventures continue to pour billions into the industry.  ""There are three paths,"" Framework Ventures co-founder Vance Spencer told Decrypt at Chainlink SmartCon. ""There is traditional DeFi, we're still investing in that. There's the regulated DeFi [products], which is just emergent. And then there are the regions like Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia—they just need the infrastructure to come online, so we're investing in that too.""  One area that Framework Ventures has focused on is blockchain gaming. The firm earmarked $200 million for the blockchain gaming industry in April through its .    ""People are excited about [blockchain] games because they're all launching Q1 [2023],"" Spencer said, adding that with so many games coming out at the same time, the industry is going to find out quickly if it is any good at game development.  ""Gaming and DeFi are two things that we do very tactically, because large markets are immediately available and we have use cases that exist currently,"" Spencer said.  But that is easier said than done. The promotion of blockchain or Web3 gaming has outpaced its design capability, and many in the gaming community see it as nothing more than a cash grab at gamers' expense.  ""The first iteration games were [like] Axie Infinity,"" Spencer said. ""That was hyper-financialized, potentially financial napalm,"" he said, noting what he called ""violent upswings and downswings"" of the market. But Spencer says he is optimistic about the next six to 12 months as more traditional games studios build games on-chain.  ""They probably won't have their own native token,"" he said. ""Maybe they put NFTs on-chain, or have monetization, and have the virtual currency as tokens,"" but will be more grounded in reality.  As Spencer explained, one issue slowing the adoption of blockchain or Web3 games is that they are known as blockchain Web3 games. That label carries years of baggage, including a negative environmental impact.  ""I think [not referencing blockchain or Web3] will be the recipe for success for the first iteration of games,"" Spencer said. ""We're bringing on people who play traditional games, and you don't want to inundate them with too much blockchain.""  Spencer went on to say that developers who use the blockchain to create better user and gaming experiences like virtual reality, augmented reality, and GPS-based games are the ones who will be successful.  ""A lot of people look at the 1,000 DeFi protocols that didn't succeed and are a little bit disheartened, but I choose to see the 50 that did work,"" Spencer said. ""You have to throw 1,000 startups at the wall for 50 to work.""    While regulation and the risk of driving blockchain innovation overseas is a concern, Spencer said he is optimistic that, in the end, it will create better investment opportunities.  ""I feel [it] presents an opportunity; you're gonna have DeFi in its current form, but that will be more overseas,"" he said. ""The [projects] in the U.S. are gonna have to fall into some regulatory jurisdiction.""  DeFi under regulatory oversight, Spencer explains, would be positive for the industry and will open it up to investors, the traditional banking system, and access to more capital.  ""There's going be some growing pains,"" he says. ""But the industry always needs to be changing and evolving and can't just be the same thing. And so we're pretty bullish on that. It's going to be a headache, but that's okay."""
"6",1943,2022-10-10,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Jerry Usman, an electrical engineer and tech writer.  Is progress being made toward green ? Absolutely! Despite the regulatory upheavals, reasonable progress has been made. Is Bitcoin green now? No, but at least Bitcoin’s greenhouse gas emissions are not where they used to be. According to the , Bitcoin’s greenhouse gas emissions dropped from 59 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in October 2021 to 48.88 metric tons today.  However, parliamentarians now have their gaze fixed on the proof-of-work consensus mechanism and are pushing for bitcoin mining to go green.  It’s a known fact that Bitcoin’s growing energy consumption has drawn criticism from environmentalists. Bitcoin miners must overcome the primordial sentiments that are often flung at emerging technologies that society seems initially uncomfortable with; consider Western Union’s internal memo from 1876: “This 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.” The sentiments have remained the same. One should not be surprised when bitcoin becomes a standard for future currencies.  Some may have expected that the  in 2015 would spur Bitcoin toward the more sustainable path of renewable energy. However, one shouldn’t be surprised by the apathy of Bitcoin’s accusers concerning the positive gains recorded with its limiting of carbon dioxide emissions.  Is solar mining the answer to the Bitcoin energy problem? Partially. Optimizing available energy and expanding working options requires a multidimensional approach. Various strategies include load balancing, energy swaps, hybrid systems and additional battery storage. The multiplier effect of increased government subsidies — an incentivized effort to speed up green energy adoption — could further cut solar installation costs.  A general overview of these energy solutions and their adoption is provided below.  Bitcoin’s Global Power Consumption  Bitcoin’s  stands at 253 TWh, approximately 0.15% of total global energy consumption. The Bitcoin network has achieved a more green power mix than Germany.  According to the Bitcoin Mining Council’s 2022 report, 59.5% of the total bitcoin mining global energy comes from renewable sources, which is a good sign of progress. The council further reported a 46% increase in efficiency on a year-on-year basis due to increased mining efficiency and improved semiconductor technology.  Let’s get a rough sense of the current cost of bitcoin mining.  What Is The Average Profitability Of Bitcoin Mining?  Taking the powerful and popular bitcoin miner Antminer S19 Pro, rated at 3250 watts, it . This will cost $7.80 per day, at the rate of $0.10 per kWh, this yields a . This is not a good scenario.  Cooling cost and a 50% discharge limit for lithium-ion batteries could further ramp up the price to mine bitcoin due to usable capacity. However, profitability is primarily impacted by electricity cost and mining difficulty. With cheap electricity, mining remains profitable regardless of bitcoin price.  Solar mining and other viable hybrids provide excellent alternatives. Though an element of geography and capital seems to be an advantage to mining success.  Different options exist to fast-track the green energy revolution with numerous benefits for bitcoin mining. The potential is incredible when we look at other green energy sources, but let’s get a glimpse of solar first.  Solar Energy And Mining Growth  Solar is now termed “the cheapest energy source.” The levelized cost of energy places  ahead of other energy sources.  As the energy source with the fastest growth rate, solar power today supplies around , producing zero noise pollution while possessing high scalability. Unlike relatively scarce geothermal, solar has worldwide potential.  The deployment of solar in conjunction with bitcoin mining continues to gain traction among entrepreneurs. ., a new bitcoin mining firm, has begun mining at a 6 megawatt (MW) solar-powered plant in western Colorado amid the current bear market.  However, wind and solar are significantly utilized in Texas, a booming place for bitcoin mining.  According to Shaun Connell, Executive VP of Power at Houston-based tech company Lancium, “You get this perfect overlap with both sun quality and wind speed in West Texas.”  Texas will continue to play a vital role in the green energy market. However, China remains a global leader in solar manufacturing and total installed capacity, contributing 15.4% of non-fossil fuels to its energy mix with a  by 2025.  Photovoltaic panels and solar radiation-concentrating mirrors are increasingly being used to harness solar energy as technology continues to advance.  Biomass Deployment In Bitcoin Mining  Biomass accounts for approximately , 5% of  and 1.4% of the . The bulk of this energy is used for heating and other industrial processes, which has significant environmental advantages that extend to improving hygiene by recycling waste materials and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  In the race to a sustainable bitcoin mining industry, using biodegradable materials as fuel for electricity production is not out of place. It may not provide a more significant arbitrage when paired against solar, but investing in these energy alternatives from an advantage remains the best.  Generation Hemp just partnered with Cryptic Solutions in an attempt to utilize hemp as biofuel to run its mining hardware. , Generation Hemp Chairman and CEO Gary Evans said:  “We decided that the ideal place to initiate our first green bitcoin mining operation was right in our own backyard. We are located in an industrial park of western Kentucky with ample low-cost electric availability and a very friendly business environment.”  Using biodegradable waste from farms to generate electricity to mine bitcoin is an interesting way to economically deploy otherwise wasted materials that could be a source of land and water contamination, but instead creates carbon dioxide emissions when these resources are now used for mining bitcoin. It is likely that using these types of biowaste materials for bitcoin mining will be more impactful for society by preventing health issues that arise with contamination than the carbon dioxide emissions they create. That being said, scalability of these solutions remains a significant concern.  Can Bitcoin Be Mined With Wind Energy?  With a 25-year service life for wind turbines, it is more rewarding for bitcoin mining than solar power when maintenance is considered.  Wind speed, air density and swept area serve as reminders that location is crucial when it comes to wind energy. Constrained by the , engineers have been exploring design options that provide the best optimization of wind turbine efficiency while reducing cost. Horizontal axis turbines are standard. However, bladeless turbine concepts are gaining ground, though they can’t be seen as significant competitors.  Wind power designs are experiencing accelerated improvement in design efficiency . Implementing more wind-powered mining systems will improve the renewable energy mix of bitcoin mining. However, wind power suffers the same fate as solar and will require batteries for shortfalls during less windy periods. Also, it’s best scaled by adding energy to the grid in a distributed model.  Wind energy is efficient, inexhaustible and affordable. Wind energy is the  in the United States and growing. However, if not carefully planned, wind installations create noise and pose environmental concerns.  Hydropower And Bitcoin Mining?  Hydropower has the highest energy  of up to 90%, the highest among renewable energy options, the most reliable and it maintains the .  Alps Blockchain, an Italian startup, is one firm that has deployed the use of hydropower for  With an energy firm struggling to cover its facility maintenance costs, it was easy for Alps Blockchain to purchase more than 40 state-of-the-art ASIC miners at a cheaper rate and resell the computing power worldwide.  Hydropower is stable and affordable. It remains one of the earliest and most adopted energy sources. It accounts for over  generation and is the most stable mining option requiring no backups. It’s worth noting that great apathy exists among engineers and scientists when referring to hydropower as renewable, considering its environmental impact.  Load Balancing Of Renewable Options  Incentivized load curtailment at peak demand periods will continue in an attempt to flatten losses. Miners’ involvement remains relevant, but wholesale prices have fallen due to the solar value deflation caused by the time-locked supply of solar energy, resulting in utilities paying less for solar.  The growing market for electric cars and the Bitcoin network offer profitable alternatives to the industry’s solar value decline. Solar bitcoin mining could reduce solar value deflation to a great extent while reducing the need for generated energy curtailment, at the same time freeing up power during peak demand, especially when grid-dependent backups are incorporated.  Long Distance Energy Swap  Superconducting commercial direct current (DC) power transmission will reduce significant losses in realizing underwater long-distance power transmission (intercontinental level inclusive). High-voltage DC use has recorded both success and failure in this ambitious attempt. A recent popular project is the  (ASEAN) solar power line.  Time-limited solar and other seasonal energy resources with tremendous abundance could be swapped between regions with similar characteristics having opposite availability periods.  It’s important to note that long-distance energy swaps pose a significant security risk when used as a primary power source if maintenance and emergencies are taken into account. These same systems have tremendous advantages when used as backup power.  One illustration is Denmark and Norway’s , which provides energy for Denmark when there is no wind. It’s interesting how Norway’s mountainous water resources complement Denmark’s high seasonal winds.  Increased Storage To Optimize Solar Mining  Technological improvements have helped offset solar value depreciation, especially in batteries.  The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it an advantage to have intermittent power supplies added to the network, which makes it profitable for the energy grid and investors at the same time while also maintaining a decentralized ecosystem.  Battery scaling has become the go-to choice for miners seeking to reap the full benefits of their investments. Blockstream and payment firm Block have partnered with Tesla to construct an entirely off-grid,  using renewable energy. This includes deploying 3.8 MW of solar panels with four Tesla Megapack battery units.  Continuous Increase In Bitcoin Mining Efficiency  Bitcoin’s carbon footprint is dropping drastically as mining efficiency continues to improve on a recorded 63% year-over-year basis. According to the Bitcoin Mining Council, a six-fold improvement is expected with the Bitcoin protocol and efficiency in mining within the next eight years.  Final Thoughts  A hybrid renewable energy system has proven greater efficiency in electricity production, which can only mean more profitability for mining. With perfect geography, the solar-wind hybrid system is sustainable.  The combined impact of technological advancement, government subsidies and hybrid renewable systems can trigger the transition to green energy at a breakneck speed. Utilizing energy balancing techniques, curtailment and increased storage will put the lid on mitigating the inefficiency in expending available power, support efforts to combat climate change and pave the way for greater profitability in bitcoin mining.

As the technology scales, new blockchains must be green.  You might have heard the saying, “Bitcoin uses more electricity than Argentina,"" which is no longer true. Bitcoin miners are increasingly using . Also, blockchain protocols that don't need energy-intensive consensus models are emerging.  This article explains how the blockchain industry is revamping its technical architecture to ensure growth and sustainability.  What is ESG, and why does it matter?   (Environmental, Social, and Governance) measures the environmental, social, and governance impacts of a firm or investment. Socially conscious investors use it to filter possible investments based on a set of globally agreed standards for a company's operations.  Global enterprises, businesses, and organizations must enhance their ESG scores to remain relevant and competitive. This helps battle climate change and other challenges.  Plan A says enterprises must decarbonize, create ESG framework and reporting, reach net-zero emissions, and create a resilient and sustainable supply chain.  Blockchain technology can alleviate some of these difficulties using  's distributed ledger technology (DLT). Supply chain management, which affects carbon emissions the most, might employ DLT to improve ESG.  Blockchains can synchronize organizations' record-keeping systems, allowing them to openly reveal ESG indicators and confirm their environmental commitment.  Blockchain makes supply chain tracking more efficient, transparent, and verifiable. It stores supply chain and sustainability data immutably.  In recent years, the number of investment funds incorporating ESG issues has  and is likely to continue rising in this decade. ESG investments could reach tens of  of dollars in the next decades.  Blockchains aiming for carbon neutrality – a big win for ESG  Bitcoin introduced us to blockchain, and its success is built on the network security maintained by its  mining consensus mechanism. It requires large amounts of computing power, and thus electricity, to verify transactions in order to add new blocks to the chain.  Since the first Bitcoin block was mined, the crypto industry has improved technologically and produced more eco-friendly blockchain solutions. For instance, PoW-to-PoS transition is key to greener tech.   is a more sustainable consensus process than PoW. To verify transactions and add new blocks, PoS validators stake their currencies. This reduces electricity use and carbon emissions. Block rewards are divided among node validators, with higher-staked validators having a better chance. Even , the second-largest crypto asset, has  to PoS.  Many of the earlier Layer-1 blockchains are slow, have high transaction fees, and leave a larger environmental footprint than is acceptable.  All the top developers are working on cutting-edge protocols to solve Ethereum co-founder  's , which is how to balance security, speed, and scalability. When all blockchains accomplish this, the earth will benefit.  One of the major challenges for massive blockchain adoption is scalability  As blockchain adoption grows, most networks' designs create operational bottlenecks that stop them from growing. , which combine transactions and send them back to Layer 1, are one of the most common ways to fix this problem. This speeds up the process and frees up block space.  Many of these Layer 2s are also better for the environment. For example, validators use about 0.00079TWh of electricity per year, while Bitcoin - the biggest PoW chain - consumes ~ . There is a big difference.  Scalability is a problem for both Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work networks. Bitcoin, which, after the Ethereum Merge, is the only major chain that still uses PoW, has solutions for scaling up that also minimize power consumption.  For example, , which is used in  to scale daily Bitcoin transactions, can grow in a way that is not proportional to how much energy it uses.  This minimizes the required energetic input. Energy optimization goes hand in hand with scalability, which is needed to expand the use of blockchain technology.  Proof-of-stake is not the only sustainable consensus mechanism  PoW and PoS are the most widely used consensus algorithms. However, PoS is not the only consensus mechanism that does not require a lot of energy.  (PoA) takes advantage of the value of identities. This means that block validators don't stake coins, but rather their reputations. PoA doesn't require mining or any specific amount of energy (besides to be operative).  Its technical architecture allows high transparency and speed, making POA a pretty good solution for  applications (supply chain).  Consequently, it is the consensus mechanism used by veChain, the most relevant crypto protocol applied to logistics. PoS is a more efficient consensus mechanism for other types of use cases such as decentralized finance (  ), non-fungible tokens (  ), or  because of its lower barriers to entry, reduced hardware requirements, etc.  Many of the methods blockchain can be utilized to solve problems are ESG compliant.  Looking forward  Global blockchain leaders are reducing carbon emissions.

"11",999,2022-10-08,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Makoto Shibuya, a licensed architect with an accomplished portfolio of personal and professional projects.  Introduction  I tend to believe that every challenge is also an opportunity. Cities developed over centuries, but the world is changing quickly. Though there is a healthy debate about what a future city may look like, if we were to design a city knowing what we know now, we can presume they would look quite different.  Architecture is difficult, complicated and rooted in a lot of history and tradition. Yet, it is one of our oldest practices — we needed a roof over our heads before we could sit and think about anything else. Unfortunately, this combination of complexity, tradition and permanence has historically kept the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry at the mercy of changing technology rather than its forefront. Change is difficult, especially for something built on centuries of precedent.  Whether we like it or not, that will have to change as the world recognizes what some have been warning about for decades. Though the numbers are evolving, we know   Thesis  Bitcoin introduces a market-based economic incentive for net-positive energy projects, which in addition to reducing CO2 emissions, could help offset the embodied carbon of our infrastructure over time.  A Case Study  In 1945, the “  ” was commissioned to help reimagine housing after World War II. While some of the projects were never built, it was an important and influential contribution to the modern architecture movement. Today, we face a different challenge — we know buildings collectively contribute about 40% of global CO2 emissions.  Zero is a case study to explore new opportunities around renewable energy infrastructure and Bitcoin. The ultimate goal is to accelerate net-zero carbon projects through renewable energy technology, material selection and carbon removal strategies. I understand there are many nuances around environmental concerns, and I am merely flexing some design ideas to see where I land.  On its face, the energy consumption of a “proof-of-work” system like Bitcoin may seem like an inherent problem, but complex issues require looking at the entire system. When thinking about this, it is important to decouple energy from carbon emissions. Energy use is not intrinsically a bad thing. Everything requires energy — it is part of the first law of thermodynamics.  In summary, the problem with energy has never been about scarcity but rather intermittency, storage and distribution. For the first time in history, energy has a buyer of last resort — bitcoin miners — that can take stranded or surplus energy from anywhere and convert it into a global digital asset. Mining bitcoin introduces a perpetual appetite for stranded, or surplus, energy which can augment traditional net metering and energy storage. Mining makes it possible to monetize the buildout and operation of a solar system from day one rather than waiting for permits to sell back to the grid, which can often take months. It is another valuable tool that is geographically independent. This new demand acts as a continuous inducement for renewable energy and further innovation in energy infrastructure.  Combining renewable energy sources with batteries enables people to be their own utility. Mining could add another tool to help balance their renewable energy economics. This additional utility lets households, campuses and cities design a renewable energy system that will meet all of their power needs without the risk of overbuilding. Traditionally, this has been uneconomical because the system needed to be designed for peak loads. This new ability to economically design for these extended loads, in turn, continues to improve the economics of renewable energy infrastructure.  Energy Management  Below is a diagram showing how  could complement energy storage and net metering. The heat generated by the mining hardware is then used to pre-heat domestic water used around the house.  Waste Heat  The waste heat (a by-product of mining bitcoin) is used to pre-heat domestic water around the house. In the winter, it is also used as radiant heat for the floor.  Solar Energy  ""Capturing just one hour of the sunshine that hits our planet would enable us to meet the world's food and energy needs for an entire year, and each year the sun radiates more energy onto the earth than has been used in the whole of human history.""  Sun Angle  The roof could be designed to cut off the sun angle in the summer and allow it to seep in during the winter. In the summer, this helps control the temperature from overheating. In the winter, the sun is allowed to heat the floor and radiate heat throughout the space over the course of the night. Adjustable sliding shades provide another level of local sun control.  Rain  Rainwater is collected into a water feature and stored in an underground water cistern. In the summer, as this water evaporates, it pre-cools the air before entering the building. Combining this with strategically located operable windows allows cool air to cross-ventilate through the residence, saving energy on air conditioning.  The Power Of An Image  After World War II, the original “Case Study Houses” appeared in the “Arts & Architecture” magazine in iconic black and white photographs. These photographs spread California's mid-century architecture around the world and were influential to the modern architecture movement. In a similar spirit, I have created several images capturing project Zero to help paint a vision. It is not yet a complete picture — it is merely a case study to test ideas. Admittedly, there are details to work out and improvements to be made. However, the intention is to have an ongoing process to test ideas in hopes of a sustainable future.

"15",441,2022-10-07,"Blockchain.News","Crypto miner Greenridge Generation is on a mission to raise up to $22.8 million.  A US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing dated October 3 showed that the firm seeks to do so in an at-the-market offering.  The US-based bitcoin mining company has signed a sales deal with B. Riley Securities for the Class A common stock offer, which will give the investment bank up to 5% of the gross proceeds from the offer.  In the filing, Greenridge wrote, ""we (the company) currently plan to use the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting B. Riley's commissions and offering expenses payable by us, for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, paying or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness at the time, and funding acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital.""  In March, the bitcoin mining company had secured $100 million in funds to help enlarge its operations in the US.  The total sum included $81.4 million as a loan from an affiliate of NYDIG and $26.5 million as a promissory note with a B. Riley Financial, Inc cohort.  Even though Greenridge announced that its mining production increased by about 18% in June, it is seemingly looking to raise funds as it reported a second-quarter loss of $107.9 million.  According to its monthly operating update from June, Greenridge said it produced approximately 230 Bitcoins, an increase of about 18%, compared to 195 Bitcoins it mined in May.  The miner disclosed that it increased its hashrate capacity to 2.5 exahash per second (""EH/s"") from 27,500 mining machines in June, an increase from 1.7 EH/s of mining capacity from 20,400 mining machines in the previous month.  Greenridge stated that it ordered an additional 200 mining machines, which are in transit, as they will be installed upon their arrival.  Following the company's second-quarter losses, it announced in August that it would pause its expansion plans in Texas. It cited a ""sudden change in mining economics"" and said it would focus on its South Carolina and New York locations.  However, the New York Department of Environmental Conservation denied the bitcoin mining company's air permit renewal in June as it did not meet the requirements of state climate laws.  In a statement, NYSDEC said that Greenridge's application was inconsistent with the climate goals highlighted by the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which focuses on reducing New York's greenhouse gas emission by at least 85% by 2050."
"16",634,2022-10-06,"CryptoDaily","This cute cat has been gripping the hearts and minds of investors ever since it opened for presale. Several weeks later, three stages passed, over $3.92 million already raised, and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is making a serious name for itself.  Another win for this adorable feline is that it will be released to tier one crypto exchange, CEX.io, once the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) presale is over. A tier 1 cryptocurrency exchange listing with good customer reviews will generate further trust in Big Eyes Coin’s credibility and thus encourage investments.  Although Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is experiencing an unprecedented amount of presale success, does it have what it takes to challenge Floxi Inu (FLOXI) and Doge Dash (DOGEDASH)?  Floxi Inu Has Not Returned To Its Peak  A meme currency created after Elon Musk tweeted that the name of his Shiba Inu dog would be Floki, Floxi Inu aims to put real-world utility and charity into the meme token space.  Unfortunately, this token is quite volatile. It took a couple of months from its initial release to reach its all-time highest price, however, by 2022, this has dropped by more than half. In the last month alone, the price of Floxi Inu (FLOXI) has fallen even further.  Doge Dash Is Showing Promise This Week  Doge Dash (DOGEDASH) is a fun and colourful cryptocurrency which is mainly utilised in a play-to-earn, Super Mario-inspired game named Doge Dash. There are ten levels to play through. Users who perform well will appear on a daily leaderboard. Every day, 100 of the best performing players will be rewarded with tokens.  Although, upon release its price grew, shortly later, the value already began to drop. Currently, Doge Dash (DOGEDASH) is experiencing a seven-day upward trend, however, it is unclear whether this will continue when the likes of competitor Tamadoge (TAMA) are performing much better.  Is Big Eyes Coin A Serious Contender For Floxi Inu And Doge Dash?  Based on the data from Big Eyes Coin’s presale, this cute cat is selling at an alarming rate. Part of this sales rush is being generated by the dedicated 5% of all Big Eyes tokens towards a marketing wallet. The result of this dedicated marketing budget can be seen in the growing social media handles and influencer endorsements by crypto influences Ieda Wobeto (@iedawobetoreal) and Rafa (@RafaaCerro). But there are other sources for Big Eyes Coin’s surprising success.  One of the purposes of Big Eyes’ creation was to raise awareness about oceanic environments. In the cat’s terms, “save the fish. So we can eat the fish”. A dedicated charity wallet has been created so that 5% of the total tokens available at launch can be sent to ocean sanctuaries. Recent publications, including a UK government study, have also highlighted that around 75% of the adult sample claimed they were worried about climate change. If this is true, then Big Eyes is speaking to people's concerns.  But perhaps the most dominant reason why Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is a competitor to Floxi Inu (FLOXI) and Doge Dash (DOGEDASH) is that, unlike other presale cryptocurrencies, Big Eyes has plans on how to sustain its growth in the long run: a strong community, social media following, NFT collections, Merchandise and events. This all forms the package which will make Big Eyes Coin (BIG) this year's promising cryptocurrency.    Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

"18",321,2022-10-05,"Bitcoin Magazine","The European Union (EU) has agreed on a legal framework for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies known as Markets in Crypto Asset Regulation (MiCA), per a report from .  The bill was signed off by members of the EU Council on Wednesday and consists of a regulatory framework previously established in June, which reportedly received no further development since then.  MiCA establishes licensing requirements for exchanges and wallet providers across the 27 member countries of the EU, including a need for checking user identity. Additionally, the legislation imposes capital requirements for the aforementioned service providers. The capital requirements are expected to prevent depegging events such as was seen with the downfall of the  ecosystem, as well as preventing other major liquidity issues.  While the full text of the legislation is currently sealed, the bill is expected to be covered by the EU’s official journal before it would go into effect in 2024.  The EU has also placed bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at the forefront of its agenda for the upcoming International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank annual meeting, per a  report.  “We have a crowded agenda for the US next week, and one of the items that won’t be at the bottom of the list, it will be in there right around the top is crypto,” said Mairead McGuinness, EU commissioner for financial services.  With the looming implementation of MiCA, the EU will be the first attempt globally at creating a regulatory framework at this scale. However, regulators in the EU are awaiting the upcoming meeting to discuss regulation with the U.S., as the European regulators hold that it will take a global effort to truly establish a reliable framework.  “[Regulation], a little bit like climate change, addressing crypto alone in the EU is not enough, we need to have global engagement and sharing of experience, '' said McGuinness."
"19",1340,2022-10-05,"CryptoDaily","The gaming world is filled with a myriad of pioneering figures who helped shape the industry into what it is today. These are people who are willing to push the boundaries of gaming whilst also understanding and satisfying their audience along the process. One of these figures is Marc Albinet, a true veteran of the industry. Albinet joined the gaming world during its inception in 1988, where he began his career at Ubisoft. One of the first games he worked on was Unreal (1990), a genre-fusing game that incorporated side-scrolling levels along with rail shooting mechanics. The game received high acclaim, being named the second-best shooting game of its year by the magazine Amiga Joker. This was just the beginning of Albinet’s career, as he worked his way up to become game director for Assassin’s Creed Unity in 2017, and the more recently acclaimed title, Dying Light 2.  As of lately, Albinet has been working to find new methods of creating and building games, driving him into the world of blockchain technology. He joined Darewise Entertianment as Creative Director, a game development studio focused heavily on web3 tools and infrastructures. Albinet is the company’s creative director, where he is spearheading an MMORPG named Life Beyond– powered by blockchain tech. With a career spent interlocked within the gaming world, Albinet has many important insights on the industry, especially on the web3 wave of games currently being created. Let’s delve into his thoughts and see what he makes of the future of this industry.  Marc Albinet’s Vision of the Future  The following is an interview with Marc Albinet regarding the intersection between gaming and web3 technologies.  1- What role does Blockchain play in the gaming industry?  Currently, blockchain is used in Play-to-Earn games, which represents a small market that is essentially mobile (with some PC involvement). The console side is not proposing any blockchain elements at the moment. Not only this, but most of the big titles targeting massive audiences are not blockchain related at all. The reasons are that the Web3 market is small and cryptocurrency is not really popular inside traditional game development communities. But despite that, things are moving forward with several big publishers like UbiSoft and Square Enix seriously considering areas like player-ownership– offered by blockchain technology. Therefore, we can expect more important movements to occur in the near future.  2- Do you think that AAA games are the answer to Blockchain Games’ sustainability? If so, why?  Blockchain sustainability will come when the core value of these games will have evolved from a pure speculative reason to invest, into long-term value via the experience provided by games in the industry. The answer is less a question of scope and ambition than a question of core value and experience quality. AAA publishers are slowly considering injecting blockchain concepts into their games. But there is no need to wait for AAA to act when any studio can make great games using blockchain technology, and offer great options such as true ownership and reward mechanisms.  3- In your opinion, what’s the best way to build a sustainable game economy using NFTs?  A game is sustainable when you want to come back in the long run. Investing in fast speculation is not sustainable. So the question is, what is it about a game that makes people come back? The quality of its experience, the quality of its immersion, and the possibility to share it with other people where you can interact and have fun with them in an often constructive manner. For NFT-based games to make an impact, they will have to propose this type of value. NFTs will need to become meaningful to be part of the experience. The reflection of it will become meaningful and gain value because this value will be shared by the community. That is our philosophy and direction: creating an experience that is not only in the game but also in our lives, so that we can build with our community so every time we release an NFT, it is part of what we share and all like: the World of Dolos (the planet which players will explore in Life Beyond) and all experiences related to it.  4- What is LifeBeyond doing differently than current NFT games?  After building the first bricks of the game and its World, we are now focusing on building the whole World and experience. Our previous alpha was created to demonstrate our ability to deliver good gameplay and our next steps are now to build the whole experience, which is the development of a whole new society on another planet. We propose people become part of the journey and build it with us; both in-game and out of the game itself.  5- Are in-game NFT’s going to outbalance non-NFT holders? How do you Balance NFTs in-game so that the experience doesn’t turn into a Pay-To-Win game?  NFT owners will never unbalance the game. This is for various reasons, but here are the main ones. First, we will release NFTs that have in-game utilities but these will never be attached to a challenge, so we will never release NFTs that offer better stats. We will provide NFTs alongside other in-game functionalities like a robot that is able to guard your Land or house when you’re IRL and able to warn you IRL if someone is entering it. Players will also have the ability to upgrade their tools, equipment or weapons and sell them via NFTs.  Another important aspect is that we are building the game over the concept of expertise. Every player will have the opportunity to become an expert in at least one domain (possibly several, just a question of playtime). Some players will be experts in mining, some in building, some others in surveying underground, etc… We will build a whole economy so dozens of expertise options will be available. For every expertise, a tool will be needed. Working on your expertise will level up the tools. Your avatar will also level up but in only one stat. For combat, it will be your life. So leveling up your avatar by playing combat will provide you a better weapon level (with better stats) and a bigger life gauge. Your own skills in combat will also be important; like in any other game. The more you play the more you develop your skills. Weapons (expertise tools) will be possible to sell or buy via NFT, while your avatar won’t and obviously neither will your skills. So any of your friends will be able to play with you by buying the top-notch weapon even in difficult missions, but they will still have a short life gauge and bad skills in combat. That’s the way we will prevent the Pay-to-Win aspect. We let NFTs coming from players have a buyable value in the challenge, but it’s only a part of the equation.  A Blockchain-Based Gaming Industry  It is clear from Marc Albinet’s ideas that he believes the next evolution of gaming will be brought about by blockchain and web3 tech. The significance of these tools has been fully realized in the financial world, and it is now beginning to be realized in the entertainment industry. Pioneers such as Albinet are trendsetters in this space, using next-gen technologies to provide greater user experiences.  Right now, web3 games appear to lie on the fringes of the gaming sphere, but as the technology matures, and as individuals such as Albinet continue to utilize it, these types of games will become a fully ingrained part of the gaming space. They may even become the norm.  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only. It is not offered or intended to be used as legal, tax, investment, financial, or other advice."
"20",3412,2022-10-05,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Peter McCormack, a podcaster and filmmaker, the host of “What Bitcoin Did” and chairman of Real Bedford FC.  Over seven years ago, Ross Ulbricht was handed a double life sentence plus 40 years, without the possibility of parole. The U.S. government wants him to die in prison. The justification for such a sentence asks big questions of both the morality of the laws he was sentenced under and the judicial framework which allows for what is essentially a death sentence.  The story of Ulbricht, Silk Road, the investigation and his resultant sentencing is subjective. To some, it was an audacious and brave test of libertarianism within a system that is openly antagonistic to such actions. To others, it was the rightful incarceration of a drug dealer who caused intolerable harm. In addition, Ulbricht’s story includes accusations of assassination attempts, questions regarding the constitutional aspects of the investigation, corruption within the police, the emergent need to protect online privacy and, of course, bitcoin.  Most of the debate around Silk Road has rightly focused on whether the net societal impacts of providing a fully unregulated marketplace are positive or negative. It is the personal story behind the headlines that resonates with me, given that I’m in the same peer group as Ulbricht, share similar outlooks and interests and was an occasional user of Silk Road in its early days. That is the prism through which my views have been molded. However, while I have strong opinions, I don’t feel as though I have a morally superior view. There are plenty of people who have very troubling personal experiences, which means they will come to different conclusions about Ulbricht than I have.  Ulbricht’s punishment was related directly to the nonviolent activities associated with running Silk Road, namely: distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents and conspiring to commit money laundering. It is the consideration of these acts on which my opinions of Ulbricht’s case rest.  Ulbricht is a young, well-educated, articulate man who has outstanding entrepreneurial skills and who harnessed the capacity of various technical innovations to bring something new to the world. The consideration by Trump in 2020 to pardon Ulbricht drew particular criticism. Nick Bilton, who  about Ulbricht’s case, stated in a 2020 , “I find it reprehensible that people on social media are so adamant that Ulbricht should be freed because he performed his crimes from behind a computer.”  Bilton’s argument was that there are currently half a million U.S. citizens incarcerated for drug offenses, with numerous examples of extensive life-changing sentences for much lesser crimes than those of Ulbricht. This calls into question how unfairly the current war on drugs targets certain social groups, which is an argument I would confidently assume the majority of Ulbricht’s backers would agree with. Ulbricht’s case is emblematic of the systemic failure of the war on drugs; it is not an outlier whose publicity and narrative are questionable because of relative privilege.  More importantly, Ulbricht has not looked to be treated differently by the justice system. Yes, his legal team put up a range of defenses to support his case, as is his right. Yet, once the judgment was made, Ulbricht accepted his mistakes as well as his need to be held accountable. At his original trial in 2015, prior to sentencing, Ulbricht heard the testimony from some of the parents of six victims identified to have died after consuming drugs bought via Silk Road. After hearing this, , “I never wanted that to happen. I wish I could go back and convince myself to take a different path.” Then, prior to sentencing, Ulbricht , “I know you must take away my middle years, but please leave me my old age. Please leave a small light at the end of the tunnel, an excuse to stay healthy, an excuse to dream of better days ahead, and a chance to redeem myself before I meet my maker.” He was 31 at the time.  While Ulbricht admitted his guilt and culpability, it is still worth considering whether sending people to jail indefinitely for providing access to drugs is a reasonable action in a civilized society. Again, there are multiple angles to this issue and both sides of the argument have merit. Drug abuse is a massive societal issue with many tragic victims. It is hard to maintain a pro-drug stance if you have witnessed the impact on places like Los Angeles’ Skid Row, San Francisco’s Tenderloin area or Downtown Eastside in Vancouver.  But there is another side to this debate that does merit discussion. Essentially, should human beings be banned from ingesting substances because of the societal harm that can be inflicted? We allow access to alcohol which, when abused, is arguably one of the most destructive drugs in the world. We also embrace drugs for an increasing range of medical conditions: Over  in the U.S. and are used by , most of whom are seeking to reduce blood pressure, relieve pain or mitigate mental health issues. These drugs too can be abused and lead to widespread societal harm, something I’ll touch on later. To some, the banning of certain classes of drugs for recreational or medicinal purposes is an arbitrary decision based on prejudice, ignorance and attitudes rooted in political and religious dogma.  Silk Road was first and foremost a platform for those wishing to take drugs recreationally. As I have documented in previous interviews, I used Silk Road directly for personal use. Silk Road enabled me to get easier access to my drug of choice. I abused that opportunity, and there are numerous stories of lives ruined by such activity. However, I also benefited from accessing the online community within Silk Road that provided open discussion forums predicated on supporting those struggling with addiction. That’s not to say that the Silk Road was an attempt to help people get off drugs, but neither was it a community looking to ruthlessly exploit those suffering from addiction without any concern for their well-being.  I also benefited from the measures Silk Road implemented to improve quality control. It is a known problem that an underground drug trade facilitates unscrupulous behavior where dealers seek to maximize returns by adulterating the product. This results in bad experiences, illness and even death. Such practices are widespread. In 2004, an  from drug seizures in the 1990s found that up to 20% of the pills contained no MDMA, but were instead comprised of caffeine, ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol or placebo. In 2018, 150 people in Illinois  because they were bleeding uncontrollably after using synthetic cannabis-based products that contained rat poison. In 2021, three comedians famously died in LA after taking cocaine laced with fentanyl. Fentanyl is turning up in all kinds of drugs, which is contributing to U.S. annual  for the first time in 2021 — a five-fold increase since 2000; that’s one person dying of an overdose in the U.S. every 5 minutes. A medical toxicologist  stated, “Buying drugs on the street is a game of Russian roulette. From Xanax to cocaine, drugs or counterfeit pills purchased in nonmedical settings may contain life-threatening amounts of fentanyl.” Fentanyl is “used as an adulterant because its high potency allows dealers to traffic smaller quantities but maintain the drug effects buyers expect.”  Silk Road, through its user-review system that sought to mimic legal retail sites, gamified the supply of drugs to reward those providing better-quality products. It was by no means a guarantee of minimum quality nor, obviously, could it be described as a safety feature, but it was mitigation for an issue that is causing unknown harm. Professor C. Michael White of the University of Connecticut studied this activity and reported on it in 2021, coming to similar conclusions to other medical experts, “The research is clear: Adding impurities to, or adulterating, illicit drugs is a longstanding and widespread practice with harmful consequences … the difference between what you believe you are buying and what is actually in the product can be the difference between life and death.”  Then there is the fact the vendor and buyer are physically separated. While trying to avoid cliches, those seeking drugs are more likely to be vulnerable people, while those selling drugs are more likely to be associated with other crimes and have violent tendencies. Having drug transactions forced underground means that vendors are forced to interact with buyers. This opens up all manor of risks, directly related to the interaction and indirectly to the locations where such interactions take place. There are short-term risks associated with specific transactions and longer-term risks associated with exploitative relationships that can develop. Silk Road broke this link. The Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit organization, stated that Silk Road was  for buyers and sellers. In a 2015 article, they asserted that Silk Road “gave us a new way to imagine better management of the drug trade … We need something better than what we have now, which is nothing but failure, cartels and beheadings, mass incarceration, mandatory minimums, a vibrant and throbbing illicit market, and a prison industrial complex totally out of control.”  An important (albeit potentially small) cohort of those who used Silk Road did so to gain access to drugs for medicinal purposes. While Ulbricht was not explicitly motivated to meet the specific needs of those failed by conventional health care, this is an important factor to account for, and again, something for which I used Silk Road. There are clearly valid concerns regarding the risks of people self-medicating. Nevertheless, there is also a critical need to respect the needs of those suffering from illnesses seeking treatments outside of official medicinal practices. There are those facing the worst challenges in life, desperate to relieve chronic pain, extreme mental anguish or even people facing death. If these people want to seek drugs that are not available to them through official means, is it right that society denies them this choice?  While it is true that prescribed drugs are subject to strict clinical trials, there are also valid concerns that other drugs — which have equally powerful medicinal, therapeutic and life-affirming effects — have been arbitrarily prohibited. This includes psychedelics and MDMA, which are showing promise in the treatment of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and cannabis, which I know from personal experience that many people are desperate to use for a range of known and powerful benefits. The British Medical Journal reported in December last year that  in kids treated with whole plant medicinal cannabis. Although cannabis products in the U.K. were made legal for patients with “exceptional clinical need” in July 2018, according to a 2021 report in The Economist, parents are struggling to access prescriptions: “Just three children … have been given prescriptions by the National Health Service.” It is perverse cruelty that prevents people from obtaining widely available, but illegal drugs that have been proven to uniquely diminish suffering.  “Reasonable people may and do disagree about the social utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances, or even of criminal prohibition of their sale and use at all. It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use.” These were not the words of any libertarian activist seeking to shine a light on Ulbricht’s case; these were the  in their determination of Ulbricht’s appeal in 2017. The court affirmed the original sentence given to Ulbricht in 2015, but as the opinion attests, it is clear that they were uncomfortable with having to apply U.S. drug laws. If the legal profession enforcing the laws openly questions those very laws, surely we have approached a time for some reasoned debate.  Beyond the arguments about access to drugs within society, Ulbricht’s case brings into question the validity of penalties imposed on behalf of the state. The sentence handed down to Ulbricht — imprisoning him for the rest of his life — is a punishment reserved for the most heinous criminals. Such punishment is illegal in a number of countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Portugal, Croatia and the Vatican City: The Pope  as a hidden type of death sentence. The Penal Reform International , “Life imprisonment without parole, in particular, raises issues of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, and undermines the right to human dignity by taking away the prospect of rehabilitation.” Even among those countries that apply full life sentences, there are large disparities in the extent to which it is applied: In France in 2014, 0.7 per 100,000 inhabitants were serving life sentences while in the U.S., it was over 50 people per 100,000 inhabitants.  Then there is the issue of comparable harm. It is a tricky area to compare different crimes in terms of harm, but in determining the sentencing of Ulbricht, as stated, the court heard testimony from the families of six people who died after consuming drugs bought from Silk Road. Therefore, this is a reasonable measure by which to compare the societal harm caused by other crimes. Between 1999 and 2020, 538,000 Americans died during the period referred to as the opioid crisis. Forbes estimated the economic toll of the opioid epidemic being over . The crisis was triggered by the aggressive promotion of a prescription painkiller called OxyContin launched by Purdue Pharma in 1996. By 2004, OxyContin had become the leading drug of abuse in the U.S.  Purdue Pharma was owned by the Sackler family, who had a dominant presence on the company’s board. Despite contesting their liability for years, in 2020, Purdue Pharma finally  to bribing doctors to needlessly prescribe OxyContin, lying to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and paying illegal kickbacks for the purposes of promoting opioid prescribing to physicians. Purdue Pharma aggressively marketed OxyContin, while critically underplaying its addictive nature, its failure to achieve marketed pain-relief claims and pushing clinicians to administer dangerously high doses. The painkiller has 10 or 20 times the narcotic content of many regular painkillers and is 50% stronger than morphine. A Los Angeles Times, “OxyContin is a chemical cousin of heroin, and when it doesn’t last, patients can experience excruciating symptoms of withdrawal, including an intense craving for the drug.” Time and again, it turned normal Americans into addicts, who then turned to other drugs (such as heroin and synthetic fentanyl) when their pain relief was intolerable, their prescriptions stopped and/or their addictions spiraled out of control. Purdue Pharma knew this, and yet they continued to market the drug — hard.  Purdue Pharma was assisted by McKinsey, the management consulting firm. According to a lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General,  how to “turbocharge” sales of OxyContin, how to counter efforts by drug enforcement agents to reduce opioid use and was part of a team that looked at how “to counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed on the drug.” There have been numerous court cases over OxyContin, resulting in fines, bankruptcy and the closure of the firm. There are legal battles over whether the Sackler family should be held personally liable in civil and criminal courts. Yet, nobody from Purdue Pharma has received a prison sentence over their involvement.  In 2020, activists and journalists uncovered a 2007 Department of Justice memo that had recommended felony charges against senior Purdue Pharma executives on the basis that they started the conspiracy in 1992, knew about OxyContin’s abuse problems within months of its 1996 launch, lied to Congress and were continuing in the conspiracy. The charges could have resulted in prison sentences. However, the DoJ decided not to file such charges at the time, because, as author Gerald Posner  DoJ officials were concerned that “Purdue’s large, well-funded legal team might well overwhelm [the Department of Justice’s] small group of prosecutors.”  And there’s the rub. Justice that seeks to account for comparable harm is compromised by the wealth and power of those being brought to justice. This is maybe why only one person in the U.S. was jailed —  — as a result of the Global Financial Crisis, despite the fact that it has left lasting scars across the U.S. and the world. A 2018 study by the Federal Reserve found the crisis cost every single American approximately $70,000 — and the social impacts have been more damaging. A U.K. government body , “The implications of the crisis on poverty, employment and political stability are worrying.” This is maybe why nobody has been held to account for taking the U.S. and U.K. to war with Iraq in 2003 on the basis of a lie, despite it resulting in approximately 200,000 civilian deaths, tens of thousands of military deaths, the displacement of millions, stability issues across the Middle East, and as , maybe the Global Financial Crisis itself. This is maybe why Exxon hasn’t been called to account for hiding the fact they knew the  over 40 years ago, but instead of raising the alarm, they spent millions promoting misinformation, while the issue increasingly seems like it’s getting out of control.  Justice delayed is justice denied. But with the above cases, it’s not clear that justice will ever be served. At the same time, in a prison in Tucson, Arizona, Ross Ulbricht is being held without even the faint glimmer of hope that he will even be allowed to contest his incarceration, let alone secure any type of freedom. This isn’t whataboutism, this isn’t an attempt to confuse the issue, to muddy the waters such that Ulbricht is made out to be a heroic victim. This is merely to show that a flawed young man, who sought to test the limits of government controls on personal freedoms, is being held to the highest account, while those who seek to use their power and influence to inflict uncalled-for harm on significant proportions of society are allowed to walk freely among us.  Civilizations throughout time and across geographies and cultures have established approaches to drugs that are vastly different to the ones governments impose now. The current paradigm is neither faultless nor permanent. Laws and rules are always being tested by innovation and pugnacious individuals looking to account for changing attitudes outside of the guardrails of laws. There are risks and benefits to these approaches, just as there are risks and benefits to maintaining the status quo. Nevertheless, irrespective of the merits of reappraising the legal approach to drug use, laws were broken and a judgment was made. The rule of law demands that all people are held accountable. As Theodore Roosevelt said, “No man is above the law.” It was therefore a reasonable expectation that a just punishment would be required, just as it is reasonable to demand that justice be applied equally throughout society irrespective of power and influence. It is also a widely held principle that the enforcement of laws should be fair. In this regard, it is reasonable to declare that a life sentence contravenes , “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”  Ross Ulbricht should not die in prison, especially when many powerful criminals live free.

"21",618,2022-10-04,"Decrypt","Skyweaver game developer Horizon just raised a Series A round with a pair of Web3-friendly video game giants onboard.  Major video game publishers Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive are digging deeper into the  gaming space with today’s announcement of  raised by Horizon, the developer behind NFT-driven competitive card game, .  The two firms are among those that participated in the funding round, which was led by Brevan Howard Digital and Morgan Creek Digital. Other backers include , gaming-centric VC firm Bitkraft, metaverse investor , payments firm Xsolla, and Initialized Capital.  Horizon also attracted some notable individual investors with the round, including Shopify CEO Tobias Lütke, , and a pair of co-creators from notable NFT games:  co-founder and COO Sebastien Borget and  co-founder and Sky Mavis COO Aleksander Larsen.    Skyweaver is a digital trading card game akin to Blizzard’s popular , albeit with the cards represented as  NFT assets that can be sold and traded—similar to rival NFT game . An NFT is a blockchain  that represents ownership in a unique item, including digital goods like artwork, collectibles, and video game items.  Horizon’s title first launched in closed alpha testing in 2018, but only released into open beta earlier this year for anyone to play. In addition to publishing the game, Horizon has turned the tech behind it into , an Ethereum-based development platform and  for other creators to tap to create their own  games and apps.  In a post today, Horizon wrote that it will use the $40 million to further push Sequence, as well as continue to enhance and grow Skyweaver. It will also soon launch , a decentralized marketplace focused on Ethereum and Polygon ERC-1155 NFTs—also called semi-fungible tokens (SFTs)—used for games and collectibles.  Horizon previously raised $13.3 million in seed funding, including  in 2020 led by Initialized and its now-departed co-founder, Alexis Ohanian. The Reddit co-founder has been an outspoken advocate for Skyweaver and NFT gaming on the whole,  that it was a “non-obvious investment” at the time.  Ubisoft and Take-Two Interactive are two of the largest video game publishers around. Ubisoft is the firm behind massive franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Just Dance, and Far Cry, while Take-Two’s popular brands like Rockstar Games and 2K Games have produced smashes like Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and NBA 2K.  Both have also made previous moves into the Web3 space. Ubisoft has , and more recently stepped up its efforts by  for the PC game Ghost Recon Breakpoint in December 2021. The firm has also invested in and supported numerous other Web3 startups.    Take-Two, meanwhile, recently acquired mobile and casual game maker Zynga, which is currently working on NFT-driven games. In January, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the horizon, which he said the combined company would be better positioned to tackle.  Many gamers have  citing scams, rampant speculation, and the  of top platform Ethereum. However, many in the Web3 space—from  to  —believe that NFTs will eventually take hold in the video game industry due to prospective benefits for players and creators alike."
"22",776,2022-10-04,"CryptoDaily","Tesla has arguably done more for environmentalism than most green projects put together. By making the best cars not be gas guzzlers, they dramatically changed the environmental outlook for the entire auto industry, and aligned consumers' interest in amazing products with society’s long-term interests. Web3 would do well to take note.  Car buyers have always been interested in having the sleekest design, shiniest leather seats, flashiest rims, and fastest vehicle. By building a car that actually competes on those specs rather than another version of the Prius, Tesla has leaned into an already existing incentive structure in the car industry, and thereby made the company a tremendous force for good. Some companies in blockchain entertainment have taken a leaf out of the Musk playbook, and are leaning into already existing consumer desires to create attractive products.  Ever since the likes of Axie Infinity and Spielworks’s Womplay platform helped pioneer play-to-earn gaming a few short years ago, the industry has been clamoring to expand on the idea that cryptocurrencies can fuel a new kind of gaming that empowers users to actually earn and spend digital currency. The play-to-earn industry even went through a fad of many companies changing the term to play-and-earn, to emphasize tokenomics shouldn’t come at the expense of gameplay.  A great example is Anomura, which has introduced a play-to-donate model. Players have the choice to allocate in-game rewards towards wildlife conservation. This ups the ante from projects working to be carbon neutral, to actually empowering players themselves to do environmental good. This kind of project can transform the P2E industries through in-game social impact initiatives, but only if the game truly catches the masses.  Indeed, the blockchain ecosystem is well-positioned to follow the Tesla approach of leaning into consumers because the entire point of most blockchain initiatives is to do so. And this goes beyond finance via DeFi, or art via NFTs. Even in sports, there is a way to expand into new markets, as LEAP zeros in on talented young athletes. With its TikTok-like interface, the platform leverages crypto tokenomics to empower young, undiscovered athletes to showcase their skills and gain support from talent seekers. The kids are already spending their time on Social Media, but in this case they support their growth and career instead of just gameplay for the sake of fun—leaning into the target market for the target market’s advantage.  Just like Tesla transformed auto, so did Spotify and Apple music change the music industry not long ago. Consumers used to purchase an album for a pretty penny, but now they enjoy huge catalogs from a small monthly subscription. Still music fans are just passively consuming, and the rewards of the industry are reserved for a small group of elite talent.  Now, music companies move past just minting NFT’s off of album art. Instead, they use blockchain to create an opportunity to lean into music consumers desire to be active participants in the industry.  One example is Gala Music, a blockchain-based music streaming platform that provides fans with unique opportunities to enrich their experiences. Rather than a centralized structure where a platform itself would hold all the music and control access to it, every listen on Gala Music comes from an NFT track hosted on a Player Node or Fan Node within the platform. Listeners can become the providers of essential infrastructure for worldwide music broadcast, and reap handsome rewards from it.  Don’t shove the blockchain down someone's throat  Making a killer product but incorporating a blockchain framework in a seamless way is easier said than done, but it truly is imperative. If blockchain companies try to sell by just focusing on blockchain’s added value, like transparency, decentralization etc. they are missing the forest for the trees. The focus must be on making products the best they can be, but they just happen to incorporate blockchain.  It is understandable from a branding perspective that companies try to lean into the blockchain identity, and that’s fair. But if the industry is going to actually take wings, companies need to restrain themselves. A user should be able to use a game or a platform, with a simple and attractive interface, and scarcely notice that they’re in the Web3 space. This way Web3 will reach mass adoption by its own volition.  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

"23",590,2022-10-03,"Cryptonews.com","Cardano  seems slightly bearish as the coin has reached a triple bottom level of $0.4150 and has formed a descending triangle pattern. After completing yet another significant upgrade,  is operating flawlessly once again. The Cardano team has always tried to enhance the network and its users' overall experience.  However, the episode was quite the opposite of what the community expected, as people thought ADA's price would surge after the hard fork, but eventually, it was under selling pressure.  During the weekend, Cardano was in bearish mode, having difficulty recording encouraging gains after the much-anticipated Vasil hard fork that was pushed earlier in September.  Curiously, Cardano developers have just released yet another update, koios-go-client v2.0.0. Positive environmental changes aside, ADA's indicators pointed to gloomy times ahead.  Charles Hoskinson, ADA is Entering New Era  Charles Hoskinson, maintaining his custom, used Twitter to inform his fans of forthcoming developments. The creator of Cardano has recently declared a new epoch for the network. His proposed ""Age of Voltaire"" could help spread network decentralization.  Hoskinson's tweet says this new era is geared toward the people who create and use networks. He argues that Cardano aspires to develop decentralized governance in a manner that 'shows' the remainder of the space how to do it right.  Facing Down Rivals  Cardano has taken a lot of flak in the crypto community since many traders and investors think the network is not expanding quickly enough. In the most recent instance, Ethereum guru Evan Van Ness referred to the blockchain as a ""zombie chain.""  Van Ness noted, despite Uniswap's far smaller market price, it experienced more transactions than Cardano. These aren't the ideal projects to use as an example because of the vast differences in how they operate and generate revenue.  But in terms of decentralized financial activity, Cardano is behind other networks. Hence, this criticism adds downward pressure on Cardano's price.  Cardano Price Review & Tokenomics  At the time of writing, Cardano's current price is $0.4267, with a 24-hour trading volume of $478,371,258. Cardano has fallen by 0.25% in the last 24 hours and 3.84% in seven days.  CoinMarketCap currently ranks #8 with a live market cap of $14,618,490,093. It has a total supply of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins and a circulating supply of 34,253,127,048 ADA coins.  Cardano Price Prediction  The ADA/USD has formed a descending triangle pattern, extending support near the $0.4181 level. Because descending triangles are likely to break on the lower side, it's critical to keep an eye on the $0.4181 level.  A break below this level can cause downward pressure, leading the ADA price to an immediate support level of $0.3675. Alternatively, if the ADA/USD coin remains above $0.4180, the triple bottom support level may continue to rise towards $0.4850.  On the daily timeframe, a downward trendline at $0.4850 may obstruct Cardano's upward movement. However, increased demand for Cardano could cut through this level and extend the uptrend until $0.5275 or $0.5835.  Leading technical indicators like the RSI and MACD remain below 50 and 0, respectively, indicating a bearish trend in Cardano. The 50-day moving average, on the other hand, is likely to keep the ADA price below $0.4600.  As a result, reaching $1 will be a significant challenge for Cardano."
"24",671,2022-10-01,"Decrypt","The Web3 brand's vibe is ""punk rock meets hyperfemininity,"" tapping NFTs that can be redeemed for apparel and other products.    Most people today likely first associate  s with digital-only items like profile pictures, artwork, and collectibles. But blockchain tokens can also be tied to physical art, property, and other tangible assets.  In one provocative example of how NFTs could shake up retail and apparel, PussyDAO aims to use  NFTs as redemption coupons to purchase things like underwear and streetwear.  Founder and CEO Izzy Howell, formerly head of growth at Solana derivatives protocol ,  at this week’s Chainlink SmartCon conference that the idea came to her while chatting with her former  colleagues.  “I was up really late with my team, and all of the guys on my team just kept saying liquidity is all that matters. ‘That's the most important thing: liquidity, liquidity, liquidity,’” she recalled. “And the next thought in my head was that I wanted to make a pair of panties that said ‘highly liquid’ on the crotch.”  Howell—previously  by Decrypt—shared her idea with others and said she “got lots of support from the crypto industry"" (including funding) so she left Cypher to focus on the new venture. PussyDAO will start off by offering NFTs that can be redeemed at any time for the physical underwear, but she has larger ambitions for the brand over time.    “We’re using Web3 tech to scale the next generation of apparel, CPG [consumer packaged goods] products, software drops, and experiences,” Howell told Decrypt in a followup chat via Telegram. “Our brand is punk rock meets hyperfemininity: we’re gritty, girly, and powerful—and a much-needed breath of fresh air in this bro-centric space.”  Howell’s plan is to expand the PussyDAO brand into “anything that’s super hype-y,” including the aforementioned products and experiences.  The idea of redeeming a blockchain token for physical apparel isn’t new, and it’s been explored in various ways. Unisocks, for example, is a project that , and the price of each token rises with each sale on a bonding curve—it started at $12, but now .  Adidas explored the model of NFTs redeemable for exclusive apparel with  in partnership with , NFT influencer gmoney, and the Punks Comics project. And the  blockchain’s  is built around tokens that can be redeemed for physical goods.  Howell said that redemption NFTs make sense for streetwear and other goods because it’s easier to resell digital tokens than be forced to physically ship things to buyers. Swapping tokens could be cheaper, easier, and have less of an environmental impact than shipping packages, too.    “People buy [streetwear] in an instant, and then it's the buyer's responsibility to take that hat and post it themselves on eBay, and they have to deal with the shipping and all that stuff,” she explained. “But if I just own the NFT that entitles me to that physical object, it's much more frictionless for me as someone who's selling it on a secondary market.”  Howell is launching on Solana because she was “raised by the Solana ecosystem,” but she envisions a multi-chain future and plans to debut products on other blockchain platforms.  As PussyDAO charts a course towards its first product launch, Howell describes a brand that’s uniquely Web3. “This is the first investor-backed social commentary,” she told Decrypt. “Not only are we a company—we’re also a living, breathing art movement. We drop products that are designed to incite meaningful conversations around gender, identity, and the financial landscape.”"
"25",1106,2022-10-01,"Cryptonews.com","Marc Piano, Senior Associate at global offshore law firm Harneys, is a member of the Investment Funds, Corporate, and Banking & Finance teams in the Cayman Islands office. Phil Graham, Partner at Harneys, is global head of the Investment Funds and Regulatory groups and head of the transactional team in the British Virgin Islands.  __________  The buzz around a virtual asset or  project will typically focus on the ‘front-end’ – the product offering, team, partnerships, and performance; how it is going to change the world. Whilst accepting that the corporate structuring behind the front-end is far less exciting, it truly can make the difference between a project’s success and sustainability or its failure and damaging fallout.  Many web3 projects aspire to decentralisation, but initially consist of a small and highly centralised team. Like any early-stage start-up, a crypto project will usually want to set up a corporate structure to protect the project’s team and its assets, secure funding, and start doing business with real-world counterparties.  Similar considerations will also apply to principals wanting to set up a cryptoasset-focused fund, who will want to seek and provide for attractive returns, have an optimised  structure and, be appealing to an investor base all over the world, whilst protecting the investment management vehicle and the fund’s other service providers by using a flexible and appropriately regulated structure for their launch.  With that in mind, international financial centres (IFCs), such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Cayman Islands provide attractive solutions for both crypto projects and crypto funds.  For decades IFCs have offered tax-neutral and appropriately regulated financial services products to their users through sophisticated and experienced financial services providers. For example, many investment funds and other financial services products are domiciled in IFCs, including the vast majority of the world’s crypto funds: an  63% of which utilise Cayman Islands and BVI vehicles.  One shining example of innovation by IFCs to create vehicles for specific uses is the Cayman Islands foundation company. Foundation companies are not required to have charitable or non-profit purposes and unlike most corporate vehicles, are not required to have members in order to remain in existence. These two factors make foundation companies attractive to projects aiming for decentralisation as they can serve as a memberless vehicle with the sole purpose of supporting the project or its governance protocol. The foundation company can engage with third parties or hold certain assets in support of the project and can be bound by its constitutional documents to act on the instructions of a governance protocol or its representatives.  In addition, virtual asset regulations in the BVI and the Cayman Islands allow BVI or Cayman Islands entities to be used as the token issuer, with private sales being largely unregulated and public sales of tokens being subject to appropriate levels of regulatory oversight.  A structure that is frequently used involves establishing a Cayman Islands foundation company, which owns a token issuing vehicle, typically formed in the BVI. The director(s) of these companies will often be a professional services provider, who can take guidance from the governance protocol adopted by the decentralised autonomous organisation (  ). This approach separates each entity’s functions appropriately as well as reducing some risk and simplifying accounting for the project and team. For many projects, this can enhance decentralisation governance and further remove the founders and team from the corporate structure that will carry out activities.  All of this being said, there is no one size fits all approach to crypto fund or crypto project structuring. Each team must carefully consider their commercial requirements, risk appetite, and legal, regulatory, and tax position.  Slavishly copying a structure used by other projects is a dangerous game particularly without understanding that project’s objectives, legal and tax advice, and risk appetite in a shifting regulatory landscape.  Engaging crypto-experienced service providers early in the process means a fund or project can get the right advice early enough to avoid costly mistakes to understand fully their legal and regulatory position, the tax implications of a proposed structure (both for founders, users, and the project vehicles themselves), reduce risk where possible, and avoid consequences which may arise well after a fund or project is launched that could be difficult or impossible to remedy.  In addition to choosing the right structure, the global regulatory landscape crypto is in flux. The Financial Action Task Force (  )– the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog – published anti-money laundering standards and recommendations for certain crypto businesses which jurisdictions must implement locally to avoid being subject to sanctions such as blacklisting. Not all crypto businesses will be affected in the same way by new crypto regulations and, of course, other laws and regulations, such as securities, investments, banking, substance, and data protection legislation may apply to a project, so a local legal and regulatory analysis may be required for each vehicle in a structure.  In this context, it is incredibly important for readers to realise that using a vehicle domiciled in an IFC won’t absolve crypto projects of their obligations to comply with the relevant laws and regulations in countries in which they do business or in which their clients or customers are based, especially given the fact that a large number of the digital asset projects often involve a mixture of IFC vehicles and vehicles domiciled onshore.  Crypto continues to grow and thrive regardless of market setbacks and downturns. Many of the world’s largest crypto funds and businesses use IFC vehicles to optimise their corporate structure, and startup projects with the right advice can also benefit from the jurisdictional and structuring advantages offered by IFCs and their corporate vehicles.  IFC jurisdictions recognise the value of crypto in strengthening their global offering, so local governments and regulators regularly consult with industry to understand trends and implement frameworks to position themselves to capture crypto market share while complying with international standards around corporate and tax transparency and reporting.  This agility is difficult to find in onshore jurisdictions and helps IFCs maintain their reputation as preferred jurisdictions for businesses with a global client base, to the point where some projects have opted to have physical offices and staff on the ground itself. The physical benefits of residing in these jurisdictions are for an entirely separate publication, but there is no doubt that there is a perfectly aligned approach on both islands, which means that both the BVI and Cayman Islands should always be firmly in the mind of anyone operating in this space.  ____"
"26",3045,2022-10-01,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Frank Nuessle, previously a T.V. executive, university professor and publishing entrepreneur.  ""A good community insures itself by trust, by good faith and good will, by mutual help. A good community, in other words, is a good local economy."" — , Work of Local Culture  As the Canadian entrepreneur  has opined - Bitcoin is the “bridge to the other side.”  In this article I argue that to cross that bridge, the American Bitcoin Economy would best be structured as a network of interconnected city-centered economies, all using Bitcoin and all competing with each other.  The complexity of designing such a decentralized, highly networked money system to operate alongside the current highly centralized fiat money system is mind-boggling, almost overwhelming. Thinking about it makes my head hurt. It is like trying to change all four tires on a Land Rover racing along at 80 miles an hour. Yet that is the task at hand.  As a guy from the hinterlands, I have been ruminating on fiat money since Nixon took America off the gold standard in 1971, and I’ve been studying money systems seriously for 20 years — not long ago as a professor in the organizational dynamics department at the University of Pennsylvania, where I taught graduate courses in sustainability. Today I consider myself a social system architect and a Bitcoin maximalist. But I digress.  Cities have been at the center of America's economic progress starting not long after  discovered Manhattan in 1609.  By 1641 Manhattan had become America’s economic hub around which the circle of Atlantic trade turned.  At first Manhattan was controlled by , which is why Manhattan developed an intensively active merchant class — everyone wanting to buy, sell, grow and spend, while also becoming one of the most multicultural places on earth.  Because it was founded on the principles of free-market capitalism, Manhattan offered an unprecedented opportunity for advancement. Upward mobility became an inherent part of American culture, while at the same time, planting the dream of economic freedom throughout the world.  Today that American dream of a free and fair chance for all has been severely tarnished.  American cities are no longer the center of a vibrant, free-market economy but instead are plagued with escalating violence, congested gridlock, unmanageable homelessness, essential worker displacement, housing shortages, rent escalation and deteriorating infrastructure.  The root problem is that America’s current corporate-capitalist economy is being run as a corporate oligarchy, supported by a fiat money cartel that funnels money to the already rich, instead of as a critically-thinking free-enterprise democracy.   once observed that America doesn’t solve its problems; it leaves them behind.  America needs to leave behind the futile attempts to resurrect an industrial/consumer economy of perpetual growth fueled by fiat money.  Our current economic narrative pits jobs and the ability of the middle class to earn a living against the environment. This mind-set of perpetuating infinite economic growth to feed an already rich elite, a shrinking middle class and a desperate citizen under-class will only produce mutually assured destruction.  As , author of “The Black Swan,” stated in Bloomberg Businessweek:  “We’re not living in capitalism. We’re not living in socialism. We’re living in some weird economic situation with the banks controlling more of their share. It’s like we’re serving them rather than them serving us.”  America needs to evolve a new form of sound money capitalism that values social equity along with human and planetary well-being because oligarchic capitalism does not recognize these as critical components of long-term societal and economic health.  In short, what America needs is a coherent new economic narrative that paints a picture of a viable and prosperous future, an economic model I call ""distributed capitalism,” a term coined by .  Rifkin sees distributed capitalism as the centerpiece of a third Industrial Revolution in which a new social vision unfolds with power broadly distributed, “encouraging unprecedented new levels of collaboration among peoples”.  A distributed free-enterprise economy consists of many interconnected free-enterprise networks and is the most complex and creatively dynamic system on the planet.  No other economic operating system comes close to providing the shared societal benefits of a truly competitive marketplace.  Here are five reasons why centering the evolution of the American Bitcoin Economy around a network of interconnected city-centered economies (all using BTC, and all competing with each other) will allow for the fulfillment of Rifkin’s vision of a third Industrial Revolution. Think of it as the flowering of Web 3.0.  Cities Have Historically Driven Economic Prosperity  It was the cities of Italy, Florence, Milan and particularly Venice that initiated the economic renaissance of Europe in the 13th century after the profound decline in trade which began in the eighth century with the abandonment of gold coinage.  As  has written about in his book “  ” that city, like Manhattan in the 17th century, developed a system of justice providing impartial protection for both the rich and the poor where the mercantile class were treated fairly. “Even the word ‘bank,’ in the financial sense, originates in Venice, from the banca or ‘benches’ of moneychangers by the Rialto Bridge.”  This was the beginning of a new social and political order, labeled as the Renaissance, that emerged out of centuries of feudalism, all created out of trade and capital formation based on sound money.  As the centuries rolled by, the dominant city trade centers changed from empire to empire — Barcelona for the Spanish, Amsterdam for the Dutch, London for the English and then Manhattan for America.  With Sound Money, Cities Will Drive Sustainability  In her 1969 book, “The Economy of Cities”  argued that the primary driver of economic development was cities. Her main point was that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement or the process of producing goods locally that formally were imported. Jacobs believed that population density was necessary for entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor.  With the increasing level of global warming disruptions coupled with the critical need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, it should be obvious that producing goods locally and accelerating import replacement will be important objectives of the bitcoin economy.  Why would a sound money, distributed free-enterprise economy drive import replacement?  The term ""distributed free-enterprise"" is really just a vast network of cities, rural outposts and communities of all sizes where business and government work together for the betterment of all citizens, fueled by the creative energies of citizens who exchange value and culture in an open, transparent way.  This economic model fosters more individual creativity and innovation, and more ways of doing things than in an economy with the uniformity and rigidity of a command-and-control corporate structure.  If cities were able to control their own money systems, one outcome would be a notable shift in the configuration of power. Local residents would be less subject to the will of far-off centers of power. Local businesses would be able through import substitution to produce goods and services locally and then sell them wherever they wanted.  The end result would be a wider diversity of locally produced products and services with greater resilience and adaptability to change in our unpredictable future of potential economic and severe climate change disruptions.  Place-Based Sound Money Aligns With Human Nature  As  in his book, “Living in a World that Cannot be Fixed,” writes, “Human cultures are about place: where to live, and home: how to live and with whom.” With social media, place has increasingly become an abstraction with confusing effects on human nature. A new grounding can occur in cities with place-based sound money.  One of the most unsung heroes in the study of honest money and human nature was the author , an independent scholar who dedicated himself in the 1930s to understanding the exchange of value. His belief was that a simple, honest system for the exchange of value would do more to enhance the dignity and wellbeing of the common man than any political reform.  Riegel was a genius at understanding human nature and the functioning of money as a social system. He identified two important principles of human nature — self-preservation and self-advancement, along with a derivative third principle — the three-part free enterprise system.  Self-preservation is the first principle of human nature. Riegel believed that selfishness is “the sublime law of being.” But to be intelligently selfish, a person must win the respect and cooperation of his/her fellows which leads to the second principle — self advancement through cooperation.  Before a person can win cooperation, he/she must be able and willing to give it. Until a person has obtained a selfish level of cooperation with his/her fellows, no social order exists. Cooperation finds its expression in the free exchange of value. Fostering the free exchange of value is the engine for social and economic progress.  Riegel’s third principle was the three-part free enterprise system of specialization of labor, exchange of value, and competition. He saw honest competition as the sublime law of nature and the basis for a truly high functioning economic operating system fostered by sound money.  This system cannot be improved upon. Every human is the servant of every other human. This is the law of life. Either you serve life or its opposite.  Out of these principles, human civilization began its evolution in the early cities and continued throughout history in the world’s city centers.  Competition Within Cities And Between Cities Creates Resilience  Honest competition is the evolutionary search engine for humans, seeking fact-based truth at all costs.  As the evolutionary economist,  has shown, evolution is an algorithm; it is an all-purpose formula for innovation. It is a simple but profound three-step process: differentiate, select, amplify. Evolution is a search algorithm that finds needles of good design in haystacks of possibility.  In a sound money environment, the most intelligently selfish individual is the most socially minded, productive and creative. When transparency rules, those who will not deal fairly are defeated by competitors.  A centralized fiat money monoculture creates monopolies which destroy competition. Competition is indispensable to the successful operation of a monetary system.  Honest competition contains corruption and incentivizes innovation.  In nature there is a constant push–pull tension between two emergent properties: efficiency and resilience.  Efficiency requires scale — bigness. Today’s monetary monoculture has skewed the balance too much to efficiency, for example, forcing small local banks serving one city region to sell out to national conglomerates.  Resilience requires a network of relatively independent self-reliant cities, so that the failure of one does not imperil the entire system. Those cities best able to withstand future crises — whether pandemics, climate disruptions or financial meltdown — will be the ones that thrive economically by fostering internal prosperity and competing fairly with other cities.  Such resilient markets will also be the best place for investors to park their money. Such cities will attract the best and the brightest people. They will be the places where residents feel secure enough to innovate.  A City Economy Is A Local Living System  As the late Belgian physical chemist and Nobel laureate  observed, all living systems are dissipative structures ruled by the second law of thermodynamics. Living systems maintain their structure by the continuous flow of energy throughout the system.  This flow of energy keeps the system in a constant state of flux. Fluctuations feed off themselves. Amplification can easily overwhelm the whole system. That’s exactly what’s occurring today as civilization encounters global peak oil and ever increasing, disastrous, real-time climate change disasters.  When the fluctuations overwhelm a living system, it either collapses or reorganizes itself. A successful living system reorganization will exhibit a higher order of complexity and integration.  A city economy that is open and adaptive with interlocking networks that change organically can make sudden, creative leaps into novelty thus reorganizing itself into a higher order of complexity and integration.  The localization of the systems for the creation and distribution of sound money would foster free market capitalism on Main Street, where local, shared ownership and local decision-making bring to life economic activity in service of the whole community.  As  preaches, “Money is economic energy.”  The great economic revolutions in history have occurred when new energy regimes converge with communications revolutions. This convergence offers the opportunity to restructure, organize and help maintain the energy flow through the American economic system.  Bitcoin is the technological gift that can make this local economic living system transformation possible.  Saylor also believes that economic energy, like any energy, be it electricity or electromagnetic waves, must travel in a medium as a frequency. With Bitcoin as the monetary systems unit of account, when money flows into an asset, like real estate, its frequency slows and it becomes a store of value.  If money is to move rapidly it must maintain a higher frequency and become a currency. Currency is the medium used to move economic energy around.  Thus, the challenge becomes how to design a monetary social system, anchored on bitcoin, so that a network of city centered cryptocurrencies can maintain that higher circulatory frequency and stimulate local economic health and well-being.  The Challenge Ahead  In 1971,  proposed the fundamental insight that economic activity is about order creation, and that evolution is the mechanism by which order is created.  Building on that work, Eric Beinhocker in his book, “ ,” proposed that economic evolution is not a single process but rather the result of three interlinked processes — physical technology, social system technologies and business or system fitness.  Physical Technologies  Physical technology is what we are accustomed to think of as technology, things such as bronze making techniques, steam engines, microchips and more recently Bitcoin.  As  has written, “Bitcoin is a technology that will survive for the same reason the wheel, knife, phone or any type of technology survives. It offers its users benefits from using it. Bitcoin is a spontaneously emergent and autonomous system.”  The two technologies that I think most apply to the design of locally controlled, highly networked systems for the exchange of value are Bitcoin and AI information systems. Merge these two technologies into a transparent, city centered, highly networked information system and let this honest money exchange of value system loose into a city-centered free enterprise marketplace.  I believe Big Magic will happen.  Yet physical technologies are not enough without the other two legs of the stool — social system technologies and the right business/system design.  Social System Technologies  Social technologies are ways of organizing people to get work done that takes into account cultural norms. Physical technologies and social technologies co-evolve with each other. The relatively new organizational structure, , is a social technology as is social media and tools like Slack and Zoom.  What are the important social system technologies that need to be integrated into a sound money, city centered, highly networked and transparent system for the exchange of value? This is one of the central challenges in designing a local money system.  As  has written, “The technical challenges of transaction time, scaling and energy use have largely been solved. The socio-political questions have not, and here is the fertile soil for the cultivation of new forms of social accountability and new ways to infuse values into money.”  Eisenstein goes on, “The true nature of the human being — indeed, of being itself — is relationship. Only a system built upon that metaphysical understanding can hope to durably fulfill the hopes that we invest in it.”  To establish a money system by rational processes and through the voluntary cooperation of its users is without precedent. People do not want to understand money; they merely want to use it. This is consistent with their attitude toward all utilities.  Business Design/Fitness  For the physical and social technologies to have an impact on the world, someone must turn these technologies from concepts into reality, a working social system on Main Street.  Business design is how physical and social technologies are expressed in the world in the form of products and services.  Businesses are themselves a form of design, and the same can be said for a social system. The design of both encompasses its purpose, its strategy, its ownership, organizational structure, management processes, culture and a host of other factors. Business designs all go through a process of differentiation, selection and amplification, with the market as the ultimate arbiter of fitness.  This three-way evolution of physical technologies, social technologies and business/system design account for the patterns of change and growth in any economy.  Business/system fitness answers the question, “Can this system self-sustain?” A social system like money must be designed to pay its own way or be subsidized in some fashion.  Conclusion  The challenge we all face is how to reinvent America’s economic operating system so that the current version of “take make waste” capitalism doesn’t go down in flames and take the rest of us with it.  The American bitcoin revolution becomes a force when we allow ourselves to imagine that a new social system design might one day become a collective reality.  Said another way — perhaps the virtues of sound money may inspire a whole new, yet unseen world. Big Magic can happen!  As , the inventor of the helicopter, writes in his opus, “The Reflexive Universe”, ”Like the clam, man is buried in the sand with only a dim consciousness of the worlds beyond. Yet potentially he can evolve far beyond his present state; his destiny is unlimited.”  This journey has just begun.  This is a guest post by Frank Nuessle.

"27",609,2022-09-30,"Decrypt","Ernst & Young's global blockchain leader Paul Brody told Decrypt the company is ""all-in"" on public blockchains, particularly Ethereum.  At this year’s Messari Mainnet summit, Paul Brody, the blockchain lead at Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young (EY) told Decrypt that his company is “ .”  Recounting EY’s involvement in crypto, he reiterated how the firm was indeed one of the earliest adopters in the traditional finance world.  In 2015, EY formed a blockchain division to pursue work on public blockchains. Initially, it worked with private blockchains too, but that has “really decreased over the years,” Brody told Decrypt.    He elaborated: “Unlike anybody else, we’re actually building tools and applications in this space, so we built, for example, our own blockchain audit platform, where we can do on-chain and off-chain transaction reconciliation.”  EY’s in-house arsenal currently contains a  developed by its security team in Israel, a system called  which uses tokenization for traceability and transparency within supply chains, and a  Optimistic Layer 2 Rollup for affordable transaction privacy for enterprises.  This latter tool was donated into the public domain and refashioned into .  7 years of EY’s blockchain services  Brody chalked EY’s early adoption of crypto down to the fact that senior leadership was convinced of the power of blockchain technology. ""This will be the future path for most business-to-business transactions and we need to not just know a little bit about it,"" said Brody. ""We need to be all in.”  According to Brody, roughly 65% of EY’s work in blockchain revolves around audits.  The remaining slice is much broader and includes  tools, food traceability, and improving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors. Brody also said the company is building a carbon offset marketplace and carbon tracking tools.    “The pattern we see over and over again is that companies first want to dip their toe in with something that’s relatively easy. If you’re a bank that means maybe selling Bitcoin and to clients,"" he said. ""Over time they move up to more substantive activities: issuing assets, selling products and services, building  tools. I like to think of it as a slippery slope.”  The bear market and Ethereum  Finally, Brody spoke at length about how the current bear market affects EY’s blockchain division, adding that its clients in financial services do indeed care about the hefty price fluctuations. Still, he said, they see the volatility as ""a feature, not a bug.""  The industry clients are much different, however. Instead, ""they look at Ethereum as a public infrastructure for computing and business operations and what matters to them is the price of gas and the scalability of the network, not the price of the asset.”  Brody also said that EY has taken a “very hard line” against private blockchains and proprietary technology in spite of what clients may occasionally ask for.  This also makes the company especially bullish on Ethereum.  “We made a very strategic decision to only build on Ethereum. I have a limited engineering budget. I want us to be the best on earth at Ethereum—which is the largest market—not pretty good at 20 other things. The best on earth,"" said Brody. ""How long is it gonna take for my competition to adopt this strategy? I hope a really really long time. ”"
"28",585,2022-09-30,"CryptoDaily","Several cryptocurrencies have emerged and fallen in the crypto market over the last six months. This month, investors should watch Fantom (FTM), Algorand (ALGO), and Flasko. While Fantom (FTM) and Algorand (ALGO) have survived the market meltdown, Flasko has marched to the moon with its presale triumph. Flasko's worth has increased by 300% during its presale first stage.  Fantom (FTM) holders are interested in Flasko (FLSK) presale  Fantom (FTM) is one of the projects that have previously earned enormous profits for its investors. However, the current market slump devastated Fantom (FTM), trapping the project in a prolonged bearish period.  Fantom (FTM) is now trading at $0.2296. Even though Fantom (FTM) is 92.88% below its all-time high of $3.48, investors are optimistic that the project will recover because there are still many transactions on the platform. In 2019, the Fantom (FTM) platform was made public. Its goal was to enable rapid transactions at lower costs while maintaining high throughput.  The year 2021 was the best performance for Fantom (FTM), as the price increased from $0.01 to $3.48 in just over eight months.  Algorand (ALGO) investors found a new promising investment with Flasko (FLSK)  For several months, the development of Algorand (ALGO) has been a combination of red and green. Though market sentiment has improved in recent months, Algorand (ALGO) still has a lot of ground to cover. Algorand (ALGO) aspires to be a platform that provides speedier transactions by utilizing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism.  Algorand (ALGO) has recently announced a new version, Falcon, to enhance transaction volume on the platform and attract additional investors. The update intends to increase Algorand's (ALGO) usefulness and sustainability in the post-quantum computing age. Nevertheless, investors are still not confident of the project's viability, considering its recent losses.  Algorand (ALGO) was trading at $0.3144 at the time of writing, around 91% below its all-time high of $3.28.  Flasko (FLSK) presale attracts more investors  Using the Flasko alternative cryptocurrency, investors can buy NFTs backed by premium, rare and exclusive whisky, expensive champagne, and fine wine. Tis unique and one of a kind initiative is looking to change the way people invest in crypto allowing users to diversify their portfolios.  The current cost of the Flasko is $0.04 and likely will rise in the next 48 hours. Within two weeks of the presale beginning, more than 100 million tokens of the project's allotment has been sold, leading to analysts predicting a complete sell out. This has made it one of the most successful pre sales of 2022. Flasko may be able to provide investors with even higher profits, given the predicted 2,000% increase by 2023.  Companies can use the Flasko platform to promote and exhibit their top whiskey, wine, and champagne collections. Presale has already begun, and there is a significant demand for Flasko NFTs among consumers of pricey alcoholic beverages.  If you're looking for a cryptocurrency with significant long-term growth potential this year, consider investing in Flasko.

"29",2988,2022-09-30,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Seth Cantey, an associate professor of politics, and Mohammed Mourtaja, a Palestinian student studying international economics.  A debate is taking shape over whether bitcoin can play a role in Palestinians’ quest for freedom from Israeli occupation. It began a year ago, in September 2021, when Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation Alex Gladstein published “  ” on Bitcoin Magazine. The argument goes like this: Bitcoin allows users to securely send, receive and store value without reliance on any third party. In doing so, it enhances personal autonomy and serves as a form of resistance to occupation. In Gladstein’s words, “It is a peaceful protest, a digital shield, that could lead to big change.”  One of us authors has spent a lot of time down the bitcoin rabbit hole in recent years. The other, newer to bitcoin but well versed after months of intensive research on the topic, is Palestinian and until recently lived in Gaza. We address concerns about the need for caution and qualification in some of Gladstein’s arguments toward the end of this article, but in general we agree with him that bitcoin has the potential to play an important role in Palestine’s pursuit of freedom.  Not everyone does. Over the past year, knives have come out for this argument. That’s a good thing: More debate is needed on whether and how bitcoin can improve the lives of marginalized people, not less. But the quality of debate matters. Too often, analysts make points that are misinformed, usually a consequence of not putting in the work to understand a place or technology, and sometimes they misdirect readers to score points. A recent article includes both kinds of bad takes and is worthy of a considered response. In our critique below, we highlight the kinds of points that critics are getting wrong and try to model analysis that can be taken seriously by scholars, policymakers, and the general public.  A Critic Takes Aim  In July, Hadas Thier — a writer and activist published in The Nation and Jacobin among other outlets — responded to Gladstein in an article titled “ .” Writing for the Middle East Research and Information Project (MERIP), a non-profit independent research group, Thier acknowledges the “urgent and necessary pursuit of Palestinian financial independence,” which she characterizes as “indisputable.” But she argues that bitcoin should have no role in that pursuit. There is a “yawning chasm between the far-reaching promises made by Gladstein and others and the actual technological capabilities of cryptocurrencies,” she writes. These “faux-humanitarian promises” only offer Palestinians “dangerous economic and political risks.”  Those who have spent time in the space will already smell a problem. The title of Thier’s article refers to the role of bitcoin in Palestine, but she conflates bitcoin with cryptocurrencies throughout. The word “bitcoin” appears more than thirty times in the article, but some version of “crypto” appears just as often. Thier mostly uses crypto as an adjective: crypto adherents, proponents, enthusiasts, cheerleaders, millionaires, projects, assets, wallets, payments, entrepreneurs, transactions, exchanges, etc. Bitcoiners have long been at pains to distinguish between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; indeed, this is the raison d'être for the term “altcoin.” Bitcoin is the oldest, most decentralized, most secure and most widely adopted blockchain, one with a known and immutable monetary policy and a fixed supply. These characteristics meaningfully distinguish bitcoin from its competitors. To the extent that any nation-state has expressed even the prospect of adopting a digital currency not backed by a central bank, only one has been considered: bitcoin. In 2021,  crossed that Rubicon. Earlier this year, the  did the same.  Beyond injecting crypto into a conversation about bitcoin’s role in Palestine, much of Thier’s argument rests on criticisms that, she claims, make the asset unsuitable for adoption. Cryptocurrencies, she writes, are characterized by “wild volatility, inbuilt inequalities, environmental consequences and associations with criminal activity.” Assuming for a moment that she means bitcoin specifically (not cryptocurrencies generally), there is some truth in each of these allegations. On balance, though, they are unconvincing. Let’s go through each briefly.  First, it’s no surprise that an asset as small as bitcoin, which trades 24/7 in perhaps the world’s only truly free market, is . But volatility goes both ways. A dozen years ago the price of bitcoin was . Today it’s around $20,000. For the vast majority of the past decade and more, it has been a lucrative investment. While that doesn’t mean the future will look like the past, the word volatility need not be a pejorative. If we are watching the monetization of a new asset, a new money — and that may be exactly what we’re watching — then early adopters will benefit disproportionately. It shouldn’t be a surprise that developing countries, which tend to suffer more in the existing international financial system, are thinking harder about alternatives than developed ones.  Second, inbuilt inequality through pre-mines, pre-sales, etc. has been at the heart of nearly all cryptocurrency launches. That was not the case for bitcoin, however, which arguably had the  of any, and whose creator, as far as we know, has never profited. We recently heard it put this way: Satoshi Nakamoto was a buyer of bitcoin, not a seller. They purchased hardware and electricity to secure the bitcoin network, disappeared and have never touched the block rewards they received. And while it is true that some early investors in bitcoin profited immensely — this is typical of early investors in any successful technology — bitcoin wealth is becoming . That stands in contrast to wealth distribution trends generally. According to  from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, for example, the United States is currently in its “fourth straight decade of rising income and wealth inequality.”  Third, the purported environmental consequences of bitcoin are serious, well known and much discussed. They can also be . Anyone who says the protocol’s environmental footprint is insignificant or unimportant is wrong, but often critics begin with the assumption that any energy the protocol uses is wasted. In fact, all monetary systems use energy, including the petrodollar system. Citing data from the University of Cambridge, Lyn Alden notes that the bitcoin network currently accounts for . “In the very long run,” she writes, “if Bitcoin is wildly successful and becomes a systemically important asset and payment system used by over a billion people at 10-20x its current market capitalization, it should reach several tenths of one percent of global energy usage.” If it fails, on the other hand, “its energy usage will stagnate and shrink as the block subsidies continue to diminish.” Three questions, then, should be at the center of any discussion about bitcoin and the environment. First, is the energy dedicated to securing the network in pursuit of better money worth the environmental consequences, especially for the large part of humanity that desperately needs better money? Second, how do positive trends in renewable energy adoption within bitcoin mining affect that calculation? Third, could bitcoin meaningfully contribute to climate solutions over time, for example through  or the capture of ? We believe the answers to all three questions favor the continued exploration of this technology, including its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.  Finally, it is true that bitcoin has been associated with criminal activity, and that association will never go away entirely. The same can be said for the U.S. dollar. But the FBI isn’t worried about bitcoin. It worries instead about vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Citing data from Chainalysis, a recent  by the Bureau notes that of $1.3 billion in cryptocurrencies stolen from investors in the first quarter of this year, almost 97% was stolen from DeFi platforms. The percentage of activity on the bitcoin network associated with criminal activity, in contrast, is declining. According to a  by former acting CIA director Michael Morel, “The broad generalizations about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated.” Indeed, the transparent nature of public blockchains means they can even be useful to law enforcement. In Morel’s words, “Blockchain analysis is a highly effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.”  So Thier’s article seems to have been written without a grasp of differences between key technologies (i.e., bitcoin as a subset of, and not the same as, crypto) and without a sense of known rebuttals to common criticisms of bitcoin. Another kind of problem in her analysis is the straw man argument. On several occasions, Thier cites an interview she conducted with Sara Roy, a senior research scholar at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard and an authority on the Palestinian economy. She frames Roy’s comments both as contra-Gladstein’s argument and in support of her own. It may be that Roy doesn’t agree with Gladstein on bitcoin’s role in Palestine, and that she does agree with Thier, but that is impossible to know based on how Roy’s views are presented. Quoting Thier:  ""I spoke to Roy about Gladstein’s article. She strenuously disagreed with the notion that 'cryptocurrency is somehow impervious to the political reality in which Palestinians and Israelis reside' or that it could 'give dispossessed Palestinians parity with empowered Israelis, eliminating the gross asymmetries of power between them and granting Palestinians economic sovereignty.'""  Of course Roy disagreed with these notions. Even the most hardened bitcoin maximalist would. Gladstein did not write these things, has not said them and would not agree with them. The suggestion in Thier’s article is that she presented Gladstein’s argument to Roy, who forcefully objected to it. But the relevant quotation is not attributed to Gladstein for good reason; the thoughts aren’t his. This kind of analysis is either an unfortunate attempt to bolster an argument by misdirecting the reader or a gross misunderstanding of what bitcoin advocates believe the currency’s adoption in Palestine could achieve.  A final critique relates to a big topic, one squeezed into just two sentences in Thier’s analysis. “In a best-case scenario,” she writes, “some individuals from the Palestinian middle class — nearly non-existent in Gaza and struggling in the West Bank — could benefit from receiving international payments or remittances in bitcoin. But given the wild volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies, it will more likely harm those taking on the risk.” One of us has direct experience with remittances in Palestine and knows what it’s like to lose money to middlemen — be they banks, governments, or Western Union. A recent  shows that last year $3.5 billion dollars’ worth of remittances entered the West Bank and Gaza, accounting for 20% of Palestinian GPD. Unemployment in those territories hovers around 16% and 47%, respectively, and GDP per capita in Palestine overall is around . In other words, this affects everyone. When $1,000 turns into $920 because of transaction fees, or when $100 turns into $92, families and individuals who may earn the equivalent of only a few dollars per day feel those effects acutely. But only after a substantial delay. Transferring fiat to Gaza can take weeks.  Does bitcoin fix this? Maybe, and in the future it certainly could. If someone wants to send bitcoin to Gaza right now, they can do so with a smartphone. Via the Lightning Network, the transaction fee is essentially free. Almost immediately, that bitcoin will land in someone’s wallet on the ground. It can be transferred to Binance and converted to the stablecoin Tether (USDT) before being cashed out for Israeli Shekels at a currency exchange office. All of this can happen quickly — much faster than any fiat transfer — with minimal risk posed by volatility. In the future, if and when a company like  is operating in Palestine, fiat-to-fiat transfers across the bitcoin network could become common and replace the need for alternatives entirely.  Before shifting to our own critique of Gladstein’s argument, we want to acknowledge that Thier makes several points that we agree with. First, bitcoin is not a cure-all for the ills of Palestinians or any other people. Second, “The monetary relationship between Israel and the Palestinians reflects a more fundamental asymmetry of power.” Third, “An independent Palestinian economy will not arise magically out of a sovereign currency, digital or otherwise. It can only come about through the capacity to produce and trade goods and services, which has been systematically undermined through the destruction of physical infrastructure and the elimination of a geographical basis on which Palestinian capital accumulation could effectively take place.” These things are true. The question is whether informed bitcoin adoption has the potential to help Palestinians pursue economic freedom. We believe that it does and would encourage Thier to speak with those who have interacted with bitcoin in Palestine, as Gladstein and we have. Unfortunately, no Palestinians were interviewed for her article.  Getting The Debate Back On Track  This topic matters. Over the past dozen years, bitcoin’s market cap has grown exponentially, and the pace of cryptocurrency adoption — a majority or plurality of which has always been bitcoin — has exploded in developing countries in particular. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), which advocates for increased regulation of cryptocurrency to mitigate investment risks in the sector, notes in a  that 15 of the top 20 economies globally, in terms of digital currency ownership as a share of the population, are in emerging market and developing countries. In other words, the current global financial system is not working for many of the world’s poor, who are increasingly looking for alternatives.  Topics that matter generate debate, and Gladstein is to be commended for kicking this one off. He is a thoughtful analyst, his arguments hold up well to the criticism articulated in Their’s critique, and his work has attracted attention for good reason. He has also authored a  that explores the use of bitcoin by people throughout the developing world, among other topics, which we believe is well worth reading.  But we also want to sound a note of caution. Often analysts become advocates and, while that is not a problem per se, advocacy can undermine analysis. We have seen some of that in Gladstein’s work. In his book, for example, Gladstein draws on Greek history to paint bitcoin as a kind of Trojan Horse:  “Bitcoin will continue to gain worldwide adoption because of its effectiveness as digital gold, but hidden within the prized Trojan Horse is a remarkable freedom technology. At this point, the reader may think Bitcoin proponents must be saying, ‘Quiet in the back! Keep the noise down. We just need to last a few more hours until midnight, and then we can pop ourselves out of this horse and let the rest of our army into Troy.’ But it is already too late. There is nothing the Trojans can do.”  The analogy continues:  “Many authoritarians, central bankers, and establishmentarians may already realize what is concealed in Bitcoin’s Trojan Horse. There are plenty of modern Laocoöns and Cassandras saying, ‘We need to stop this thing!’ But, just like in the kingdoms of lore, these words will fall on deaf ears. The prize glitters too bright.”  The suggestion here is that bitcoin is inevitable, that the steady march to global adoption and the implications of that — both for “number go up” and “freedom go up” — are already baked into the cake. The truth is that that future is far from certain. Bitcoin continues to face a variety of risks, from the internal to the external to the local. Will a  develop over time to replace the block reward that has so far been essential to bitcoin’s security? What of the policymakers and regulators in the U.S. Congress and beyond, not to mention those in Europe, who seem determined to  out of existence? And in a place like Palestine, where electricity (and thus access to the internet) can be intermittent, and is mostly controlled by Israel, what would bootstrapping a resistance economy based on bitcoin really look like?  One can believe that bitcoin is freedom technology, that adoption will continue and that Palestine (and other places) will benefit from increased adoption over time. One can also believe that the ability to opt into a free and open, censorship-resistant monetary system offers Palestinians something important and in desperately short supply on the ground: dignity. The autonomy of choice in a context of occupation. And one can believe that Palestinian investments into bitcoin today will reap rewards over the long term. As it happens, we believe these things. But to argue that the game is already won, that widespread adoption of bitcoin in Palestine or elsewhere is inevitable, is to encourage uninformed adoption. People who accept and act on that argument are likely to take risks they don’t fully understand.  To his credit, Gladstein has also used more measured language when talking and writing about bitcoin and Palestine. Indeed, his article is framed as a question — “Can Bitcoin Be Palestine’s Currency of Freedom?” — rather than an answer. We agree with his suggestion that the answer could be yes, and hope to work alongside him and others to create the fair and just reality that Palestinians deserve.

On the , Magic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu told co-hosts Daniel Roberts and Stephen Graves that despite the skepticism from players, he believes that NFTs “unlock something completely new for gaming developers to build an economy and build a new business model on.”  Magic Eden has supported a wide array of NFT-based gaming projects through both its launchpad feature and secondary marketplace, including upcoming titles like , , and BR1: Battle Royale.

Lu admitted that there’s “so much to unpack” around gamers’ perceptions of NFTs, including the presence of bad actors in the industry and the increasing financialization of digital assets. Also, as a nascent space built around decentralized technology, it’s no surprise that many early NFT-powered games have been simplistic, falling short of some players’ expectations.

"34",1406,2022-09-26,"CryptoDaily","Web3 is the biggest innovation for the online community. From the Metaverse to play to earn and NFT games, web3 is a rapidly emerging force in the world of technology and companies like MetaBlaze are bringing age old storytelling to the new age web.  Web3 is a novel iteration of the World Wide Web, which integrates blockchain technology and crypto concepts like decentralization and token-based economics. Web 3.0 applications allow users to build, operate and own their creations. In essence, the goal of web3 is to give power to individuals rather than corporations.  Web3 is fast gaining an edge in the global arena, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a huge part of the change. NFTs started as aesthetically pleasing or intriguing art that people bought, sold, or held in a collection.  The progress in blockchain gaming has been very significant so far. Today, NFTs are a core part of crypto games like Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained, and Splinterlands. These blockchain games reward players with cryptocurrencies called GameFi tokens or NFT collectibles that can be used for several gaming activities.  Several crypto game models include play to earn NFT games like The Sandbox and move-to-earn like StepN. The next trend in the blockchain gaming industry is storytelling. Storytelling is an innovative feature that increases the user experience for gamers and helps build a thriving community.  This article explores how important and valuable storytelling is in blockchain games and how gaming crypto companies like MetaBlaze are leveraging it to further immerse its community, create virtual experiences, in addition to IRL events to further enhance the overall gaming experience, one that follows a narrative of epic proportions, potentially the first iconic story to have unfolded in the Web3 world.  Importance and Value of Storytelling in Web3  2021 was very favorable for NFT games. The NFT market surpassed $24.9 billion in trading volume in, an explosive growth compared to $95 million in 2020. The rise of web3 has given creators opportunities to create, own and sell their digital items to their community. As we approach the end of 2022 – Play to Earn is poised for tremendous growth as we transition into 2023.  In addition, another aspect of storytelling in Web3 involves providing the opportunity for collaborative narrative writing among a community. While this is popular in Web2 as fan fiction and YouTube creations, web3 takes it further by adding economic benefits in a scalable manner.  According to the co-founder and chairman of Animoca Brands, Yat Siu, Web3 allows content creators like artists, writers, designers, and others to collaborate with community members on various creative activities.  For example, Warner Bros. Entertainment launched a Batman NFT collection as a way to make Batman come to life for fans. Each NFT was designed to be a useful tool in creating the narrative for future DC comics. The NFT collection called the Bat Cowl Collection contains unique traits that allow fans to create unique looks in different worlds using their cowls. These newly created looks will now be used to create the stories behind the cowls.  It's hardly surprising that traditional web 2 companies are pushing hard into the web 3.0 space. Popular game company, GameStop, is a good example. Although recent figures have been underwhelming, GameStop NFTs are a big thing in the crypto games space.  Storytelling is helping web3 brands to empower both the creators and the community. Additionally, brand storytelling is important for companies to build an emotional connection with their customers. Let's see how MetaBlaze is building its ecosystem around storytelling.  How MetaBlaze is Leveraging Storytelling for Brand Awareness and Experience  What is MetaBlaze?

"35",1953,2022-09-26,"CryptoDaily","Extremely comprehensive legislative changes for the crypto sector are close to being implemented. Dusk Network is preparing for them, and in a series of articles on the subject, seeks to help the broader crypto community to understand its obligations in what can potentially be a difficult and complex transition into a new regulatory environment.  Dusk Network is a tip-of-the-spear project building a privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain from the ground up. At the same time as making ground-breaking advances in zero-knowledge technology, Dusk Network provides fully compliant smart contracts for businesses that need their privacy to be preserved.  Since early July of this year, Ryan King of Dusk Network has written and published a series of 5 articles aimed at breaking down the EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) regulation, which will have far-reaching implications for all crypto projects that wish to operate in the EU.  Key Terminology  The first article looks at how MiCA defines the various types of crypto assets, which can be confusing as they differ from what most in the industry understand them as.  There is no legal meaning to the word ‘stablecoin’ in the classifications, and this has been split into two categories: EMT (Electronic Money Token), and ART (Asset-Referenced Token). Neither algorithmically-backed tokens, nor security tokens, nor NFTs have been included in the classifications.  Who cares about MiCA?  In the second article Dusk Network looks at the various stakeholders as regards the MiCA regulation.  The European Union  The MiCA regulation takes into account the potential that stablecoins may have for inflationary effects on currency. Therefore MiCA includes strict clauses that oblige stablecoin issuers to ringfence their assets and have them frequently audited.  The article covers how there is potential for various scams and abuses in the crypto sector, and that when these take place investors look to their governments for protection and assistance, giving the EU the chance to step in and take enforcement actions under the incoming MiCA regulations.  It looks as if the EU is seeking to build a regulated and transparent ecosystem of crypto assets where companies can set up with the full knowledge that guidelines are clear across the whole 27 countries that make up the union.  The finance industry  The clear guidelines to be put in place with MiCA aim to allow TradFi and DeFi to co-mingle without any barriers, and in full compliance.  Dusk Network  A stated aim of Dusk Network is to give everyone full control over all their digital assets, so it recognises that MiCA can be a step in the right direction.  By building compliance in at the foundational level users will have the confidence that Dusk Network services can be accessed without having to worry if they meet regulations. With this in mind, Dusk Network will continue to observe MiCA and any other EU regulations with close attention.  What MiCA means for you  The third article in the series looks at the requirements for new crypto projects. The MiCA regulations are not retroactive and so will only apply to projects that are launched once the regulations are in place at some point in 2023.  The MiCA regulations want to make a project’s whitepaper a legally binding document. All relevant information needs to be in a whitepaper and any promises made within it are binding and have to be carried out or consequences will result.  There will also be rules for CASPs (Crypto Asset Service Providers) in that they must register a legal entity in any one of the 27 EU member states. They must show that they have enough funds in order to carry out planned operations; and they must demonstrate evidence of proper compliance.  Stablecoins are redefined  Although MiCA makes frequent reference to stablecoins, it does not legally define the word. Instead, two types of stablecoins are categorised, which are Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs) and Asset-referenced Tokens (ARTs).  The rules recognise that EMTs are a one-for-one equivalence, with one electronic euro having the same value as a physical euro. They must also be backed by only one fiat currency.  By contrast, an Asset-Referenced Token is denominated in a single currency, but is backed by any combination of two or more fiat currencies, one or more cryptocurrencies, and/or one or more other assets.  Right of redemption  Within the MiCA regulations but stemming from the 2014 EU Consumer Rights Directive, is the right of redemption after sale, within a 2-week cooling off period. This gives the right to a full refund without any valid reason, as long as funds are returned in their original form. This law will apply equally to both EMTs, ARTs, and any crypto assets.  The issue for a project wishing to raise funds for its launch is that potentially a significant amount of its coins could be returned within two weeks of the token sale.  This could mean that stablecoin issuances might only be attractive to large institutions that already have a lot of capital and who don’t need to raise funds in order to build.  Will the MiCA rules on stablecoins be too restrictive?  The EU appears to be concerned that stablecoins could threaten its control of the money supply, but it seems to be trying to balance this with the desire not to totally suppress the undoubted beneficial innovations that come with stablecoins.  Also, with the rule that interest cannot be paid to consumers on their stablecoin holdings, this takes away one of their utilities and could eventually lead to them putting their money into the bank instead, which is of course exactly what governments are after.  And finally, there is to be a $200 million euro cap on daily stablecoin transactions. At first glance this might seem a high limit, but in practice it isn’t. Many of the stablecoins operating today exceed this amount many times over.  The good, the bad, the ugly, and the unknown  The good  It does appear that the EU is genuinely trying to strike a balance between providing a clearly regulated environment for crypto assets while at the same time attempting to still allow for innovation to happen.  Regulatory clarity would hopefully attract those risk-averse sectors such as finance to come and set up in the EU, therefore, helping the European economy to compete with the United States and Asia as a place in which to do business based on DLT and other innovative technologies.  The bad  Regulatory compliance is a good thing, but it may be seen that the cost involved here could be prohibitive. Just the legal costs of writing a whitepaper could be great. Lawyers would have to comb through every word given that it would need to be a legally binding document.  Also, while not just involving huge costs for a project, it also greatly increases the chances that it might be taken to court, with the ensuing costs of litigation to be added to the bill, and possible fines or worse to be faced.  With the 2-week redemption period there is the possibility that potential attacks on social media attempting to put would-be investors off, will mean that no project can consider its fund raise safe until the 2-week period has ended.  MiCA provides a loophole for the 2-week redemption period if a company is able to get its token listed on an exchange. However, this can have the effect of giving a lot more power back to the exchanges, which might do creative deals with projects that will allow them to list quickly.  The ugly  Two odd exemptions from the MiCA specified categories are those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although they are covered by MiCA, they don’t fit into the EMT, ART, or utility categories, so they would likely have to fit into the catch-all ‘cryptocurrencies’ category.  The problem arises that bitcoin has no ‘issuer’, so a whitepaper can’t be written by it. However, the 30 June agreement gets around this by obliging the exchanges that list it to write the whitepaper themselves.  After writing the whitepaper they would then have to go through the same process for any project wishing to be accepted, and they would also assume the same liability and risks for everything written in the whitepaper, even though they did not create the crypto asset itself.  According to the Dusk Network view, a ‘grandfather’ rule might be expected to be applied, whereby a whitepaper wouldn’t be required of existing exchanges, but would be needed by any new exchanges, and also existing exchanges if they added these tokens after the rules came into effect.  Finally, an oversight by MiCA means that as the regulations come into effect and exchanges are required to obtain licences as CASPs, the current Anti-Money Laundering Directive 5 will still be in force, which requires fiat/crypto exchanges to have a licence for each EU state in which they operate.  Therefore, for the first 18 months after MiCA comes into force, crypto exchanges will need both national and EU licences which effectively doubles the amount of work for them.  The unknown  Even though the EU has been working on MiCA for 2 years, several key elements remain unaddressed. For example, although the rules for EMTs and ARTs are fairly well described, it does not appear that the utility token category contains enough specifics.  Issuers of utility tokens will still have to follow the same burdensome rules such as writing a whitepaper, but the possibility of additional rules for this category remains for the future.  On the subject of sustainability and energy usage, nothing concrete has been laid down, but this still leaves token issuers with a requirement to report their sustainability details without knowing if they will break any rules.  NFTs were not covered in the final draft of MiCA, and therefore it is not known if an amendment will be added or if entirely different regulations will cover them.  GDPR was also not covered in the final draft, therefore this is likely to be added as an amendment in the future. The issue regarding the publication of public addresses and the related metadata is one that Dusk Network is seeking to solve.  Algorithmic stablecoins is one further area that has not been comprehensively covered by MiCA. It does state that ‘algorithmic’ stablecoins are categorically not real stablecoins since they have no assets backing them.  But because of this, it would appear that they would fit into the ‘cryptocurrencies’ category and would require a whitepaper, but not a licence. They would also be able to be handled by CASPs and listed on exchanges. This would mean that an entire sub-category of stablecoins would not be under the same restrictions as other stablecoins which would seem to be very unreasonable and a source of frustration for projects working in this arena.  Final thoughts  MiCA looks to be quite restrictive and limiting for issuers and providers, adding to their work burdens and also to their risks of operating, which is likely to impact on the decentralised and revolutionary potential of the technology.  However, it could add the much needed regulatory clarity that will hopefully give the confidence to both innovators and consumers to enter and remain in the European crypto assets space.  If successful, other jurisdictions around the world could copy parts of the MiCA regulations, and therefore it could have an impact that goes far beyond European borders.

"36",482,2022-09-26,"Cryptonews.com","Much like the Ethereum Merge, the successful Cardano Vasil hard fork upgrade has not yet sparked significant gains in the days since it went live.  Both upgrades appear to have led to 'buy the rumor, sell the news' sentiment among investors, with gains seen in the days leading up to the events and selling pressure in the days following.   is down 3% in the last 24hrs and nearly 7% since its 7-day peak in the hours before the Vasil hard fork went live at 9.44pm UTC on September 22.  Cardano Reaches Price Inflection Point  ADA has now reached an inflection point that could see if pump up to more than $0.50 if the bulls can take control of the market - a more than 10% rally.  The fork was designed to make the blockchain more developer friendly and to encourage more projects to build there.  Vasil will bring more functionality, scalability and speed to the network and bullish analysts say it could push the price back over $1 and beyond.  Cardano recently passed 50 million transactions and handles an average of 50,000 per day and continues to , underpinning more than 1,000 projects.   has described it as ""the most important blockchain project in Africa right now"", given its continued development on the continent.  Cardano has partnerships with a number of African projects and governments to use their technology to help unbanked people access better financial services and develop agriculture.  Cardano Founder Expects TVL Boost  One continued criticism of Cardano is that its total value locked (TVL) lags way behind the biggest blockchains.  TVL is a formula that calculates the total value of all crypto assets locked in a DeFi protocol and is a key indicator in the value of both the blockchain itself and the projects built on it.  According to , Cardano is 27th on their list with just $80 million in TVL - many times smaller than the biggest projects such as  ($31.5 billion), Tron ($5.39 bn) and the Binance Smart Chain ($5.3 bn).  However, in an interview with  ahead of the Vasil hard fork, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said he is now expecting a major boost to TVL after the upgrade.  He said: “I think there'll be kind of a big spike within three to six months post-Vasil because there's a lot of people building who are waiting to deploy [new applications].”  Vasil will also introduce Plutus V2, Cardano's smart contract language, which will help create faster and more complex dApps on the blockchain.  Indeed, Cardano-based NFT project Artano has claimed they have seen a 93% decrease in transaction size and 75% decrease in overall cost while testing Plutus V2."
"37",350,2022-09-26,"Blockchain.News","Crypto mining firm Compute North has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a federal court.  The bitcoin mining hosting provider had been struggling to survive due to the decline in bitcoin pricing and rising power costs.  Compute North filed the petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on Thursday.  ""After any administrative expenses are paid, no funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors,"" the company claimed in the filing.  Kristyan Mjolsnes, head of marketing and sustainability, stated that the company is seeking ""the opportunity to stabilize its business and implement a comprehensive restructuring process.""  ""(It) will enable us to continue servicing our customers and partners and make the necessary investments to achieve our strategic objectives,"" Mjolsnes added.  Even though the company has revenue and capital, it has managed to go bankrupt.  According to the bankruptcy filing, Compute North claims to have between $100 million-$500 million both in estimated liabilities and estimated assets.  Earlier this year, the company raised $385 million in equity and debt funding to finance its new bitcoin mining data centres. $85 million in equity funding came from Mercuria, a global energy and commodities trading company, Generate Capital, an infrastructure investment firm, and other investors. While $300 million came from Generate Capital.  U.S.-based investment group Post Road Group had also invested $25 million in the company. According to The Block, Compute North in July planned to increase its capacity by 1.2 gigawatts over the next 12 months.  Compute North also had the top biggest bitcoin mining firms as clients, including Marathon, which recently started energization at a colocated 280-megawatt bitcoin mining facility in West Texas. The two companies also closed an additional 42-megawatts hosting deal in July.  ""Based on the information available at this time, it is our understanding that this filing will not impact our current mining operations.

"38",485,2022-09-25,"Decrypt","It's the investment bank's second $100 million investment in a Bitcoin mining company this summer, despite the crypto bear market.  Iris Energy, a publicly traded sustainable Bitcoin mining firm (IREN), has agreed to sell investment bank B. Riley Financial up to $100 million in equity over a two-year period.  That’s B. Riley’s second significant investment in the mining sector (it  the same $100 million deal with  in July) despite the industry facing stiffening competition and narrowing profits amid the crypto bear market. The move shows the continued interest some traditional financial firms still have in Bitcoin even in the face of obvious headwinds.  According to a  with the SEC on Friday, B. Riley could buy up to 25 million IREN shares in the 24 months following September 23, amounting to a 31% stake in the company. Iris has already issued 191,174 ordinary shares from that total as consideration for the bank’s commitment.  “We intend to use any proceeds from the Facility to fund our growth initiatives (including hardware purchases and acquisition and development of data center sites and facilities), and for working capital and general corporate purposes,” Iris said in the filing.  Iris added that proceeds from the sale may not be used by Iris in ways that B. Riley does not agree with, or which may “may not yield a significant return.”  Iris shares closed down 9% on Friday, the day of the filing. The stock has plummeted 35% over the past month, and over 85% over the last year.  Such share losses are common across a wide array of crypto firms this year. Core Scientific (CORZ), the other Bitcoin miner B. Riley has invested in, has fallen roughly the same amount in the past year. The publicly traded miner was forced to  the vast majority of its Bitcoin holdings in Q2.    Bitcoin miners profit by earning a fixed number of Bitcoin every time they mine a block, which secures the network. Mining those blocks using a process called proof of work takes a lot of energy, which has led many critics to shun Bitcoin as an environmental scourge—something critics can  after it .  As Bitcoin’s price has fallen across 2022, so too have miner profits. This had led to major Bitcoin selloffs and even  among mining companies. Adding to the trouble is that the network’s hash rate continues to climb, meaning miners must become increasingly cost-efficient to remain competitive.  Nevertheless, major mining operations are investing for the long term. Despite  in July, Core Scientific deployed another 14,000 ASIC servers that same month."

The Cardano project also aims to become a fully decentralized platform with proof-of-stake functionality.  In contrast to these two DeFi platforms, Big Eyes Coin enters the crypto space with new goals and a desire to trump pre-existing projects. Big Eyes is not a quick money scheme; instead, it intends to be a long-term project, setting new records in the crypto space.  Big Eyes: Merging A Utility Token with Its Eco-friendly Goals  Big Eyes is a crypto project with unique goals and characteristics. The Big Eyes crypto project has features to set it apart from other meme projects. Its developers carefully studied the crypto space before designing their project.  While Big Eyes remains a meme-inspired crypto project, it is not a ""Make money and exit"" platform. While Big Eyes intends to make money, it will redistribute these proceeds back to its community members. Thus, it will have the support of its loyal crypto community, keeping it afloat alongside thousands of crypto projects with a short life span.  In addition to improving the financial status of its members, the Big Eyes project is keen on implementing further change in the human community. Big Eyes has devoted part of its resources to charitable organizations.  It aims to bring about change in the environment by educating people and moving them to action to prevent ocean and environmental degradation. As a cat-themed crypto project, it intends to do this to have a lifetime supply of fish as food.  Thus, Big Eyes cares about its members all over the globe. Its support behind these movements to solve environmental problems will help improve its members' quality of life. This support will also publicize its benefits to the world, attracting more people to its platform.  The Big Eyes Crypto Project Compared with Axie Infinity and Cardano  Axie Infinity is a virtual gaming platform. Operating on blockchain technology, it allows its users to profit from trading non-fungible tokens. The Axie Infinity Game-Fi platform involves players engaging in battle to determine who has the strongest army.  Each player can build an army of Axies. These are NFT-like digital assets that look like monsters. Each Axie is unique and has unique metadata securely stored on blockchain technology.  These Axie can be cared for in the Axie Infinity virtual land. They can be grown and mated to create new Axies. However, these Axies' unique features depend on their parent's characteristics.  The Cardano crypto project is a blockchain designed to rival the Ethereum network. It operates as a proof-of-stake protocol, utilizing Ouroboros, a new type of proof-of-stake protocol.  Cardano operates as a multilayered blockchain to make its network fast and cheap. It separates its computational and accounting layers, preventing congestion within its ecosystem.  Axie Infinity and Cardano have their primary cryptocurrency for their platforms.  Axie Infinity has two digital assets, Axie Shards (AXS) and Smooth Love Portion (SLP), that serve as reward tokens. The AXS token also serves as a governance token within the Axie Infinity ecosystem.  ADA tokens are governance tokens within the Cardano ecosystem. It gives all holders voting rights to determine the future of the Cardano project. Holders can also stake ADA tokens for rewards.  Buy The Big Eyes Presale Today  Unlike ADA and Axie Infinity tokens, Big Eyes Coin is yet to be fully released. In the coming months, it will become available on the Uniswap platform.

It's not a stretch of truth to anyone who's been around the digital assets space for a while that almost every project, except the industry’s magnum opus bitcoin, succeeds in constructing effective public relations to sell their  project. This is no surprise as the tens of billions raised over the past several years had to go somewhere, and it definitely did not go to building new innovative technology.  One area that bitcoin has fallen short in the public relations department, and the focus of this piece, is in the framing of how blocks are validated, colloquially called proof-of-work (PoW) or mining.  Firstly, How Does Mining Work?  In a nutshell bitcoin miners use PoW, which uses energy, to find a needle in a haystack. When they find the needle, they use it to create and add a new block to Bitcoin's blockchain. When this new block is added, the miner gets rewarded with newly minted bitcoin. To date, this is the most decentralized means to achieving network consensus and creating valid blocks. More on bitcoin mining .  Bitcoin Mining And The Framing Effect  In a world where capital is directed by criteria like environmental, social and governance (ESG) scores, green narratives in adoption of new technology are becoming increasingly important.  Knowing this, the perceived high energy costs of bitcoin mining and the term mining itself, which is associated with environmental destruction, has become a barrier to bitcoins adoption and a red herring used by DINO projects to discredit bitcoin and pump their bags.  Relatively speaking though, bitcoin mining's energy usage is quite small and is . The reason people look past these realities is due to a cognitive bias known as the .  ""The framing effect is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations.""  The term mining comes with many negative connotations (see image below). With other digital assets available that promise similar solutions to bitcoin with a much smaller environmental footprint, naïve users in many cases will choose them over bitcoin due to the framing effect.  People think of this when they hear mining.  I won't get into the details in this piece, but the ""greener"" solution proof-of-stake (PoS) is  and will inevitably lead to centralization. Though with the complexities underpinning both PoW and PoS, it's no surprise that people make choices due to superficial reasons, such as naïve views on energy.  A psychological theory that underpins the framing effect is known as the  explains why:  ""The prospect theory holds that individuals are more influenced by the possibility of a loss than the prospect of an equivalent gain.""  Most people don't understand that the gain of PoW (More energy use, but decentralized) is greater than the loss of PoS (Less energy use, but centralized). Although it's easy to understand the loss from a purely environmental perspective.  This is exacerbated by the fact that the majority of people today  societal problem and sensationalist pieces such as  circulate regularly. This is how the framing effect manifests as individuals are only shown the context of one of the frames (the environmental one).  So, what can we do to overcome the framing effect and have people realize bitcoin mining isn't going to boil the oceans and is actually a good use of energy? We could take a note out of DINO handbook and leverage narratives that have less negative connotations associated with them to our benefit.  How could this be applied to bitcoin mining? Well ...  Let's Call Bitcoin Miners, Bitcoin Validators  With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, Ethereum has moved from mining with PoW, to using validators with PoS. Mining and miners as we know them will no longer exist on Ethereum, and  reduction in energy usage have been cited.  These energy savings are a red herring as it comes at the cost of decentralization. Decentralization is a fundamental first principle of cryptocurrencies, without it they are useless. A centralized public cryptocurrency's energy usage, even if tiny, is 100% wasted as the network has failed. Bitcoiners know this, and it's why they will never .  So, back to the framing effect. The term validators has much more positive connotations towards it due to DINOs marketing efforts, and it's not as loaded of a term as mining. Less negative connotations means people will perceive the term more positively. Avoiding the framing effect by using a more media friendly term like validator will make it easier for people to understand the gain of PoW (More energy use, but decentralized) is greater than the loss of PoS (Less energy use, but centralized).  DINO has done all the work here by shifting the narrative to being PoS > PoW. The least we can do is leverage this effort for our benefit as they have done time and time again using the bitcoins brand to justify their Rube Goldberg machine.  So, calling bitcoin miners, bitcoin validators can prevent the framing effect from occurring and shift the narrative towards PoS < PoW. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum using the same term also makes discussions contrasting the two less nuanced making it easier for people to grasp. It's also more of a technically correct and explicit term as producing valid blocks is what miners (validators) do.  Below are the mining related terms we should change:  Bitcoin mining pools = Bitcoin validator pools  Bitcoin miners = Bitcoin validators  Bitcoin mining = Bitcoin validating  Summary  In summary, re-framing PoW mining to PoW validating will benefit bitcoin long term by preventing the framing effect from occurring which is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations.  Mining = negative connotations.  Validating = positive connotations (thanks Ethereum).  This is a guest post by Doc Sharp.

"41",1338,2022-09-23,"Decrypt","The merge has inflicted chaos upon Ethereum—was it all worth it? Some Ethereum loyalists aren’t so sure  “What do you think of the merge?” I recently innocently asked William “Wills” de Vogelaere, co-founder of Spankchain and probably half a dozen other protocols in the grisly underworld of .  I was, of course, referring to the long-awaited software upgrade which booted Ethereum’s  and replaced them with a cohort of environmentally friendly stakeholders on September 15.  “You mean Ethereum’s delusion?” de Vogelaere rejoined bitterly.  “Oho!” I thought. This could get juicy. It turned out de Vogelaere was voicing an opinion rarely broadcast in public: that the merge was a mistake. Or, if not an italicized mistake, some kind of irrelevant distraction.  “It didn’t add anything of value really other than the environmental factor,” he fulminated.  In de Vogelaere’s view, the whole enterprise has been a naive capitulation. The influential people fretting about Ethereum’s enormous carbon footprint, he said, were only ever exploiting environmentalist fears for their own cynical ends. “No one actually gives a shit if something’s green, so long as it works,” he said. “Corporations don’t fucking care as long as they can be perceived to care.”  Maronn’! Admittedly, it’s not hard to see why people like de Vogelaere are in a bad mood—since the merge unfolded, the price of ETH has tanked. Bitcoin supporters are ridiculing the change.  about Ethereum now being a “security” have raised the hackles of even the most old-school of Ethereum connoisseurs—and even driven some to the embrace of a long-ago spurned band of fanatical Ethereum militants. (We’ll get to that.)  As de Vogalaere told me, the notion that public opinion of Ethereum would improve in the wake of the merge may have proven to be a canard. The regulators, he said, will hardly change their tune now this one environmental grievance has been eliminated, especially given that newfound willingness to brand it a security.    And yes, yes, the merge was a fabulous display of technical competence. Merging Ethereum in real-time was the equivalent of switching up a car’s engine as it booms full-throttle down a freeway, so we’re told. It’s groundbreaking from an R&D perspective—but so was the atom bomb.  Even so, de Vogelaere believes, the supposed technical improvements of the merge are overhyped. It was supposed to facilitate various upgrades that would introduce more efficiencies into the network. But de Vogelaere believes these solutions have long existed anyway, in the form of sidechains—appendages to the flagship network that use different validation methods—such as . Only Ethereum’s computing environment, the “Virtual Machine,” has any real value, he argued—and that isn’t affected in any meaningful way by the shift to the staking model.  He also (good heavens!) pointed out that those who don’t have the minimum amount to stake independently—32 ETH, around $42,500 dollars and dropping at time of writing—have to stake via centralized exchanges like Coinbase. That means putting the majority of Ethereum on a corporate exchange with a single point of failure.    So, we’ve established that Ethereum’s price is now in the shitter and the regulators are on the move. But is de Vogelaere’s view perhaps just a minority one?  Not so! Kristy Leigh-Minehan, a longtime Ethereum miner (who may admittedly be a little bit biased), is not quite anti-merge in the same rancorous vein as our de Vogelaere. Rather, she wonders whether it came about a bit too soon. “The move to proof of stake is a key part of Ethereum's D and was always intended,” she said. “It was necessary and required for future optimizations and scalability features—the question everyone needs to ask themselves is: was now the right time?”  Minehan isn’t so sure. “I, personally, do not think it was in the current regulatory climate,” she said. She wonders whether the prospect of ETH being newly classed as a security could risk “scaring validators, operators, and entrepreneurs.” The primacy of American regulators in particular, she added, can be unnerving. Echoing de Vogelaere, she said: “There is no denying Ethereum has taken root in the USA–that will be its biggest strength and weakness.”  At least some pedigreed Ethereum advocates remain sanguine. “It could be the case that this has some impact on regulatory decision making,” ventured Mat Dryhurst, a left-leaning podcaster and one of the earliest adopters of NFTs. “But to be honest, I don't get much of an impression that is too much of a concern on the dev side. People are excited to build more utility for the network, and the merge felt like a celebration of another milestone on a long roadmap.”  But isn’t it admittedly a bit overhyped? “It is not a grand technological innovation, and I don't think it was intended to be,” Dryhurst demurred. “Rollups, zkEVMs [zero-knowledge virtual machines] etc are still needed to scale. I think if anything it just establishes credibility for this corner of crypto, and increases confidence that other ideas being discussed will be executed upon.” He added that he was recently at ETH Berlin and that the energy was “as optimistic as ever.”  The gleeful old guard  There is, maybe, one cohort that fully agrees with all de Vogelaere and his ilk’s dire diagnoses of the merge—and is unabashedly jubilant about them. They are the custodians of another now-defunct network that, they would argue, was, like the miners, also betrayed by the craven handlers of Ethereum proper: an older, abandoned iteration of Ethereum network called Ethereum Classic whose supporters are arguably the most OG that you can get in the brief but melodramatic lifespan of Ethereum politics.  Ethereum Classic was born in 2016 in the wake of a deleterious hack of the Ethereum network’s first decentralized autonomous organization, or The DAO. Mainstream Ethereum developers voted overwhelmingly to “roll back” the hack and make victims' whole, which a few sticklers viewed as a deadly betrayal of Ethereum’s core principle of immutability. They clung to the old, hacked network, and Ethereum was cleft in two. They have been waiting ever since for the merge, believing that newly unemployed miners (whom they actively tried to ) would flock to Ethereum Classic in search of new revenue.  Incredibly, after six years of patient anticipation, they were right.    “We’ve seen significantly increased interest in Ethereum Classic in the last couple of months,” said Bob Summerwill, the executive director of the ETC Cooperative, the foundation behind the development of Ethereum Classic, whose ticker is ETC. “The merge was obviously a catalyst.” He added that the amount of mining power on the network has since increased around tenfold, and that Ethereum Classic is now the third largest proof-of-work chain by market cap and second by volume.  Summerwill, as with others, pointed out that fears around U.S.-capture of the network and newly vigorous regulators may have galvanized many of these miners and driven them to ETC. “Ethereum Classic seems to be benefitting from providing a known and likely safer alternative on these concerns,” he said. It has nevertheless been a bumpy start: Ethereum Classic, as with many others, took a recent dip, and its miners are operating at a loss. “We’re still trying to find a new equilibrium,” Summerwill said.  Still, it’s a somewhat stunning reversal. After years of agonizing waiting, you have to wonder whether the curmudgeonly old pedants of the Ethereum Classic network—and, even, Ethereum’s would-be regulators—have got the last laugh.  As de Vogelaere said: “ETH may have played its motherfucking self.”"
"42",337,2022-09-23,"Blockchain.News","The World Economic Forum (WEF) has established a Crypto Sustainability Coalition to investigate the capability of Web3 in tackling climate change.  In a , the WEF noted that blockchain tools would propel transparency in the worldwide carbon credits market, whereas crypto mining would trigger renewable microgrids through off-peak demand and decentralization.  Since the adoption of technologies like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchains, and cryptocurrencies in Web 3.0, members of the coalition will find out how they can boost social and environmental agendas.  The coalition also seeks regulatory clarity that enhances Web3 innovation, propels financial inclusion, and protects consumers.  Brynly Llyr, World Economic Forum's head of blockchain and digital assets, noted:  I am excited about the work we are expecting from the Crypto Sustainability Coalition. An important and unique aspect of web3 is that it uses technology to support and reward direct community engagement and action.  Llyr added:  This means we can coordinate the work of many individuals directly with one another, enabling collective action without centralized control a powerful accelerator for grass roots action.  The Crypto Sustainability Coalition consist of 30 partners hosted by the WEF as a public-private initiative. Its primary areas of concern include Web3's potential for climate action, energy usage, and on-chain carbon credits.  Some partners include Solana, Circle, NEAR Foundation, PlanetWatch, University of Lisbon, eToro, Crypto Council for Innovation, and Sustainable Bitcoin Standard.  Moreover, the coalition will come up with best practices and tangible action on how Web3 technologies can positively impact communities most affected by climate change. The report noted:  The coalition's wider aim is to foster a broad education campaign on what Web3's potential and capacity look like, to better inform governments on how they regulate these technologies and incentivize investment and research into their development.  Meanwhile, a report by Chainlink Labs and Tecnalia noted that blockchain technology could help fight the climate crisis through smart contracts,  reported."
"43",757,2022-09-22,"Decrypt","The blockchain network has unveiled a prototype of its games console, which aims to 'hide the complexity of Web3 from the end-user.'  Layer-1 blockchain Zilliqa is preparing to dive into the world of Web3 gaming, with the launch of a hardware console and gaming hub.  A prototype version of the console was unveiled today, showcasing a sleek design with an array of ports including HDMI, Ethernet and USB-C and USB 3.0 connections. Full specifications for the console remain under wraps, though Zilliqa touts its user-friendliness, with Web3 capabilities including a crypto wallet and mining integrated to ""hide the complexity of Web3 from the end-user,"" according to a press release shared with Decrypt.  Zilliqa’s engineers spent six months in the research phase, designing and testing the console with the intent of seamlessly integrating Web3 aspects—crypto wallet, mining software, blockchain tech—into a recognizable gaming experience.    Zilliqa “took the approach of hiding the complexity of creating the embedded Web3 wallet”, Valentin Cobelea, Head of Gaming Technology at Zilliqa, told Decrypt. Cobelea pointed to the example of NFT collection  as a benchmark to emulate.  Players will be able to to earn Zilliqa (ZIL) tokens through the completion of in-game “skill-to-earn” missions, tasks and quests. In this case, the tokens can be regarded as similar to coins or rewards in traditional games, but with the added functions of blockchain technology.  Additionally, Zilliqa noted that “players will be able to mine ZIL tokens”, a process that they anticipate will “lead to further decentralization of the Zilliqa blockchain by expanding the number of miners globally.”  On the subject of exactly how much revenue gamers could earn, both for skilled participation and mining, Cobelea said that their income “depends on how good the gamers are, and the amount they earn will be reflective of that.”  Although Zilliqa has yet to release details of the console's pricing, it states that the console ""can eventually pay for itself.""  What is Zilliqa?  Zilliqa, which was founded in 2017 and launched two years later on mainnet, is a layer-1  blockchain. In recent months it's aggressively pursued efforts to expand its influence in the gaming sphere, joining the Blockchain Gaming Alliance (BGA) in April this year, and forging partnerships with esports teams MAD Lions, RRQ, and more recently Alien Worlds and XBorg.    Zilliqa's partnership with Web3 esports organization XBorg will see XBorg's community assist with the creation of gaming tournaments, and marketing endeavours, as well as receiving beta access to test Zilliqa’s gaming hub in October.  Following this testing phase, the gaming console is scheduled to launch in the first quarter of 2023, with the joint release of two Zilliqa-native titles including the first-person shooter (FPS) game WEB3WAR.  The growth of Web3 gaming  Web3 gaming revolves around the principle that players should have full autonomy and ownership over their acquired assets, using blockchain technology such as non-fungible tokens ().  With cryptographically unique NFTs representing in-game assets such as weaponry, skins and badges, the idea is that the player can own their digital property, sell it on or even migrate it between virtual worlds in the nascent .  But early adopters of blockchain gaming technology have faced a backlash from skeptics in the traditional gaming community, who've raised concerns over the  for the gameplay experience, the  of blockchain and the  of  gaming on consumers in emerging markets.

"45",1349,2022-09-22,"CryptoDaily","The year so far has been nothing but brutal to the crypto market. Despite continuous development and innovation in the blockchain space, coins have dropped magnificently with the total market capitalization of the crypto market, which stood at $3 trillion in November last year, now less than $1 trillion - representing over a 68% drop in less than a year. The decentralized finance (DeFi) market has witnessed a tougher drop from $97 billion at its peak to $26.26 billion, as of writing. And the once-raging non-fungible tokens (NFT) space needs no explanation - it is technically dead - with NFTs that cost millions of dollars trading over 90% less in value.  Nonetheless, if you have been in the crypto market long enough, you must be convinced that the current bear market is just a phase and the market will bounce back quicker than most experts expect. However, as the crypto tides rise, not all projects will rise with it, most of the “useless” projects drowning with no chance of recovery - even when the bull market returns.  In this piece, we focus on some of the projects that could be on their way to recovery despite the grime market conditions. We focus on the resistance these projects are showing during the bear market (despite dropping from all-time high values), the developmental promise they offer, their growing communities, the long-term value they will offer, and most importantly, their innovation in the blockchain space.  Here are five of the top projects you should set your bets on as you await the end of this treacherous bear market.  * Ethereum: A new look proof-of-stake blockchain  Nothing has captivated the crypto and blockchain community quite like Ethereum merge since the Luna/Terra collapse this year. On September 15th, the second largest blockchain successfully completed its transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the merge, officially deprecating proof-of-work and reducing energy consumption by approximately 99.95%. This is expected to reduce the total world energy consumption by about 0.05%.  While the energy consumption is a great deal to conserving the environment, the thing that places Ethereum on our list is the burn rate that is expected to remove over 1.5 million ETH from the ecosystem every year. This offers a great opportunity for Ethereum’s value growth, with the supply decreasing every year. Could we see Ethereum finally overtake Bitcoin as the number one cryptocurrency?  * T3rn - Full reversion of all blockchain executions  If you have ever sent crypto or NFT to the wrong address or the wrong amount, you know it is impossible to recover the funds. This has been a contentious issue across the blockchain community, with proponents of the irreversibility stating it helps to keep the blockchain secure and prevents any interference from third parties, whether centralized exchanges, governments, or banks. On the flip side, opponents argue that for crypto to become a global monetary currency, reversibility of transactions should be implemented, as human mistakes, hacking and theft will remain prevalent despite crypto being implemented.  One project, t3rn aims to make this a possibility while maintaining the security properties of blockchains. t3rn is a smart contract hosting platform that offers an innovative solution to interoperable smart contract execution with fail-safe mechanisms built in, that allows only successful transactions to be executed. The t3rn protocol focuses specifically on the fail-safe aspect of cross-chain execution, where an execution finishes in all of the connected blockchains or rolls back all of the trice (side effects).  This improves the blockchain ecosystem as a whole, as any mistake (address or amount of funds) can be rectified before it's finalized while maintaining the security of the blockchains connected. As more people adopt the newest innovation in the blockchain space, the adoption rates of crypto will easily go up. It is truly a game-changer in the crypto and blockchain space.  * Rootstock (RSK) - Bitcoin-based smart contracts  It’s almost impossible to look at the future of crypto without including the largest blockchain, Bitcoin, in the conversation. Our third project selection for a futuristic future in the blockchain space is Rootstock (RSK), a project offering users decentralized finance (DeFi) built on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was specifically created with high restrictions when executing smart contracts in a bid to make it very secure and robust, the launch of blockchains such as Ethereum challenged the developers to create a better platform that could execute advanced smart contracts on Bitcoin.  Hence the launch of Rootstock.  Since its launch, the platform has welcomed a number of projects into the fray. Recently, the RSK client WakeUp Labs entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with Kilimo (Swahili for ‘agriculture’), a ""climate tech"" start-up that verifies the water consumption of agriculture businesses. In partnership with WakeUp Labs, an environmental conservation protocol built on RSK, and Kilimo will issue tokenized certificates, or verification NFTs, to entrepreneurs and farmers who create and use responsible water conservation techniques.  Additionally, Rootstock also hosts the BitGive Foundation, one of the leading blockchain protocols for making charitable donations. Finally, 88i, an insurance platform, is also built on RSK technology offering clients care services in their insurance in a timely and relevant manner. The platform offers different customers connected with insurance brokers a fast, transparent and easy way to pay their insurance.  * Looking Glass - Prime Non-fungible token (“NFT”) architecture  As the NFT craze reached a fever pitch in 2021, several developers noticed two major obstacles that were hindering the widespread adoption of this latest blockchain-based innovation. The first obstacle was the overall complexity of the creation and purchase experiences, the second obstacle was the lack of applications/blockchains or wallets in which NFTs can be used. With much fanfare still held in these assets, despite the crash in prices during the course of 2022, new NFT platforms are offering investors solutions to these obstacles in a bid to take NFTs back to their all-time high values.  Such a project is Looking Glass Labs (LGL), a Web3 platform specializing in the non-fungible token (“NFT”) architecture, immersive metaverse environments, play-to-earn tokenization and virtual asset royalty streams. While current NFT games offer 2D images and lower quality images, LGL allows users to curate next-generation 3D metaverses, allowing functional art and collectibles to exist simultaneously across different NFT blockchain environments.  * Bridge Champ - Bridge online gameplays  Despite blockchain games facing criticism in the recent past, it remains one of the quickest and surest ways for blockchain to reach global adoption. According to a Citi Group report, the metaverse and blockchain gaming space will become a $30 billion market by 2030, with VC companies spending over $4.5 billion on the metaverse so far in 2022. Facebook (now Meta) has already spent over $12 billion on their metaverse project so far.  The potential for growth is immense.  Jelurida, a blockchain software company that develops and maintains the Nxt and Ardor blockchains, is aiming to capture this market with its investment in Bridge Champ, an online platform that combines bridge gameplay with tournaments and a growing social context to connect millions of players globally. The company makes it easier than ever to design, build and implement custom decentralized applications on public platforms or as private, permissioned or hybrid solutions. As traditional games move to the blockchain, contact bridges such as Bridge Champ will be important to bring more gamers into the space.  Conclusion  As we end the year, crypto markets look very unlikely to recover their 2021 bullish run. As investors, looking for the right project with a long term value proposition could be the key to big gains if the market recovers in future. The list above is in no way exhaustive but give a pretty good picture of which projects could shape the upcoming bullish run, if any happens in 2023.

The organizations are looking to partner and use blockchain to foster trade collaboration, growth, and sustainability among new and existing Free Zone enterprises. The partnership would also explore the creation of a Virtual Free Zone within the Lekki Free Zone (LFZ).  Lekki Free Zone’s Head of Strategy, Innovation & Special Projects, Mr. Tomiwa Idowu, has disclosed that discussions are ongoing between LZF, the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority, and the Gluwa team.  In a statement, Idowu explained that the partnership, when finalized, will create a dashboard for the tokenization of goods into NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and provide digital asset-backed loans for new and existing enterprises who are looking to fund operations and/or expand their businesses, similar to the integration of OpenSea and Compound.  Idowu shared his vision for innovating the trading and industrial sector in Nigeria and Africa as a whole, bringing it into the modern information age with the Lekki Free Zone at the epicenter.  “I am extremely excited by the enormous potential of such a partnership, which would further establish Lagos State as Africa’s leading sub-national in terms of innovation, economic development and revenue generation,” said Idowu.  He commended the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, as a beacon of progress and hope for the nation in general, saying: “Our Governor has always been a firm believer in fast-paced development, which involves using technology to leapfrog bureaucracy and going straight to solving immediate problems.”  Chief Executive Officer at Gluwa, Tae Oh, noted that the firm is keen to partner with the Lekki Free Zone as it is the largest and most developed Free Zone in Nigeria with proximity to the deep-sea port as well as the Dangote refinery, saying: “Trading has been the bedrock of the Nigerian economy, with annual volumes running into billions of dollars.”  He added: “We believe the digitization of the sector can allow us to harness its full potential. For instance, a standard process to digitize goods manufactured or processed within the zone in tandem with a market system on web3 will allow manufacturers to trade globally via the blockchain.  “All trades will be registered and benefit from the incentives of the Lekki Free Zone, such as zero taxation and free circulation of goods. As soon as the goods get settled for export by the in-Zone Customs Processing Center, they will get shipped out straight from the Lekki Free Zone via the deep-sea port.  “This will reduce delays, eliminate human errors, exponentially drive up Nigeria’s non-oil exports and sustain a positive trade balance for the nation. While we are still working out the fine details and a specific framework with NEPZA, we believe it is the future of commerce and trade in Africa.”  About Gluwa  Gluwa is an Open Finance platform, connecting capital from developed markets to emerging market lending opportunities using blockchain technology.

Bitcoin Lake took a different approach by starting small with the repurposing of used cooking oil to power bitcoin mining ASICs.  “This cooking oil would either be thrown out into the street or find its way to the landfill which sits several hundred feet above Lake Atitlán,” Melder explained. “Either way, it would find its way into the watershed and into the lake.”  By kickstarting this initiative, Melder said he expects to trigger a snowball effect in neighboring communities as they realize cleaning the environment can not only be feasible but also profitable.  “All community leaders and the citizens of the lake are concerned about the environment but there are limited tools and resources to tackle the problem. So our goal is to create a ‘sliding scale’ use of wasted/stranded energy to mine bitcoin and in the process clean the lake and create wealth in the communities. It’s a sliding scale because in one small community, we may simply have a ‘Kaboom-like’ project or we may have small bio-digesters collecting waste.”  Beyond Mining  Melder used to travel with his family to the city of Panajachel, Guatemala, every summer during his daughters’ undergraduate school years, but after they graduated from college, those trips to the Central American country came to an end. However, Melder and his wife kept seeking ways to come back. It wasn’t too long until he found out about Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, which ultimately inspired him to travel once more to Panajachel and start Bitcoin Lake.  “My desire was to bring the Bitcoin Beach model to Panajachel which is a beautiful town on Lake Atitlán in the Guatemalan highlands,” he wrote in a 2021  that detailed his vision for the project.  In addition to cleaning up the lake, Melder detailed in that blog post the other goals that Bitcoin Lake would set out to achieve from the start, including helping a local education center and creating economic opportunities for the “small but vibrant Guatemalan town.” Since then, Bitcoin has been at the forefront of the project’s work.  “Everything we do in the community is related to bitcoin. It is either funded by bitcoin, teaches about bitcoin or is taught or implemented by bitcoiners,” Melder told Bitcoin Magazine. “Our three goals in the community are to teach about bitcoin, create a bitcoin circular economy and clean the environment with bitcoin mining as the economic incentive.”  While Bitcoin Lake tackles the latter, the other two goals have not been sidelined. On the education front, the project has helped introduce Bitcoin-related coursework to the local education center Centro Educativo Josué.  “The children there are taught about every aspect of Bitcoin, from ‘what is money?,’ ‘what is inflation?,’ ‘why bitcoin was created,’ to the basics of bitcoin mining, setting up a bitcoin full node, etc.,” Melder detailed. “We are proud to say that we have been doing this since January of 2022 developing our own curriculum along the way and we’ve had Bitcoiners from around the world come and help.”  The work that began at the local school has since proliferated to a broader audience in the town, Melder said, in an attempt to help folks of all ages learn more about the world of peer-to-peer digital money.  “We’ve held bitcoin educational meetings for adults and business owners in the community and striven to include the indigenous community leaders as well,” he said.  With a better understanding of the technology, adoption is facilitated as users and business owners aren’t caught off guard or coerced into using bitcoin. Rather, a movement begins, naturally.  “Since we’ve started in January of this year, we’ve onboarded over 60 businesses in and around Panajachel, and in Guatemala as a whole we have about 200 businesses that we have onboarded to accept bitcoin,” Melder explained.  As awareness about Bitcoin grows and adoption keeps increasing, the community is set to keep expanding its initiatives. On the mining front, Melder expects to further develop the repurposing of wasted and stranded resources to increase the community’s steady income and improve the efficiency of the lake’s clean-up even more.  “Our environmental cleanup/Bitcoin mining initiative just started, but will grow to the point in about a year that we can actually take unsorted landfill waste (new or old) and turn it into a clean energy source to mine bitcoin,” Melder forecasted. “We are working with a group out of the U.K. to bring this to life and it will have a major impact in Panajachel and Guatemala as we now have an economic incentive to clean the massive waste issue that exists in Guatemala and in most developing countries. We are proud that we will be first to market with this technology.”"
"49",609,2022-09-21,"U.Today","Valeria Blokhina  Read U.Today’s crypto news digest to make sure you’re not missing any of the latest events in the industry!  Take a look at what's happening in the world of crypto by reading U.Today’s top four news stories.  Cardano becomes inspiration for Snoop Dogg's son's new musical album  Champ Medici, son of world-famous rapper Snoop Dogg and well-known crypto enthusiast, has released , with its main theme being Cardano and its most high-profile NFT project Clay Mates. It is the first release of the young artist since he officially joined  in August of this year. The new mini album is titled Clay Nation Tapes Vol. I and consists of three tracks: Manifest, ADA Dreams and Lil Flex’n. In all three, Medici describes his crypto experience with bravado and enthusiasm. Judging by the album’s title, it will not be the last musical collaboration between Champ Medici and Clay Nation. However, the release date of the album’s second part is yet unknown.  Ripple shovels 50 million XRP to anon wallet, here's what it means for market  , WhaleStats, a crypto transactions tracker, detected a total of nearly 582 million XRP on the move. Among these astonishing amounts of Ripple-affiliated token was a 50 million XRP transaction to an anonymous wallet conducted by Ripple. However, according to another tracker, Bithomp, this massive chunk of XRP was sent to Ripple’s own alternative address, RL18-VN. The address is used for sending XRP beyond the fintech giant — to institutional customers and exchanges, to sell or support the coin's liquidity, and to custodial wallets such as BitGo. This means that Ripple is preparing to inject another 50 million XRP into circulation as the token’s price is increasing. XRP is currently trading at $0.4061, per CoinMarketCap.  Congressional candidate says Cardano is efficient blockchain  In a recent tweet, , a congressional candidate and representative of the United Utah Party, called Cardano an “efficient” blockchain. She also mentioned Bitcoin in her post, but the largest crypto did not get praise from Walker. Instead, BTC was referred to as an example of an “inefficient” blockchain. On the first day of the week, the candidate encountered some backlash on Twitter after writing that blockchains could solve the water crisis. Many users did not share her enthusiasm for the cutting-edge technology. However, she explained that it could be possible to enhance sustainability, compliance and consumption management by integrating blockchain and IoT technologies.    Ads  Amazon to help burn 140 million SHIB, here’s how much will be burned via e-commerce giant  According to @shib_superstore, a Twitter account created by Travis Johnson, by the end of September, the amount of  is likely to surpass 140 million meme tokens, or $1,500 in fiat equivalent. The Amazon affiliate program that Johnson began to use earlier this year is going to help him do that. The amount of SHIB burned via Amazon at this pace will be roughly 27,649,769 SHIB evaluated at $300. In the meantime, the pace at which the community is removing SHIB tokens from circulation appears to have slowed down. Even with 40% of it having already been sent to dead-end wallets and locked in them permanently, the price still would not skyrocket to $1 or even to $0.001, as many had hoped earlier this year."
"50",710,2022-09-21,"Cryptonews.com","XRP's price has fallen this year, as has the price of many other cryptocurrencies. The large-cap coin has dropped 52.3% since the beginning of the year, mirroring the overall declines of the cryptocurrency market, which is not surprising given its position.  XRP, despite its decline, remains an appealing investment option for investors. As the year closes out, there is renewed hope that the coin's value will rise. This article will share three reasons for this hope.  Ripple's XRP token has become the market's de facto standard for cross-border payments, and it has a significant use case for investors looking to earn and users requiring crypto-specific functionality.  SEC Case Could Come to a Close  The case between XRP's developer, California-based Ripple Labs, and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been a major impediment for the past year and a half.  In December 2020, the securities regulator sued Ripple, accusing the company of violating securities laws when it offered XRP to investors in its initial coin offering (ICO).  The case has significantly impacted XRP, including the asset's delisting from several cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it may have far-reaching market implications because it may pave the way for the SEC to classify digital assets as securities in the future.  Meanwhile, there was renewed optimism last week that Ripple would prevail in this legal battle. Both parties sought summary judgment in separate  with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  These judgments are filed when a party believes there is enough evidence to make a decision without a trial. Furthermore, Ripple's leadership has maintained that the SEC has failed to establish a foundation for classifying XRP as a security.  It is unclear whether the SEC case will be resolved soon. Nonetheless, XRP investors are optimistic.  CFTC Visit Boosts Prospects for Favorable Classification  While battling the SEC over the best classification for XRP, Ripple Labs appears to be in advanced talks with another financial watchdog.  Caroline Pham, the Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), confirmed earlier this week that she met with Ripple Labs CEO Brad Garlinghouse as part of her ""learning tour"" on cryptocurrency. The visit raised hopes that XRP could be classified as a commodity rather than a security, as the SEC desires.  Proponents of cryptocurrencies have repeatedly argued that the CFTC should regulate them. Thus, Pham's visit to Ripple and her interaction with Garlinghouse raises the sentiment of holders as well as the position of law enforcement and regulators.  Energy Consumption in the Spotlight  For over a year, the crypto market has been admonished for its role in climate change. Tesla has stopped accepting Bitcoin as payment, and several legislators have expressed their disdain for digital assets and their excessive resource consumption.  However, Ripple wishes to alter the narrative. Earlier this week, Ripple Labs announced that it had signed the Climate Pledge, joining over 375 other companies working to create an energy-positive future.  The market's focus will likely remain on energy consumption. Ethereum recently completed its proof-of-stake (PoS) transition, which is expected to reduce up to 0.2% of global carbon emissions. Ripple is putting itself at the forefront of this battle to stay ahead of the curve for good.  Tamadoge: Perfect for Investors Looking for Gains  Although XRP appears to be an intriguing asset, there are other massive opportunities for investors to profit. One such opportunity is presented by Tamadoge (TAMA).  , which debuted in 2022, bills itself as a ""play-to-earn Dogecoin."" Presently, it is among the most popular projects in blockchain gaming, allowing players to earn via its native TAMA token. The platform is also attempting to break into the metaverse, with its native Tamaverse launching soon.  TAMA recently completed its presale, raising a total of $19 million. This presale outperformed that of several well-known cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. TAMA is now expected to list on centralized exchanges, making it more accessible to investors. With the Tamadoge platform expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of this year, it might be best to buy the coin now."
"51",1995,2022-09-21,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Level39, a researcher focused on Bitcoin, technology, history, ethics and energy.  The notion that Ethereum’s recent “Merge,” from proof of work to proof of stake, reduces energy consumption  is a myth. Nevermind that this calculation excludes expensive ,  and the increased work involved in completing proof of stake transactions on a global scale. Follow the money — the cost to make a transaction has not plummeted. Fees , and any part of the security budget that was previously used to purchase energy for machines will instead be used to purchase energy for Ethereum’s ruling class — negating much of its lower energy bill.  Unlike proof of work, which  and , there is no environmental advantage to proof of stake other than that it obscures the energy purchases made by the people that enable its validating infrastructure. The environmental myth of proof of stake is underscored by a neo-Luddite belief that replacing inefficient humans and their infrastructure with economical and energy-intensive machines is a net negative — an ideology that harkens back to the early days of the Industrial Revolution.  The Age Of Luddites  During the  (1811 to 1816), Ned Ludd inspired a movement of highly-skilled English textile workers to resist modernization and destroy a particular kind of mechanized textile machine that would be “ .” Commonality referred to the common good, as in the tradition of the commons. The machines were seen as a threat to communities and the jobs that were destined to become obsolete. These new textile machines could work harder, faster and cheaper than any group of skilled artisans. It was feared that the machines would also lead to mass unemployment in the community and further unequal power relations. The Luddites protested this technological advancement, sabotaged the machinery and attacked its owners.  Over time, Luddite fears were proven wrong. Mechanized technology would not destroy employment. On the contrary, it freed up humans to do more productive and creative things with their time. The vast increase in raw materials translated into even more work for creating increasingly elaborate and cost-effective products. Economic energy-powered technology improves living standards, increases wealth and offers more opportunities for employment.  Benefits From Automation  Automating human effort with energy-intensive machinery is an age-old practice. In 1582, the English merchant fleet had a carrying capacity of . Commercial fees were used to purchase energy by way of acquiring food, ale, clothing, heat and medicine for tens of thousands of sailors and their families. Security, efficiency, safety and reliability were common issues for these fleets.  Today, global shipping uses energy-intensive machines but involves relatively very few humans. The container ship  was the largest container ship ever built, at the time of its 2017 delivery, and can carry 200,000 tons while requiring a crew of only 22. Rather than sourcing power to sustain populations of sailors, we build machines that burn energy and liberate humans from mundane and mechanical tasks. This allows humans to do more productive tasks, which in turn unleashes human flourishing.  Modern, energy-intensive container ships are orders of magnitude more efficient and reliable than the merchant fleets of the Middle Ages. It would be thoughtless to assume container ships are wasteful simply because they use more energy than sailing ships. Machines, while energy intensive, replace the energy-intensive requirements of humans who are better suited to do other tasks.  Proof Of Work Is Novel Technology  Proof of work uses energy-intensive machines that put people in traditional finance out of work and frees them up to do more productive things for society so that they too can acquire the ability to purchase energy-intensive activities. Outdated finance jobs become automated and the new energy-intensive work of global settlement moves to smaller groups of miners in rural communities who have access to stranded power — reversing some of the destructive power relationships that Luddites rebelled against more than a century ago.  Instead of massive buildings full of energy-consuming bean counters — secured and backed by energy-intensive governments and militaries around the world — we now have energy-intensive proof-of-work mining machines that effectively guess the number of beans for global settlement, every 10 minutes. This process enables dependable, non-stop, global settlement without prejudice, without rest, and for much less overall cost.  Proof Of Stake Is Legacy Technology   — there is nothing new about it. It is a classical form of  that has been used for centuries. The tendency for  makes it an easy target for regulatory capture, which in turn requires more humans working to ensure compliance, maintain control and leads to increased fees. Physical work by machines, competing over real global resources, is the only method that can reduce or eliminate outdated oligopolistic governance and repressive fees while ensuring censorship resistance.  In a , Ethereum Co-Founder Vitalik Buterin boasted that Ethereum could very well have a larger security budget than Bitcoin, in the future. This is a tacit admission that he expects that Ethereum’s elite validators will have significantly more energy-purchasing power than Bitcoin miners do. After all, the ability to purchase energy is entirely limited by a network’s security budget, which are the fees, rewards and revenue that are extracted from its users.  It’s in this light that one can see that proof of stake is a group of wealthy elites — a new breed of bankers running an inefficient database — charging high fees and extracting greater shares of revenue to make their time and efforts worthwhile. These elite insiders don’t want you to consider that security budgets and pre-mined income will be used to buy their own energy. Whether the energy is purchased for humans or machines doesn’t make much difference beyond feel-good corporate carbon accounting. The environment doesn’t care about accounting tricks.  Ethereum’s low energy bill is a diversion from what its security budget is spent on. It is an ESG sleight of hand — a ruse on the gullible and environmentally conscious. You’ll pay high fees to move your money and Ethereum’s elite will rake in profits to buy yachts,  and carbon-intensive services — laughing all the way to their own bank.  Security Budgets Are Energy Budgets  Bitcoin’s block reward will halve every four years — meaning miners will increasingly be supported by the fees users are willing to pay for open global settlement. Since Bitcoin’s  nature encourages savings rather than spending, Buterin predicts network activity and fees will dwindle. He doesn’t mention that miners would not have the funds to purchase much energy in such a scenario and would fall into an energy consumption equilibrium, just like every automated technology throughout history.  An Ethereum with a larger security budget than Bitcoin’s, as Buterin predicts, would enable Ethereum’s elite to purchase more energy than Bitcoin miners. Enriching proof-of-stake validators for energy degrowth will not help humanity progress or solve environmental problems — it only obscures the carbon-intensive energy its insiders will purchase with their high security budgets.  Rather than encouraging degrowth of services, it would be far better for humanity to focus on economically  for a future that will need considerably more energy as a greater number of services are electrified. If Buterin’s predictions come true, and Bitcoin’s power consumption drops with coin issuance, overbuilt renewable energy can be repurposed for other uses.  Revenues And Energy  Of course, one dollar of revenue does not equal one dollar of energy purchases — particularly when Bitcoin excels at sourcing the cheapest energy in low demand. However, even if all the beneficiaries of Ethereum’s pre-mine, high fees and staking rewards consume low-carbon-intensity lifestyles, the money can and likely will flow into carbon-intensive activities.  Visa, Mastercard and American Express combined annually  of the electricity that Bitcoin uses in a year. However, corporate energy consumption obscures the full picture. These companies pay employees large salaries — which are spent on energy-intensive activities — for a task that machines can do faster, cheaper and continuously. Traditional retail payments  and , while Bitcoin payments settle reliably every 10 minutes. The revenue that a payment rail extracts from users is a clue as to how many resources it really consumes.  If Amazon economically replaced nearly all of its warehouse employees with robots, critics might characterize Amazon’s higher energy bill as an environmental disaster. However, robots would be consuming raw energy, instead of humans receiving a salary to buy energy. It’s all energy purchases one way or another and there’s no way around that.  Bitcoin automates global settlement in a similar manner to robotization — trading energy-intensive human bean counters for more efficient and cost-effective bean guessers that have a more transparent energy bill.  As Nikola Tesla opined more than a century ago, the efficiency savings from machines leads to human progress and an . As efficiencies drive down costs, people have the . He believed it was imperative to keep humanity moving forward by enabling cheaper and cleaner forms of energy — a .  Environmental Problems Are Engineering Challenges  Corporate carbon accounting obviously doesn’t consider the flow of money from a company into its human consumers of energy. If it did, it would quickly become apparent that corporate-based carbon accounting  and there is no working plan to provide cheap renewable energy to all of humanity. Rather, the plan is for wealthy people to  and extract more money from users to buy more energy-intensive activities with their profits. That won’t solve real environmental problems and won’t advance humanity in any way.  The reality is that  that Luddism and degrowth cannot solve. Countries attempting to reach climate targets need to electrify their economies and . Approximately  and only one industry can monetize the least valued  of the world's energy.  Bitcoin is  that unlocks oases of energy in energy deserts, for future uses, and can . It has the  of any industry. Only proof of work can monetize , , make , capture  and unlock the power of the ocean for a billion people.  For those who revel in the wonders of carbon-accounting, only proof of work can potentially have a  in the next decade. Transforming waste into energy is what drives humanity forward responsibly. We need more energy monetization, not less.  Economic use of energy is how humans progress. It's also an indication of the value that users are willing to pay for. Groups that oppose Bitcoin’s proof-of-work mining, like , want you to believe that enriching a new breed of bankers will save the planet. They either haven’t taken the time to consider what it actually takes to incentivize responsible stewardship, or they have a conflict of interest with those marketing a Luddite myth.

"52",377,2022-09-21,"CryptoDaily","Ethereum, which was introduced in 2015, expands on Bitcoin's underlying technology by providing smart contracts, or code that functions on the blockchain storing and retrieving data. This development was crucial for the success of Decentralized Financing (DeFi) and NFTs, two of the main forces behind the current cryptocurrency boom.  With successful completion of the Merge, the proof-of-work approach that crypto miners used to compete to add new transactions to Ethereum's ledger and get rewards from the network is now defunct. Most Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now mined in dedicated mining operations, or ""farms."" As a result of mining's high energy use, several nations have restricted the industry.  The Miners Plight  The PoW approach, pioneered by Bitcoin, is to blame for Ethereum's exorbitant energy usage and has added to the poor public image of the blockchain sector. Ethereum's new method, which uses proof-of-stake, does away with mining and its associated high energy costs and negative environmental impact.  However, miners who have put a lot of time and money into the sector and depend on it are outraged that they have been deserted. They regret their decision of mining and want to stick to more reliable investments than ETH mining. Miners are now more inclined towards the XDCNetwork node in order to benefit from its rapid expansion and promising future.    While some argue that ETH 2.0 is still safe, a 51% attack is inevitable at some point. A small group of early adopters and founders currently own more than 51% of all ETH that may be staked. When these privileged few start manipulating the books, honest stakers have nowhere to turn.    To ""stake"" at least 32 ETH to an untradable address on the Ethereum network, validators now act as miners. A validator must stake more and more ETH in order to increase the likelihood that its transactions will be added to the Ethereum distributed ledger.

One of the core developers, who goes by the name Panda on Twitter, revealed the move, noting that its one year of existence has been marred with internal strife between the developers and the protocol's users.  ""Panda DAO has been online for nearly one year. We've managed to sidestep numerous market downfalls during that time. Yet, the real crisis we faced was dealing with management issues within our DAO.""  According to him, the project's management through the DAO became difficult, considering some users wanted a focus on short-term gains while others wanted longer-term sustainability. With the dissenting interests, the developer noted that not much could be done since the core team's powers are limited.  It is not uncommon for protocols to have internal strife, which is often times showcased as bankruptcy, as in , , and Babel Finance.

"54",1523,2022-09-20,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Dennis Fassuliotis, founder of South Carolina Blockchain Inc. and co-founder of South Carolina Emerging Technology Association, Inc.  Why, you may ask? For starters South Carolina is on the verge of a financial revolution so to speak in terms of building a confluence of support for emerging blockchain technologies that can transform our state.  That’s important because although the industry was recognized in 2020 by Senator Tom Davis (R-Beaufort) with a state Senate resolution, the pandemic forced the nascent state advocacy group to postpone its first major statewide conference. However, now armed with a four year history of Wyoming style legislation, , and funding from the General Assembly for the State Treasurer’s Office to assess the role of digital currency literacy and emerging technologies for the benefit of the state, we have a clear direction and high-speed rail heading into the station via the member driven  (SCETA). The SCETA Bitcoin-centric education and policy initiative  is planned for the first week of October, and State Treasurer Curtis Loftis will be one of several noteworthy speakers to share their visions about how digital currency education, Bitcoin policy guidance and economic investments in Bitcoin can positively impact the Palmetto State.  Some may say that’s a lot of window dressing but not yet a first class ticket, or simply “Cool,” but here’s the next junction.  to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), our state treasurer and 21 other state financial officers opposed the proposed environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosure rule. Loftis also supports West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore leading the charge against big banks pulling back on credit for new  and other states where the needs of the state don’t quite match up with the woke mentality of stakeholder capitalism whose interests and goals often conflict.  Taking on financial powerhouses like BlackRock, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan may sound foolhardy — but not if you’re a Bitcoiner. Wasn’t it Jack Mallers who said at  that he can see a future where these dinosaurs become extinct if they don’t wake up to the open-source financial revolution? While the critics of this position may say this will cost taxpayers more money, I say principals are expensive. Protecting constitutional rights is not a dollars and cents or even a bitcoin and sats issue. It's all about the cost of freedom and freedoms lost today are gone forever tomorrow.  Since when did the cost of freedom outstrip the risks of maintaining the status quo or the mainstream movement? Tell it to the colonists that founded this nation and look back on the economic freedoms that created the behemoth banking industry that is at the heart of the decentralized financial movement. We can be critical of the past and how we got here, but redistribution of wealth in 2022 and beyond is about free markets, education and hard work, not handouts.  So for Bitcoiners there’s a clear path forward. Identify the states and leadership within them that already support common causes and court them as allies in the fight against woke politics. Let’s sync our narrative with state financial officers that have taken up the gauntlet to fight against the tyranny of stakeholder capitalism espoused by the WEF, the financial institutions that align with them and fight back together. This isn’t about proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake. Just look at the policy of regulation by enforcement being waged by the U.S. Treasury against open source projects like Tornado Cash or the overreach in securities enforcement by the SEC. As an industry, we are at a crossroads. This is about survival, not letting politicians or regulators pick winners and losers in technology, and thriving once we insist on having meaningful legislation, like , passed so we can innovate and maintain our leadership in world financial markets.  With that as a backdrop let’s take a look at another S.C. favorite son, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and his .  As a single voter issue there are not many other incumbent members of Congress that you may want to get to know from the standpoint of policy already aligned with Bitcoin. They just don’t see that yet.  Sen. Scott’s Opportunity Agenda is a rural economic development initiative focusing on 8,764 opportunity zones all around this great country focused on financial inclusion, quality education, bridging the wealth gap, empowering the innovation economy and balancing the scales of justice. Sound familiar?  Let’s court Sen. Scott and educate leadership on how Bitcoiners are working tirelessly to do the exact same things, not just domestically, but globally. Let’s all learn together from the experiment in El Zonte and Bitcoin Beach. We should educate ourselves on how Galoy has developed an open-source wallet to create a community bank with Bitcoin and provide custodial services for their trusted leadership to HODL their Bitcoin for their communities benefit and long-term wealth creation. Show them how you can transfer any amount of Bitcoin, $10 in sats or just one satoshi, instantly, with no bank involved. You can’t do that with Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, Cashapp or any other service today that isn’t the Lightning Network. That’s huge!  In South Carolina some of the areas where 135 opportunity zones have been designated may look to out of staters like developing countries. In a lot of S.C. rural areas residents still deal in cash and cannot get a bank account. In upstate counties, infrastructure left behind by the migration offshore of the textile industry are stranded resources, otherwise unused or underutilized as part of the electricity infrastructure that powered that industry. Facilities that once employed hundreds and even thousands are now warehousing, ironically enough, solar panels.  Let Bitcoin lead in those areas ripe for redevelopment with the mining industry in front. They bring hard dollar investment and innovation to any place they locate. The growing number of state associations should be supported by Bitcoiners and can work with local businesses to educate them so mining operations in these areas can pay local vendors in Bitcoin and create a flow of new bitcoin into the community while local high schools open their STEM programs up and develop #STEMFORALL curriculums with  -type programs teaching anyone that wants to learn.  And let’s change the lexicon a bit. Mining requires explanation, but when you first explain to a politician about how transactions are generated through a “digital asset data center,” (DADCs) they get it immediately. We can share the nuances later. We are in a race with well-established lobbying interests from banking to climate and they don’t care about your personal freedoms. DADCs form the base for a Bitcoin circular economy to develop in partnership with local leaders to break the chain of poverty.  Here’s a final thought. In both South and North Carolina we have political leaders that jumped on board the centralized model of data centers. These are massive facilities built by Google, Apple and others that have become household names that require even more natural resources and just as much electricity as DADCs. In a push to get more, both states crafted tax incentives to bring in more. But that didn’t happen.  Manufacturing incentives are still bringing home the bacon with industry flocking into the Southeast. Economic developers know they can add more jobs with manufacturing and give up less power rather than data centers but when these laws were written no one ever contemplated the production of an intangible asset and the pursuit after that industry. Think about that.  So let’s get this train moving. SCBlockchainweek is very pro-Bitcoin and just in time for the midterms, and right after that, presidential candidates will begin coming through early for the primary. There are photo ops, town hall meetings, BBQs, shrimp boils and established political strategists testing concepts in S.C. Why? Because it’s less expensive to lobby in South Carolina. Just about every whistle stop is an hour and a half from Columbia S.C., the state capital, and we pick winners on both sides of the aisle in South Carolina. Let’s run this Bitcoin policy bullet train into the stations that align with Bitcoiner values and impact national policy the old fashion way, as a ground swell of support that tells state legislators what matters to their federal counterparts, making it happen through the power of incumbency.

According to , the cryptocurrency went from $0.480 to trade at $6.73 at press time.  For its investors, this could be a sigh of relief since the breakdown of servers led to a  in value in one day. However, this uptick would have been impossible without applauding certain aspects of the ETHPoW ecosystem.  Stay grateful to the hash  One part that was instrumental to the price increase was the hashrate. According to 2Miners.com, ETHPoW’s hashrate had  28.34% in the last 24 hours. At the time of writing, the hashrate was 7.20 Terahash per second (TH/s).    Source: 2Miners.com  Before the increase, the hashrate had gone as low as 5.05 TH/s. Looking at other aspects of the mining pool, it was observed that about $15,400 had been paid to miners in the last 24 hours. With over 5483 blocks , ETHPoW miners had continued mining at a network difficulty of 388.3 Terahash.    Source: 2Miners.com  Coincidentally, the luck at which blocks were mined was the highest since 16 September. As for the block rewards, miners paid a transaction fee of $13.35 at press time.  Not yet time to jubilate  Despite the increase in hashrate, it is noteworthy to know that ETHPoW was still at a relatively low level as compared to the value it was during the  Merge. Crypto intelligence platform, Messari, took note of this development and highlighted some possible happenings regarding the ETHPoW chain.   Proof-of-Work fork hasn’t been able to sustain high levels of hashrate post-Merge. It isn’t likely to recover.  Without any catalysts for economic migration to $ETHW, the chain won’t be able to support a valuation that would make mining ETHW worthwhile.   — Messari (@MessariCrypto)   Furthermore, with Messari’s projection, ETHPoW may struggle to keep its miners as profitable as possible. Nonetheless, it may seem too soon to assume that ETHPoW is “done for.” As conversations continue to merge on the sustainability of the chain, ETHPoW looks like it’s concerned about developing its network.  Recently, the ETHPoW official handle shared a tweet that it had launched a new bridge on its mainnet. According to the update, the new bridge would support ETH on Proof-of-Stake (PoS), USDT, and USDC.  New bridge launched!!   Support for  Ethereum EthereumPoW.

A number of the comments were of the  that the new bridge could only bridge to ETHPoW but could not bridge back.

"56",942,2022-09-20,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Paolo Ardoino the chief technology officer at Bitfinex.  Ignore the avalanche (ba dum tsss) of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) tumbling down from large sections of the popular press: Bitcoin is here to stay.  A  conducted by Boston Consulting Group, Bitget and Foresight Ventures forecasts that the number of crypto users will hit one billion by 2030. The report pointed out that the industry is early in its adoption phase with “plenty of growth to come.”  Despite clear signs of substantial market growth for years to come, skeptics still question the effectiveness and sustainability of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a widely-accepted means of payment. Specifically,  has repeatedly come up as a major obstacle to its widespread adoption.  Bitcoin’s focus on security and decentralization limits the ability to handle high throughputs of transactions within the network in short periods of time. This fact is often highlighted by its critics, suggesting that without the ability to quickly process giant blocks of transaction data, receiving payments for something as small as a cup of coffee will result in fees that exceed the price of the beverage itself.  If Bitcoin is going to live up to its full potential and become a means of payment in an alternative financial system, users must be able to execute transactions quickly and at a low cost. This is where the Lightning Network comes into play and why mass adoption of the network is critical to the success of Bitcoin becoming a true option for everyday payments.  The Lightning Network, a second-layer protocol designed to facilitate micropayment channels at scale brings Bitcoin back to its original purpose as a peer-to-peer payment network by taking transactions off-chain and enabling them to be completed in mere seconds and at a fraction of the cost.  According to  from BitcoinVisuals, the capacity of the Lightning Network has 4,700.623 bitcoin in liquidity flowing through the protocol at the time of this writing. With the capacity of the Lightning Network steadily  over the past year, even in the face of a bear market, this growth in utilization proves that the technology powering these systems is still in its infancy.  Bitcoin’s Real-World Adoption Is Growing  Bitcoin has already seen rapid growth and adoption, even being adopted as legal tender in emerging economies such as  ’s and the . The Lightning Network enables brick-and-mortar shops in these countries to accept bitcoin as payment for Big Macs or frappuccinos, via mobile devices.  And the widespread embrace of small cryptocurrency transactions for daily goods and services hasn’t stopped there. Payments apps such as El Salvador’s  offer low-cost, high-speed transactions, and  in February, making zero-fee bitcoin payments available for its customers. With this widespread adoption, popularity has soared as payment volume on the Lightning Network . Additionally, according to a  from Arcane Research, payments on the Lightning Network were available to over 80 million people in March of this year, compared to only 100,000 people back in August 2021.  As more cryptocurrency exchanges integrate the Lightning Network into their platforms, the number of people that have access to low-cost, high-speed payments will only continue to grow, making the payments industry ripe for disruption. Even crypto-skeptical superpowers are taking note, as two U.S. senators  this summer to make small crypto transactions tax free.  But the benefits of Lightning Network go beyond making payments low cost and high speed for the daily user on the go. Some companies are even exploring how they can take this tool of financial freedom and apply it to protecting freedom of speech.  Protecting Freedom Of Speech With Bitcoin  True decentralization and financial freedom cannot happen without freedom of speech, communication and privacy. While the value of payments on the Lighting Network can be seen in its ability to extend access to low-cost, high-speed cryptocurrency transactions to more people, there is another important utility. Arcane Research’s report found that about 50% of the activity came from peer-to-peer transactions, meaning half of the Lighting Network’s activity came from quickly connecting individuals to each other.  As companies are utilizing Lighting Network technology, some are exploring its use for highly secure and private video conferencing or direct messaging. Much has been written about how big tech can harvest the data of its users and sell it to the highest bidder, making this space also ripe for disruption. By offering viable, alternative messaging apps such as ,  or  that are easy to use, fast, free and private, true decentralization can be achieved.  With wider utilization of the Lighting Network, questions surrounding bitcoin’s price viability and its scalability could be answered promptly. Additionally, as cryptocurrency builders are innovating and coming up with ways to further utilize this technology, the Lighting Network could very well be the solution to protecting not just financial freedom, but freedom of speech as well. With cryptocurrency on track to reach one billion users by 2030, the proliferation of the Lighting Network bears watching as more countries and companies make use of its ability to quickly process data at a low cost to the consumer.

They empower innovators and project developers through access to funding, community and partnership building, and a complete support system to help bring premier blockchain games, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and metaverses to its community through events called IGOs (Initial Gaming offering) and INOs (Initial NFTs offering).  Seedify has successfully launched over 50 IGO projects and has now entered the NFT space with an NFT launchpad and marketplace that will attract new members and a new stream of revenue-generating opportunities to its community. They are focused on two verticals, Blockchain Gaming and Metaverse, each with utility based NFTs and tokens, which are imperative for sustainability, utility, useability and growth.  Last month Seedify successfully launched its native NFT token, $SNFTS, via an airdrop which reached almost 60x (at its all-time high). Over 1000+ holders have chosen to farm or stake their $SNFTS, earning passive income. Furthermore, most of them have chosen the 180 days staking pool showing confidence in the long-term performance of the token.  In addition, they are now bridging the Metaverse with the recent reveal of its own Profile Picture (PFP) Steampunked-themed Avatar NFT Collection. PFP’s are one of the most popular types of NFTs, usually showcased as profile pictures on social media.  Seedify Meta Studios is the creative powerhouse behind this exclusive collection. The in-house multidisciplinary team brings together the industry’s best and strongest talent, who have stretched their creative abilities to create a unique collection with intriguing characters, impressive utilities and a captivating storyline.  The Meta Studios team consists of 2D and 3D Concept Artists, Art Directors, Technical Artists, Game Developers and Designers from renowned AAA and Indie game development studios.  The AVATARS:  The unique set of 2D collectable NFTs will be limited to 10 000 items, with various looks, traits, and wearables. In time, the collection will be interoperable between metaverses and evolve to 3D game-ready avatars. Their visual attributes incorporate intricate details inspired by the vintage steampunk look.  Characters include Merchants, Steam Engineers, Alchemists, Tinkerers, Blacksmiths and Crafters, to name but a few.  The Narrative:  The AVATARS are people who have mastered using gadgetry, metal, steam power and pieced-together machines in their everyday lives. Their love for machines, alchemy, magic, and dreams of time travel united their purpose and broadened their vision and aspirations.  Enlightened from their inner being, everything they touched turned to gold, and time had no boundaries as they explored the past, present and future. They were born to engineer, craft, and create something new, something different.  Their curiosity became their sail; their understanding became their ships; their wisdom became their anchor. Nations gathered from every race and creed; this gave rise to a new empire built on imagination, dune, sand, and clay.  But among them, some infused themselves with a mystical resource called Amé. There were only 1000 of them in the beginning, and they were distinct from the rest as their resemblance became blue and their powers became unmatched.  The rest underwent the infusion process, patiently awaiting their transformations. These transformations would solidify their place in the metaverse and equip them for future adventures.  The AVATAR utilities:  What makes the collection so distinctive is the staking system for the NFTs called “Race Transfusions” and “Amé Infusions” these will essentially alter the AVATARS metadata and traits and will forever upgrade their look, making the AVATAR more valuable and rarer.  In addition, these systems won’t generate additional NFTs to ensure that the collection is not diluted, and its value is secured.  The collection will also include future drops with special utilities embedded through the transfusions and infusions staking system bringing even more value to those owning a piece of the collection.  How to get access to Seedify’s Avatar NFT Collection:  There are three ways to have a chance at owning one of the 10,000 NFT avatars:  * Staking and Farming:  * Stake 500k $SNFTS or farm 250k $SNFTS with the $SFUND pair to generate 1 Avatar raffle ticket each month. Those who stake and/or farm more will increase their chances of earning more raffle tickets each month.  * Seedify will take two snapshots, one on the 26th of September and another in October. Holders will be able to win a maximum of 1 Seedify Avatar per wallet during these snapshots’ phases (A total of 4500 Avatar whitelists will be available)  * Seedify NFT Launchpad:  Both $SFUND and $SNFTS will allow users to earn a chance for a whitelist spot. In addition, holders will be able to win x1 Seedify Avatar per wallet during the launchpad phase (A total of 3000 Avatar whitelists will be available).  * The admission list:  This will be specific to thought leaders, influencers, professional gamers, and partners who will provide value to the efforts of the Metaverse Seedify is building. Selections will be made according to different qualifications on a case-by-case basis (1500 whitelists will be available).  The remaining 1000 Avatars (10%) will be kept for treasury, marketing collaborations after the mint phase, team incentives, and creating budgets for future drops.  Seedify is stretching boundaries and positioning itself as the pioneer of innovation in the era of the Metaverse. They will continue to reveal more story parts within the collection, with new concepts and exciting utilities to enhance the value of their tokens to their communities.  About Seedify:  Seedify is a Blockchain Gaming, NFT and Metaverse incubator and launchpad, empowering innovators and project developers with access to funding, community building, marketing and a high calibre partnership network, with a complete support system to help bring premier games, NFTs and Metaverse projects to our community.

"59",357,2022-09-20,"Blockchain.News","Fred Thiel, the Chief Executive Officer of Bitcoin mining firm Marathon Digital, has called on the Federal Government to incentivize miners to embrace renewable energy options to mine their cryptocurrencies.  Thiel's comments come in an interview following the release of a report by the US government on the environmental implications of Bitcoin mining.  Known for running a mining outfit with a knack for proper and targeted transition into clean energy, Thiel said the incentivization model would arguably help stir the willingness of stakeholders to embrace clean energy.  Using his company as an example, Thiel noted that ""unlike other miners who may be on the grid just sucking energy off the grid in competition with consumers, we do it behind the meter."" According to him, this relationship is ""more symbiotic to the grid versus parasitic.""  The clamour behind the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining comes off as a major regulatory push for most governments worldwide. The subject is held as a major concern that the Chinese government has banned every mining and crypto-related activity, causing a tectonic shift in the mining and broader crypto ecosystem in mid-2021.  With a 'responsible' shift away from the environmental concerns of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, one of Ethereum's reasons for transitioning into the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model  is that when out last week. Thiel's recommendation, if taken, may help to nudge miners, particularly the established ones operating in the US, to invest in clean energy.  ""If you provide an incentive for miners to co-locate behind the mediator at renewable energy plants, then miners are going to move there,"" he said.  To Thiel, the report from the government somehow encouraged stakeholders to look at the bright side of mining crypto with renewable energy.  He said this highlights how the regulators are beginning to warm up to the idea and importance of Bitcoin and PoW mining in general. While he acknowledges that full appreciation may take time, he believes the government is currently positively disposed to welcome sound regulation."

"62",842,2022-09-19,"CryptoDaily","Mainstream retail brands that jumped into the NFT bandwagon early are seeing positive results. Though NFTs have existed since 2014, their popularity skyrocketed in 2021, with trading volumes crossing $23 billion by the end of the year.  It was during this height of popularity that numerous prominent retail brands like Gap, Gucci, Dolce & Gabbana, Adidas, Nike, and others began embracing NFTs in a bid to prepare for the transition to Web3 and the Metaverse.  Underlining this successful approach, recent data published by NFTGators highlights that most of these brands have raked in millions of dollars from their NFT sales. The report revealed that Dolce & Gabbana’s total NFT revenue this year stands at around $25.6 million, with Gucci’s sales reaching approximately $11.5 million, and Adidas’ comparable figure totaling nearly $10.9 million.  Nike dominates this list, registering more than $185 billion from its digital sales. The data further indicates that Nike has generated nearly $1.3 billion in transaction volume via secondary trading of its NFTs, which adds to roughly $93 million worth of primary assets and has so far generated more than $92 million in royalties.  Back in 2021, Nike acquired RTKFT - the NFT startup behind the CloneX NFT collection. Nike purchased the platform within two weeks after the CloneX NFT collection was launched for auction, making it evident that the brand is interested in expanding its presence across Web3 and the Metaverse. Despite weak crypto market conditions, Nike’s NFTs transaction reached a total of 6.362 ETH in August 2022, cementing the idea that consumers are becoming increasingly receptive to NFTs.  There are several reasons behind this trend of an increasing number of mainstream brands embracing NFTs. For starters, the NFT ecosystem has evolved from a technology-dense niche for crypto and blockchain enthusiasts to an ecosystem that is now more user-friendly and accessible for the average consumer.  The accelerated adoption of mainstream technology like Web3 and the metaverse has also contributed to NFTs’ popularity, primarily because NFTs are acting as the bridge connecting these futuristic ecosystems.  Additionally, from a brand’s perspective, embracing NFTs gives them an additional revenue source and helps them connect with customers - most of whom hail from younger, tech-savvy generations. Several brands have already showcased that NFTs can be a proven way to improve brand awareness, customer engagement, and brand loyalty.  Beyond Luxury Brands  The good news is that this adoption isn’t just limited to mainstream brands. Several emerging blockchain projects are continuously unlocking new use cases, some of which can help lay the foundation for bigger brands to experiment further with NFTs.  Take, for instance, the case of the blockchain startup RSK (Rootstock Network). The startup recently announced that its partner, WakeUp Labs, has signed a long-term strategic collaboration with another climate-tech startup, Kilimo, to introduce the concept of “water neutrality” NFTs.  WakeUp Labs is an environmental-friendly protocol built on top of RSK. In partnership with Kilimo, WakeUp Labs will help verify the water consumption of agriculture-based businesses.  Through this tie-up, WakeUp will supply the required infrastructure to issue tokenized certificates (known as “Verification NFTs”) to all agricultural businesses and organizations that have established responsible water consumption models.  Each participant’s water savings will be reflected as an exclusive NFT minted on top of RSK. Accordingly, other businesses and organizations can purchase these NFTs to compensate Kilimo’s clients for contributing to reduced water consumption. Simply put, this model unlocks an additional revenue stream for agricultural businesses, organizations, and individuals who use water efficiently.  Another emerging solution that aims to unlock a new use case for NFTs is BridgeChamp. This play-to-earn game built on Jelurida’s Ardor blockchain leverages Jelurida’s unique parent chain-child chain architecture. The BridgeChamp team is currently working on adding more utility to its in-game rewards and NFTs by partnering with merchant stores, outlets, and other retail brands.  BridgeChamp is the first platform to facilitate on-chain bridge play. It has built an ecosystem where players can play casually and competitively. Players can also create or join tournaments, host competitions, practice their skills, and much more. The platform has integrated a real-world bridge play experience with blockchain technology, ensuring that anyone can access it from both mobile devices and web browsers.  It is important to note that, unlike other blockchain games that are deployed on top of the chain or a side chain, BridgeChamp is a native blockchain that operates as the child-chain of Ardor. Since child chains may have a few limitations, it also uses Jelurida’s Ignis blockchain as the parent chain to remove all limitations that Ardor exhibits. This approach essentially grants both developers and users access to all features that must be tailored specifically to meet real-world bridge gaming standards.

"63",385,2022-09-19,"Blockchain.News","According to the report issued on Thursday September 15, Ethereum's energy usage and carbon footprint have both dropped even more than anticipated after the Merger upgrade .  The report said Ethereum now uses approximately 99.99% less energy after the merge was completed. It further mentioned that the blockchain's carbon footprint has also fallen by over 99.99%.  In the past, the Ethereum Foundation estimated that the merge would cut the network's energy consumption by approximately 99.95%.  The CCRI report disclosed that Ethereum's overall electricity consumes just 2,600-megawatt hours per year, compared to 23 million megawatt hours before the merge. As a result, Ethereum's estimated annual CO2 emissions have fallen from over 11 million tons to just under 870 less than the combined total of 100 average American homes, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  In a statement yesterday, Uli Gallersd rfer, CCRI co-founder and CEO, said that Ethereum's green credentials are now at par with other energy-efficient blockchain networks that started with a proof-of-stake consensus model, rather than transitioning to it as Ethereum just did.  However, Ethereum's move to proof of stake (PoS) consensus model has not gone well with some industry stakeholders. Ethereum miners, who used to run powerful computers to secure the network and earn ETH rewards through mining, have moved on to mine cryptocurrency on other networks.  Miners have moved their powerful rigs to  like Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ravencoin (RVN), and Ergo (ERG) to do mining.  Why the Merge Is Important  Ethereum's switch to  has been planned since 2014, before the official deployment of the blockchain. Due to its technical complexity and the increasingly large amount of money at risk, the upgrade has been delayed several times.

A fact sheet describing the steps taken to regulate the cryptocurrency industry was made public by the White House on Friday. Despite prior requests for a uniform regulatory framework, stakeholders in the industry have criticized the recently implemented plan, pointing out its many flaws.  The framework intends to ""Protect Consumers, Investors, Businesses, Financial Stability, National Security, and the Environment,"" according to the White House report. However, U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry  that the plan is lacking in a number of crucial respects.  McHenry claims that the White House reports are an unacceptable surrogate for true ""legislative clarity."" He further highlighted that the reports concentrate on the risks that digital assets pose rather than recognizing their critical contribution to fostering innovation in the United States.  Besides McHenry, the Blockchain Association  the Biden Administration's regulatory stance. According to Kristin Smith, Executive Director of the Blockchain Association, the United States has lost a chance to solidify its position as a worldwide leader in the cryptocurrency industry with this strategy.  Like McHenry, Smith mentioned that the reports lost sight of opportunities and moved their attention to crypto risks, skipping a chance to offer suggestions for promoting innovation in the industry.  ""This is surprising given the clear instructions from the [executive order] and work from members of Congress to move things forward,"" Warren added. Additionally, U.S. Senator Patrick Toomey said reports are not a sufficient substitute for actual regulatory measures.  The U.S. is ramping up crypto regulatory measures  Notwithstanding, a few industry experts have expressed satisfaction with the recently published reports. Ben Gray, General Counsel at FinTech firm Paxos Trust Company, commended the U.S. government. Gray noted his pleasure in the fact that the government is putting in efforts to make sure related agencies are enforcing the proper rules.  Cryptocurrency advocate U.S. Representative Jim Himes applauded the Biden Administration for the move. Himes expressed his delight in the fact that there is at least a move towards proper cryptocurrency regulation.  The nine reports came 6 months following President Biden's executive order. The order that the president signed in March received several commendations from industry players. These recent reports have fallen short of the expectations of the broader crypto community.  The United States has recently ramped up its crypto regulatory approaches, as adoption sees a major spike. Nonetheless, the measures have met criticisms rather than acclaim. This is due in large part to the fact that major industry players believe these measures are likely to stifle innovation in the sector.  Last week the White House released a  highlighting the environmental concerns of crypto mining. In response, founder of MicroStrategy and Bitcoin maximalist, Michael Saylor noted that the reports are aimed at undermining Bitcoin. Saylor said the report is ""full of misinformation generated and promulgated by unscrupulous crypto promoters."""

In terms of banks, Bank of America Corp. comes in at No. 5, Citigroup Inc. at No. 15 and Wells Fargo & Co. at a hilarious No. 25 considering the  that they got slapped for just a few years ago. The most ironic part is how any of these companies made the list at all. U.S.-based banks alone have racked up a stunning  over the past 20 years.

I don’t know about you, but this doesn’t feel very “equitable and inclusive.”  Bitcoin is a permissionless, peer-to-peer value transfer network with increasing functionality on its growing stack of application layers. It has a native asset, undilutable by nation-states and resistant to seizure and censorship.  It banks the unbanked and it banks the debanked, protecting them from the ravages of global hyperinflation — a phenomenon that those in the developing world know far too well.  Bitcoin has no agenda, no values to force upon its user base as a means to appease the capital allocation gods from the likes of BlackRock. Bitcoin just is. Bitcoin just does. Without judgment, without discrimination, without redlining, without opening fake accounts on your behalf, without paying billions of dollars in fines every year, without giving you diabetes or censoring your search results.  Bitcoin is rules without rulers — where everyone is treated equally, because there’s no way to do anything but. Bitcoin is socially responsible money.  This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

Following Ethereum’s transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake – an event known as  – the network will use 99.95% less energy compared to before, according to the Ethereum Foundation. Additionally, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also  a claim on Thursday saying “the Merge will reduce worldwide electricity consumption by 0.2%.”  , by comparison, continues to rely on the much more energy-intensive proof-of-work system as its consensus mechanism.  Not surprisingly, the promise of significantly lower energy usage by Ethereum is attractive to ESG investors, who consider it important to reduce energy use and – in particular – carbon emissions.  According to Conor Svensson, CEO and Founder of Web3 Labs, the switch to proof-of-stake for Ethereum could even make Bitcoin and other networks that remain on proof-of-work appear less attractive to these investors.  “If you’re a corporate looking to invest in cryptocurrencies, given the ESG narrative I imagine a lot of them will be slightly hesitant about getting exposure to Bitcoin when there’s this other asset which doesn’t use huge amounts of power,” Svensson was  in a recent Evening Standard article as saying, while also noting:  “I do believe that Ethereum will long-term overtake Bitcoin.”  ESG is short for environmental, social and governance, and so-called ESG investing has become extremely popular among both retail investors and financial institutions in recent years. According to a Bloomberg on ESG investing, assets under management by ESG funds are set to reach $41trn by the end of 2022, with ESG-related assets now accounting for one in three dollars managed globally.  ETH is the world’s second-most valuable cryptoasset with a market capitalization at the time of writing of just over $173bn. And although some believe that ETH will one day overtake BTC as the most valuable cryptoasset, an event dubbed “the flippening,” ETH’s market cap still remains less than half that of BTC.  ETH fell in price immediately following the Merge, and was as of Friday at 9:50 pm UTC down 4.2% for the past 24 hours to a price of $1,435."
"69",404,2022-09-16,"Bitcoin Magazine","The White House has published a legal framework for engaging with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in the U.S. following a “whole of government” executive order (E.O.) from President Joe Biden earlier this year, per an .  The  E.O. called on government agencies to produce varying forms of research regarding consumer privacy and protection, energy usage, and central bank digital currency (CBDC) benefits and risks.  In accordance with the research provided, the White House intends to empower the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to “aggressively pursue investigations” in the digital asset space.  Additionally, Biden’s administration will push the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to “redouble their efforts to monitor” the ecosystem as it relates to “unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices.”  However, it is unclear what enables the determination of whether or not these agencies will begin monitoring for the aforementioned malicious behavior.  Continuing on, the framework also calls on agencies to begin accepting “instant payment systems,” such as FedNow and the consideration of regulating non bank payment providers.  Furthermore, the National Science Foundation (NSF) will research “technical and socio-technical disciplines and behavioral economics” in order to understand digital asset ecosystems.  Following a recent report from the White House  (OSTP), the Department of Energy (DoE) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are being tasked with “tracking digital assets’ environmental impacts; developing performance standards as appropriate; and providing local authorities with the tools, resources, and expertise to mitigate environmental harms.”  In addition, the Bank Secrecy Act will be amended to apply to digital assets, leading to larger fines for unlicensed money transfers and stricter enforcement against digital asset service providers.  Also, the U.S. Treasury department will complete a risk assessment as it relates to decentralized finance (De-Fi).  Finally, Biden’s administration has developed “Policies for a U.S. CBDC System,” which details the government’s priorities as it relates to the release of a digital dollar. However, the release states that “further research is needed”.  Agencies that were chosen to lead the ongoing working group for the research and possible development of a CBDC include the Federal Reserve, the National Economic Council, the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and the Treasury Department."
"70",405,2022-09-16,"U.Today","led the decline in digital assets after its historic ""Merge"" upgrade devolved into what some market analysts dubbed a ""sell-the-news"" event.  The second largest cryptocurrency by market value was down 7.36% to $1,473 at the time of publication, marking its greatest daily loss since Aug. 26. The largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (BTC), was down only approximately 1.63% on the day.  A significant amount of ETH moved onto exchanges leading up to the merge.  Was it to let exchanges deal with any technical issues? Or to dump?   — Willy Woo (@woonomic)   According to crypto analyst , significant amounts of ETH arrived on exchanges ahead of the Merge event —often taken as a sign that holders are getting ready to dump.  Data from cryptocurrency futures markets reveals that many investors appear to have closed out hedged positions in the hours following the Merge, indicating that they tied up deals they had placed over the previous month or recent weeks to speculate on the event's potential outcomes. The hype surrounding the Merge is now over, but Ethereum will now need another short-term catalyst.    Ads  Ethereum risks further 31% drop   | You don't want  to dip below $1,460 because it could trigger a sell-off that sends it to $1,000.   — Ali (@ali_charts)   According to Crypto analystAli Martinez, Ethereum might risk a further drop to $1,000, which represents a 31% decline from current prices in the event of a decisive break beneath the $1,460 support.  Ahead of the Merge,  reported that a futures and options backward movement after September indicated that a ""sell-the-news"" assumption was in play ahead of the event. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode also highlighted the fact that futures traders were pricing ETH at a discount post-Merge and were willing to pay a premium for downside protection. This is based on the relatively lower demand for ETH exposure via options after the Merge event.  Cryptocurrency prices have fallen this year along with those of other risky investments as a result of tighter monetary policy being implemented to combat excessive inflation. The Merge, however, is thought to be a longer-term driver for Ether because it boosts Ethereum's environmental image."
"71",761,2022-09-16,"CryptoDaily","The Environmental Working Group and Greenpeace have launched a petition to pressure bitcoin to follow Ethereum and switch to a more climate friendly protocol.  Environmentalists demand a cleaner Bitcoin  The Change the Code, Not the Climate campaign, aimed at getting bitcoin to clean up its act, has now launched an advertising campaign worth around $1 million, that will intensify its efforts to oblige bitcoin users and developers to make the switch to the more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake consensus.  Along with this, Greenpeace has launched a petition to demand that Fidelity Investments use its influence to make bitcoin follow ethereum over to proof-of-stake, and away from the energy proof-of-work consensus.  Michael Brune, director of the Change the Code, Not the Climate campaign, gave his view in the Environmental Working Group press release on the subject:  ""With fires raging around the world and historic floods destroying lives and livelihoods, state and federal leaders and corporate executives are racing to decarbonize as quickly as possible. Ethereum has shown it's possible to switch to an energy-efficient protocol with far less climate, air and water pollution. Other cryptocurrency protocols have operated on efficient consensus mechanisms for years. Bitcoin has become the outlier, defiantly refusing to accept its climate responsibility,""  Ethereum now more centralised  Now that ethereum has switched to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism it will certainly be a huge amount less energy intensive - around 99.5% less to be more precise.  However, what is the downside with this switch? From now on ethereum will be a lot less decentralised, given that wealthy players on the network can start to up their stake and therefore have a huge say in how ethereum develops into the future.  Bitcoin is unique  Bitcoin was developed to be the very opposite of this. The proof-of-work consensus mechanism is part of the very fabric of what Bitcoin is. It gives Bitcoin its super security, and provides decentralisation across the planet.  A Galaxy Digital report on Bitcoin energy consumption compared with the banking industry found that Bitcoin used a lot less than half the energy of the banking system.  Central bank manipulation  The fiat-based monetary system that has been in use for decades now is sucking the life out of those who hold fiat currencies. Central banks play god and print incredible amounts of currency, which has the effect of debasement and of severely decreasing the purchasing power of all those who use fiat currencies and who save them in the bank.  Bitcoin may be using a lot of energy right now, but it is on the path towards a goal of negligible use of energy and a green future.  However, that isn’t the main point. Even if Bitcoin did use a certain amount of energy, it would be absolutely worthwhile in order to give people a liferaft that they can use in order to protect their financial future.  Mainstream media has done its level best to besmirch Bitcoin in any way possible, and the environmental card is one of the very best it can play in the current situation.  The environmentalists have been conned  However, the likes of action groups like Greenpeace, who do such wonderful work across the world in bringing environmental issues into the public eye, should really do their research properly.  Greenpeace, the Environmental Working Group, and other organisations that are trying to save our planet must not be misdirected by those who are embedded in our corrupt monetary system and who would seek to bring Bitcoin down any way they can.  This code can’t be manipulated  Understanding Bitcoin is a long process and has taken many experts much time and study before they were able to see the absolute necessity of such an asset.  The Bitcoin code is a thing of beauty. It does not respond to any criticisms or praise. It just keeps on producing block after block, just as it was programmed to do. No governments or federal agencies have any say in it. It is the world’s last chance for an asset that can be owned and spent at the whim of the individual, without any interference from any person or authority. The sooner the world’s population realises this, then the sooner we can move back to a hard, sound monetary system.  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The Ethereum foundation states that the Merge will be “the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.” It will witness the largest platform blockchain move from Proof-of-Stake to Proof-of-Work. The shift has significant implications for the supply of the Ether token and the environmental impact of the Ethereum blockchain.  A common misconception is that it will make Ethereum immediately cheaper and faster. This is not the intention of the upgrade. It is a change in how the network is secured and is designed for scalability. There are no expectations from Ethereum developers that gas costs will drop straight after the Merge is implemented. More info .  The Merge will witness the joining together or ‘merging’ of the execution layer, Ethereum as we know it today, with a consensus layer called the Beacon chain.  What has many investors excited is the price implications of the Merge. The Merge is set to be a major supply shock for the Ether token. Since the network is now PoS, a chunk of ETH will be illiquid because it will be locked in high-yield native staking. There will also be a halving-type effect because PoS validator rewards are much lower than PoW miner rewards. The inflation rate of ETH is set to drop sharply. These factors combined with Ethereum’s new environmentally friendly narrative, layer-2s emerging, and the existing fee burn mechanism present bullish tailwinds for ETH."
"77",736,2022-09-14,"Cryptonews.com","As the Ethereum blockchain awaits the Merge and its full transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), a broader discussion about miners and their future has emerged. As things stand, the Ethereum blockchain market is incredibly fragmented. The Merge is expected to usher in a new era in which validators and coin stakers replace miners. Miners who have spent much resources on ETH mining equipment may be rendered obsolete.  Recent discussions about proof-of-work (PoW) mining and its benefits and drawbacks make it worth considering the market's future. How will mining change in the coming years, and what can miners do to prepare?  Here are a few trends that cryptocurrency miners should be aware of:  Renewable Energy Application  Although it may sound like a buzzword, the shift to renewable energy is gaining traction in the mining industry.  Mining rigs consume a significant amount of power. Large-scale mining operations employ thousands of miners at the same time. Much has already been written about the energy consumption associated with cryptocurrency mining. According to one , crypto mining consumes up to 110 terawatt-hours of energy per year - the same amount of energy as a small country.  Since Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin payments last year, there has been a broader discussion about mining and its carbon footprint. As a result, many in the mining industry advocate for more carbon-neutral mining operations.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the Ethereum blockchain's transition to PoS is environmental concerns.  One of the most significant trends in the mining industry is the shift away from carbon-based power and toward renewable energy sources. This pattern will likely continue, particularly as market participants seek to disprove industry skeptics.  Miner Obsolescence  Perhaps the most significant consequence of many coin developers' shifting to PoS is that miners may soon become obsolete.  It's an unpleasant truth. Many coin developers are abandoning the PoW model. Miners are becoming obsolete as a result of this shift. Stakeholders and validators have taken their place. This pattern is likely to continue in the future.  Miners will have to find new ways to stay profitable. But with mining becoming less appealing, miners' future does not look promising.  Increasing Hashrates  The hashrate measures the resources needed to conduct mining operations and secure the Bitcoin blockchain.  According to industry experts, the hashrate of the Bitcoin network will significantly increase over the next year. Chinese miners who left the space last year are expected to gradually return, moving out of the country to other countries that welcome miners. At the same time, new market entrants are expected, particularly once the market downturn has passed and coins become more profitable.  All of this means that mining difficulty will rise significantly, possibly exceeding the  of 248.11 EH/s, set earlier this year.  Reduced Margins  Miners will most likely have difficulty logging profits from their activity as mining difficulty and hashrate rise. However, this will depend on the Bitcoin price moving consistently over time. If this occurs, rewards could be cut in half, with competition eventually eating away at the high margins that miners have enjoyed thus far.  This means businesses that can keep costs low and use the most efficient machines will survive in the long run. Smaller margins will disproportionately affect new individual miners, potentially leading to the rise of mining pools.  Chip Shortages  Finally, there is expected to be a severe shortage of chip availability in the future.  Mining rigs are built with the same semiconductor chip used to build electric cars, mobile phones, and other devices. Since 2019, demand for these semiconductor chips  by 17%. Increased production of electric vehicles, tablets and smartphones, artificial intelligence devices, and other items has resulted in a surge in demand, and mining rigs are catching up.  Even though semiconductor manufacturers  at 90% capacity, supply has not increased to meet demand.  Because of this disparity, mining industry players cannot afford to make short-term decisions at this time. Mining companies will need to plan their operations at least a year in advance, place orders early, and wait the period out.  According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, the primary bottlenecks appear to be thin production capacity - which will necessitate long-term solutions. Chip shortages are expected to persist until those solutions are found."
"78",824,2022-09-14,"CryptoDaily","The crypto market is still recovering from a bearish hangover. Macroeconomic conditions, Fed news, and the crypto liquidity crisis have been pushing crypto prices to new lows. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), for example, have fallen by more than 65% since their all-time high in November 2021. The total crypto market cap presently stands around $978 billion, dropping 68% from its peak of $3 trillion.  The impact of this downturn has also been apparent in several projects, with some shutting down owing to weaker fundamentals. TerraUSD (UST), for example, dropped from $40 billion to Zero in a matter of weeks as a result of poor token design. Even Celsius went bankrupt after a major liquidation that was not risk-hedged. This has been the case with many others that were shut down because of the current bear market.  The ultimate reasons have pointed to weak fundamentals of projects, such as poor token design, overleveraged holdings, and a flawed product offering. As a result, the need to foster a more stable market has become important. It's time to quit riding the hype train and start creating products that are truly consumer-centric.  Providing Real World Utilities for Sustainability  Crypto bear cycles have been brutal every time they’ve come, wiping out a number of projects from the cryptosphere. They have been a stress test for all the crypto projects. The only thing that distinguishes the test survivors are projects with strong fundamentals. Now, the term fundamentals may be ambiguous, which is understandable given that it has different meanings for each project.  Even while the fundamentals of each project differ, one primary aspect shared by strong projects is that they deliver consumer-centric solutions. Crypto projects that solve community problems with their products or tokens are the ones who survive the most severe bear markets. They are the ones that bring back the faith that has been lost in the industry and community as a whole.  Exeno is one such blockchain-based platform that is providing consumer-centric solutions. The team behind the project states that “exeno started as a crypto-only online store for name brand products. We quickly discovered that the project needed deeper solutions and better tools to stay relevant. That’s why exeno coin (EXN), our native cryptocurrency, is armed with features that make it genuinely applicable in the world of e-commerce. We’re talking about a multi-chain coin with bridging technology.”  Exeno is entirely focused on developing real-world use cases that would greatly benefit consumers. “We create solutions that will make cryptocurrency a part of daily life. The period of abstract crypto projects without practical application is over“ says CEO of exeno, Tom Babiak.  Bear Markets: An Opportunity To Build Better  Bear markets have historically spelled problems for the crypto sector. As a result, relatively few people have explored the possibility of creating something great in such markets. In reality, bear markets level the playing ground by bringing real projects to the forefront that are devoted to their vision and objective. The market limitations enable ingenuity and commitment to generate long-term beneficial improvements.  It is during these times that entrepreneurs are free to focus on developing their products, communities, and networks without being distracted. It enables project founders to focus on technological advances by identifying the greatest use cases for blockchain and crypto. Axie infinite, for example, was one of the projects created during the 2018 bear market. The Pokemon-style game found its use case in gaming, where it became a huge hit making billions of dollars.  Another example was Compound Finance, a lending platform on the ethereum blockchain. It was built during the 2017-2018 bear market, which also pioneered protocol governance, and is currently worth $3.5 billion in total value locked (TVL). There have been many other bear market hits, such as Aave and Maker, which are presently valued at $10 billion and $7 billion, respectively. All of these show that bear markets have not only been dreadful, but also brought opportunities to build better.  Enabling a Smooth Transition from Web2 to Web3  Thousands of crypto projects have been launched to date, but only a few have survived long enough. Bear markets have done their part to rid the sector of bad projects while preserving the strong ones. The crypto sector desperately needs strong projects and visionary builders to make it reach the masses. “With projects like exeno creating real-world utilities to tackle community problems, it is an indication that the industry is progressing for the better. An ecosystem like this is necessary to bring communities together by solving their problems, thus making the transition from web2 to web3 easier” sums up Tom Babiak.

"79",2568,2022-09-14,"Brave New Coin","With the Merge just a day away - the crypto community is buzzing due to the implications of Ethereum’s ‘largest upgrade ever’. The network’s shift from Proof-of-Work consensus to Proof-of-Stake is more than just cosmetic. The transition to Proof of Stake is the most significant blockchain network upgrade this industry has seen to date.  The Facts   is a decentralized blockchain technology that functions as a peer-to-peer network that executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. Ethereum was launched in 2015 and builds on the original blockchain innovations first introduced by Bitcoin.  Both Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to exchange value without payment providers or banks. Ethereum, however, differs because it allows application developers to build decentralized applications. It is able to do this because it supports more complex, programmable transactions than Bitcoin.  The Ethereum foundation states that the Merge will be ‘the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.’ The Merge will witness the joining together or ‘merging’ of the execution layer, Ethereum as we know it today, with a consensus layer called the  The Beacon chain uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model that will replace the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) model that the mainnet currently uses. The switch to PoS will replace energy-intensive mining, and instead secure the network with staked ETH.  The Merge upgrade officially kicked off on September 6th with the Bellatrix upgrade. As Ethereum founder  “The Merge is still expected to happen around Sep 13-15. What's happening today is the Bellatrix hard fork, which prepares the chain for the Merge. Still important though - make sure to update your clients!”  It is important to note that the Beacon chain was shipped separately from the Ethereum mainnet chain and the Merge. It has been running independently and parallel to other assets within the Ethereum ecosystem. The Merge is when it will integrate with other assets within the ecosystem.  The Bellatrix upgrade prepared the existing Ethereum PoS Beacon chain to Merge with the Ethereum mainnet layer. The Ethereum mainnet layer is the Ethereum that the crypto ecosystem is familiar with and has been using since 2016. When the Merge is completed in mid-September, the Beacon chain will become the official consensus layer when interacting with Ethereum and the current mainnet will become purely an execution layer.  The Bellatrix upgrade occurred at Epoch 144896 on 6th September at 11:35 UTC. Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) represents the cumulative difficulty of all Ethereum blocks mined. TTD value triggering the Merge has been set at 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. This is expected to occur between the 13th-16th September. The way the transition is planned, the difficulty level of the current Ethereum PoW mainnet will increase to a point where mining new blocks will no longer be possible.  The countdown to the Merge can be tracked   The Hype  Leading up to the Merge, ETH has rallied strongly. On Saturday, June 18th, 2022 at 12:00 UTC, the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) ETH price was US$968.15. This marked a local bottom. While the ELX is aggregated on some exchanges the ETH price fell as low as US$880. It then pushed as high as ~US$2000 on August 14th, a jump of around 110% in two months. Since mid-August, the price of Ether has slipped to around ~US$1600.  It should be noted that in a wider context, the ETH price rise was not as idiosyncratic as many ETH bulls assumed. Over the same period, the price of BTC rose by ~29%, and the prices of Binance Smart Chain token (BNB), and Solana (SOL), also both rose by ~51%. Additionally, the S&P500 rose by ~15% as did the Nasdaq Composite. Notable is the similar price appreciation each of these assets followed.    ELX 6-month price trend.

Source: Google Data  A number of perceived risk assets had further corrections following a strong period of selling and price drops in Q2. This included equities and crypto assets. The wider crypto market was able to recover from the mass liquidation events of Terra, Celsius, and Three Arrows Capital. Ethereum’s strong last two-month price period was not purely driven by the Merge.  Triple Tailwinds: What has ETH bulls so bullish  The Merge is creating bullish tailwinds for Ethereum and there are likely three key factors behind that surge.  The Triple Halving - The bitcoin halving is pivotal in crypto markets because of the strong positive effect it has on the price of BTC. It occurs approximately every 4 years and cuts the supply rate of new Bitcoin in half. The halving reduces the rate of inflation and like clockwork, creates upward price pressure for Bitcoin.    Source: Tradingview user- BitcoinBearSlayer  Ethereum is set to undergo a similar halving type of effect with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The Merge is set to cut the emission rate of Ethereum by 90%. PoS makes securing the network much cheaper than with Proof-of-Work, and because of this, PoS validators are paid far less than PoW miners. Calculations from some analysts suggest that the inflation rate cut to Ethereum will be the equivalent of .  Bitcoin bulls generally tout the halving as a powerful bullish tailwind and often focus on investing around this four year cycle. If Ethereum bulls are right then the PoS transition will be 12 years of halving cycles in one single event. Some analysts have suggested that Ethereum will become the ‘first profitable blockchain ever’ post halving.  The issuance rate changes for Ethereum can be .  Illiquidity - With PoS, transaction fees from the B block are collected and then distributed as staking rewards to validators and delegators. The original proposer gets an additional reward for their service. Delegators are average ETH holders who assign their stake to a validator, who participates in staking on their behalf for a fee and offers a small share of their validator rewards.  A large amount of ETH is already locked into DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave for lending and market-making rewards. The launch of new native ETH staking rewards for participating in the Beacon chain will see even more ETH locked up - and it will therefore become more illiquid.  Currently, Lido Finance offers depositors ~3.5% for delegated staking services. Noted Ethereum researcher based on modeling, that ETH staking rewards will shoot up following the Merge. His expectations are that yields for ETH staking will rise to as much as ~25%, with his lowest expectation being that yield will be ~9%. The transaction load of the beacon chain is set to increase significantly.  Native yield means not having to trust a 3rd party protocol like Aave or Compound. Yield is a passive income and generates yield independent of market conditions. This may make ETH more appealing in trendless markets than other large-cap crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC).  Ethereum becomes environmentally friendly - The Ethereum foundation says that after the Merge Ethereum’s energy usage will decrease by ~99.95%. The Ethereum network is a decentralized, secure payment network for users seeking to send and receive money and relies on its peer-to-peer nature for its operations and cryptography. Securing the information and value stored on the network in a truly decentralized manner using PoW, it turns out, took a great deal of processing power - particularly as Ethereum grew. PoS is set to significantly lower the energy consumption and processing power required to secure the network, while at the same time maintaining decentralization.  Both PoS and PoW require the parties involved in securing the network to have ‘skin-in-the-game’.  In PoW, if a miner proposes an invalid block, the miner wastes time, energy, and money (investment in hardware). In PoS the protocol can destroy a validator's stake or ban them from participating in the protocol. With one model, participants risk wasting hardware and processing power. With the other, participants risk losing staked native coins.  In PoW, miners stake and compete with energy and hardware. Ethereum has grown to become a large powerful network that requires powerful machines with ASIC and GPU chips to efficiently mine. It may have initially been minable with just a personal PC but this is not the case anymore. With PoS, validators should always be able to perform their roles with an .    Source: The Ethereum foundation  From an investor's perspective, this is a major narrative win for the Ethereum investment proposition.  The environmental impact of Proof-of-Work blockchains is often a barrier for large investors. Corporations and entities like pension funds often have  and turns them away from allocating capital towards crypto.  PoS, while less decentralized, likely passes the ESG test with a better score than PoW and may mean large investors will select Ethereum over Bitcoin.  Bullish factors stack together  On top of these major changes to the Ethereum blockchain, because of Ethereum’s existing free burn model introduced as part of the , the supply impact of the Merge is set to be even more exaggerated. The drop in daily emission rates and the supply shock will be even more pronounced.  If ETH is being burned with every transaction because of EIP-1559, a chunk of ETH is illiquid because it is locked up in high yield native staking. There will be a triple halving effect because PoS validator rewards are much lower than PoW miner rewards. It appears somewhat inevitable that the price of ETH will rise as a result of the supply shock. This is assuming that the network functions smoothly post-Merge following the transition to Proof-of-Stake.  It is a misconception that the switch to Proof-of-Stake will immediately make transactions faster and cheaper. ETH will have a supply shock and the network will consume less energy but there is no guarantee that the user experience of Ethereum will improve post-Merge.  What is more likely to improve, is the UX of Ethereum due to the burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem that is being built to make Ether faster and cheaper at scale. The AUM and transaction loads of the big-4 Ethereum layer 2’s- Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync and Starknet will help with this.  Layer-2 refers to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that generally improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. One of the key advantages of layer-2 solutions is that they don’t require any structural changes to the base layer chain.    Source:L2beat.com  The total value locked into these protocols currently sits at ~US$5.1 billion. This is without any native token incentives. This growth in AUM has been organic.  None of the four layer protocols mentioned have native tokens, but they will in the future. When these tokens are launched, and there are more incentives to use the L2s, there will likely be more AUM and transaction volume.  The Beacon Chain is incomplete: Vitalik outlines improvements required  It’s clear the public is excited about the potential price impact of the Merge, and alongwith that there is a perception that Merged Ethereum will be the height of best practise and crypto consensus perfection. Behind the scenes, though, Ethereum developers are carefully studying the architecture of the new Ethereum - and finding it lacking, or at least falling short of perfection.  In a speech in early September, for example, Vitalik Buterin himself discussed at great length some of the potential flaws with the current Beacon chain model and how they may be exploited.  He says Miner Extract Value (MEV) re-orgs, while difficult to conduct with the Beacon chain’s current Casper Proof-of-Stake model, are still possible. Buterin explains that an MEV reorg attack “is basically an attack where the miner or the proposer, instead of creating a block that builds on top of the previous block, they build a block that competes with the previous block.”  He notes that with Tendermint style Proof-of-Stake consensus, which is used by the Cosmos ecosystem, it is essentially impossible to Reorg because of its single slot finality system. He suggests to “take the Ethereum Beacon chain and try to get some of these benefits by making it more Tendermint-like.” Buterin says there are also steps that the Beacon chain can take to negate the possibility of miners colluding to attack the network.  In addition, there is a fundamental issue with Ethereum’s PoS model. Ethereum’s consensus model is really a combination of two different consensus protocols: a ""finality gadget"" (called Casper FFG) that finalizes blocks after 6.4-minute-long epochs, and a ""fork-choice rule"" (called “latest message driven greedy heaviest observed subtree”, “LMD GHOST” for short) that governs the chain within each epoch. Buterin is not a fan of this dual PoS consensus model.  “Instead of trying to combine together LMD ghost and FFG, and having these two very different mechanisms and trying to get them to talk to each other and agree with each other, how about we use ideas that are already well known to work, which is basically just single-slot SW finalizing consensus, right? There are plenty of papers talking about it. There are plenty of implementations of it. It's something that everyone uses, it's a very well-established and robust concept.”  As well as Buterin, Web3.0 investment firm Paradigm suggests that Ethereum should explore an alternative PoS consensus architecture.  Buterin says another goal for the Beacon chain will be to “increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of running validator nodes.” He says that the cost of running a node could end up being extremely high if left unchecked.  Throughout his speech, Buterin suggests potential fixes for the issues with the current version of the Beacon chain he lays out. This includes the aforementioned switch to a Tendermint style PoS.  Towards the end of his speech Vitalik suggests that Ethereum devs have always known the Merge wasn’t to be the end of the road. “Making some modifications and fine-tuning and refining the Beacon chain consensus has been something that was part of the plan since the beginning,” he says.  It seems that while this week’s Merge will be a seminal event for Ethereum, its own creator acknowledges that more work will be needed to optimize the network's bold new consensus model.  This week’s transition of Ethereum to Proof of Stake will be the most significant blockchain network upgrade this industry has seen, and probably will see for some time to come. After the Merge takes place, the conversation around Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake will only increase, especially as crypto networks increasingly integrate themselves into everyday life. However, it will likely take years for these arguments to play out in the real world."
"80",1231,2022-09-13,"Bitcoin Magazine","Bitcoin’s total hash rate has hit a new all-time high, according to , only weeks after  for the industry.  Against a more challenging environment, miners are put to the test as to whether they can maintain profitability. Balance sheets are falling under stress as price remains mostly flat while hash rate and mining difficulty keep increasing.  A  started in the beginning of the summer as the bitcoin price took a deep plunge, . Pressured, most public miners who had previously committed to holding their BTC began selling their daily mined bitcoin to cover operating costs amid diminishing margins. Later, some would also start selling the BTC they had put in cold storage.  Bitcoin mining is a self-regulated market where players aim to find the cheapest energy sources and most favorable jurisdictions available around the globe in an effort to shrink costs and maximize profits. As more players join the market, it becomes more difficult to mine bitcoin. As difficulty increases, miners who were operating on low margins get flushed out of the market. To maintain 10 minutes between blocks on average, the network adjusts the mining difficulty to the downside, making it a bit easier to mine bitcoin and enabling other miners to join the industry.  With hash rate now making new highs, and a bitcoin price struggling to show signs of a sustained recovery, miners are facing a challenging environment.  “The big issue for miners right now I think is that energy costs have gone up while hash rate has gone up and bitcoin prices maintained low,” Fred Thiel, CEO of Nasdaq-listed bitcoin miner Marathon Digital Holdings, told Bitcoin Magazine.  However, according to Thiel, not all players in the industry are hit equally. “Those miners who are well positioned, well capitalized and can operate from a position of strength are going to benefit from this.”  Marathon, Thiel argued, is among them.  “Our models have been built around the fact that we believe that, for the balance of this year, bitcoin is going to grind along kind of where it is now, up and down a bit,” he said. “So, as a company, we plan around [that] scenario.”  When it comes to global hash rate pressuring higher, Thiel claimed Marathon is in a good position as its own growth not only cuts back on the effects of the new ATH but also contributes to that higher reading itself.  “We’re focused on growing our hash rate very significantly, from 3 EH [exahash] to 23 EH by mid next year,” he said. “So we’re actually one of the companies contributing to that growth in hash rate.”  The executive forecasts that hash rate will keep trending higher throughout the year as thousands of ordered but yet-to-be-delivered machines from fellow big industry players get deployed in farms across the globe.  “There were a lot of orders for miners that were publicly disclosed last year and earlier this year, so you just assume people are going to follow through with those deployments.”  The same can’t be said for small players, however.  “I think the people who aren’t following through tend to be the smaller miners, less well-capitalized. They have problem financing the purchase of the miners, or they’re in a position where their energy costs have gone a little upside down,” Thiel added.  Miners enjoyed a prolonged honeymoon with profits in the past two years as a steep bull market ensued for the bitcoin price. Racketing incredible returns in dollar terms on HODLed coins, miners saw their margins balloon as bitcoin touched new highs. That reality prompted many companies to leverage up their business and take on debt to expand operations, a strategy that went south quickly as the bitcoin price started to plunge. Now, with rising hash rate, even more stress is put on these miners.  Geopolitical Tensions For The Industry Heat Up As White House Report Hints At Ban  The new high in Bitcoin’s hash rate comes 18 months after the Chinese government banned bitcoin mining altogether, a move that cut the network’s hash rate in half as local miners turned off their machines and began relocating their operations overseas. As a result, the U.S. share of global Bitcoin hash rate increased sharply as the country posed itself as one of the main destinations for the outcast businesses. Kazakhstan and Russia also welcomed the machines.  However, the U.S., which according to data from the  currently houses about 37% of Bitcoin’s global hash rate, has itself begun to show some signs of hostility toward the industry.  Driven by energy consumption worries, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) published a  last week recommending that the Biden Administration ensure the development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large in the country is accountable to concerns over climate change.  In its over 30 pages, the document, which is the fruit of  from March 2022, argues that while proof-of-work mining can help the energy industry and the climate in some specific areas, its net impact to both is negative. The OSTP went as far as to recommend the administration and Congress to consider limiting or banning the use of proof of work in the U.S. altogether.  One of the positive acknowledgments made by the report relates to the usage of bitcoin mining as a baseload energy demand mechanism.  “You’re providing extra capacity to the grid when it’s needed, and you’re not really a parasitic load on the grid because you’re behind the meter, using energy that would otherwise be wasted,” Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. “If you position bitcoin mining behind the meter at a renewable site, you are incentivizing more renewable production.”  Thiel also highlighted that, given that it’s midterms election year in the U.S., most of the harsh language in the report might be purely part of political plays.  “There’s a lot of politicking that happens and some of this is positioning by politicians,” he argued. “I personally don’t believe that there will be a wholesale ban on proof of work.”  Though not impossible, it does appear that an eventual ban on PoW is very unlikely in the U.S. given the nature of its government compared to China’s, as well as the extent to which bitcoin mining is integrated into power grids and communities in the country.  However, were such an event come to fruition, the network would still be prepared to withstand such an attack. The same way the network didn’t perish when mining was banned in China –– the country with the highest share of hash rate at the time –– it is well positioned to show a similar outcome in a potential U.S. ban. Notwithstanding, the network might even be able to keep thriving in the U.S. during a ban, which is evidenced by the fact that there are still many machines hashing in China; according to CCAF, the Asian country still houses over 20% of the global Bitcoin hash rate."
"81",928,2022-09-12,"Blockchain.News","The upcoming Ethereum upgrade known as The Merge is creating a lot of excitement in the crypto market, and for a good reason. Wei believes it will be looked back on not just as the most important industry event of 2022, but as a major inflexion point in the history of the space.  The Merge refers to the fusion of Ethereum's Mainnet, the execution layer currently secured by an energy-intensive proof-of-work system, with the Beacon Chain, a separate consensus layer based on a proof-of-stake mechanism. Once complete, blocks of transactions will be added to the Ethereum blockchain exclusively via proof-of-stake verification, eliminating the role of miners and their heavy carbon footprint. There are many different aspects to the Merge which touch on all different parts of the crypto world, and it's only the first step in a detailed roadmap for the Ethereum described in shorthand as The Merge, the Surge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge . The upshot is that these changes will massively expand the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.  Like with any big event driving the crypto narrative, there has been significant price action in ETH on many exchanges as the expected mid-September completion date of the Merge approaches. ETH holders need to understand that this is not just a turn-key upgrade, but the beginning of a long-term process. That being said, one important outcome is that there will be greater interest in Ethereum from the financial sector.  The first big reason is ESG. The shift from an energy-consuming asset to an energy-neutral one is a huge deal for institutional investors, who are more focused on ESG factors, with environmental impact first and foremost. Concerns over the carbon footprint of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies (which also notably include Bitcoin) have been one of the most important obstacles to large institutions deploying more capital in the space. The Merge means that, at least in the case of Ethereum, that particular object will be completely neutralized. Second, the nature of the proof-of-stake mechanism will significantly enhance ETH's attractiveness to large financial investors by introducing a yield-like characteristic to ETH holdings.  To understand why, you need to know a little bit about how proof-of-stake works, and how it will be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain going forward. Post-Merge, Ethereum transactions will be verified not by miners performing computations, but by validators locking up (staking) their own money (in ETH form) as collateral to ensure that they perform the verification diligently and honestly. In return, validators that successfully add blocks to the blockchain earn monetary rewards for their work. In the Ethereum context, running a validator node will require staking 32 ETH over US$50,000 at current prices although the creation of staking pools also allows smaller ETH holders to participate collectively.  This new system, therefore, creates the ability to directly and securely earn a yield on ETH holdings. This is a big deal for investors, and it could prove attractive to money managers whose main concern is generating stable returns with good upside.  Finally, ETH staking will also provide a boost to the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The size and credibility of the Ethereum network will make it almost like the crypto world's equivalent of the market for US Treasuries. ETH staking will become a de facto risk-free rate for crypto, serving as an underlying rate which all sorts of DeFi yield-generating projects can be benchmarked against.  The Merge and future Ethereum upgrades, coupled with the development of Layer 2 blockchains that enable massive scaling up while inheriting the base layer ' s security guarantees, will result in a proliferation of infrastructure being built on top of the new proof-of-stake based Ethereum.  Based on the combination of all these factors, Wei is bullish on Ethereum and its ecosystem, and even more so on the DeFi space.  It ' s a great time to be building in this space , said Wei.  The Merge is about long-term value, not short-term price appreciation  A classic Wall Street maxim instructs traders to buy the rumour and sell the news. But investors should be wary of seeking short-term profit around the Merge event in September.  It is worth considering another significant crypto market event, the most recent Bitcoin halving . Every four years, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. The third instance occurred in May 2020 and was accompanied by lots of discussion about how the price would be affected. As it happened, the price of Bitcoin didn ' t change much in the run-up to the halving. Several months later, the next Bitcoin bull run got its start, powered by a narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold.  Similar dynamics could be at play with Ethereum. The Merge is not about the chance for a one-time event-driven price spike. Instead, it is about understanding the fact that it is the first in a long line of improvements that are going to upgrade the network and allow players in the ecosystem to unlock huge value by building on top of it. It will take some time for the narrative to catch up with events on the ground, and then for a meaningful inflow of capital into this asset to happen. But I am convinced that the future is bright for the ecosystem as a whole."

"87",1355,2022-09-10,"Bitcoin Magazine","On August 25,  hosted  at Bitcoin Commons in Austin, Texas. If you didn’t get to attend the highest-signal event of the year, this article is for you. It had the highest attendee count and retention rate we have ever seen — the Bitcoin Commons/Austin Bitcoin community event space was full from start to finish, and even beyond the end of the event.  Underground Citadel is designed as the best place for Bitcoiners to connect with like-minded people where they can build their own tribes. Here’s a little background on how this event came to fruition:  Building The Underground Citadel  We’ve all been there: you get orange pilled and you learn about a fraudulent monetary system. Then, you start to question all of the other things that you were lied to about. You enter a stage where you go down all different kinds of rabbit holes while also wanting everything to burn to the ground. But, once you get past this anger stage, you find that life can still be beautiful and you focus on creating the life that you desire.  The Underground Citadel is the conference where we discuss the solutions that help us build the life we deserve outside of the faulty system that we are currently in. We invite attendees to come and find the signal that stems from Bitcoin and learn how they can create that beautiful life.  Finding The Beautiful Life  For this edition of Underground Citadel, we started with the foundation, the basics, physical security and the derivatives of that — situational awareness, mental tactics and threat recognition. How to heighten your ability to be aware of your surroundings and how to counteract any potential threats.  We went into depth on the ultimate sovereign individual toolset, including survival instinct, deterrence/preemptive strikes, deception, evacuation, extreme focus and awareness, reality-based training, and perhaps integrating some medical training. In any dangerous situation, you want to create the mental model of appearing “big and strong” in order to deter any potential threats and be in the habit of “breaking your routine.”  We then segued into hunting. Some might say we’ve even regressed as a society, since most people nowadays can’t provide food themselves other than going to a grocery store, farmers market, etc. We explored the ins and outs of why we should hunt, what kills you should learn and why paying attention is one of the most important skills you can attain. Funnily enough, presenter Jon Wayne Taylor actually went on to explain how hunting is inefficient in comparison to domestication, farming and trapping. This is the case until, of course, you’re left with no other options. He later went on to explain why one should learn tracking, trailing, marksmanship and butchery skills in order to further your hunting knowledge.  Afterwards, we went on to home birth. This topic seemed to be the most mind blowing for Bitcoiners. We’ve had this topic in mind since the first Underground Citadel event, but weren’t sure how the male-dominated audience would react. We really appreciate the way Bitcoiners welcomed this talk.  We discussed why we moved toward not trusting our bodies to do one of the main things it was built to do. Why have we allowed the medical system to take over and numb women during childbirth? As Bitcoinersm we preach “don’t trust, verify,” so people should be doing their own research as to why they will or will not have a baby in a hospital and educate themselves on what is best for their scenario, but not allow doctors to scare them into having this beautiful experience under fluorescent lights in a stress-inducing environment. In the healthcare system, you are the consumer and you are the one who should have the power.  We then, of course, had to dive into flag theory and jurisdictional arbitrage. At this Underground Citadel, we dove into how Bitcoin actually enables freedom of movement and as a group of people who value permissionless money, we should also value permissionless movement. As of now, we are born into a nonconsensual monopoly and in a fiat world, we are unable to keep governments accountable. The money printer and greedy “leaders” are what control the world. However, under a Bitcoin standard, the people become the customers and governments are forced to compete with each other through providing the best services for the best prices.  But, until then, this is exactly why we focus on “investment migration,” the term we use in the jurisdictional arbitrage industry to describe the immigration programs that involve investment or donation as a basis for acquiring a visa, residency or a passport. This is why we encourage people to implement jurisdictional arbitrage or flag theory into their lives. At Plan B Passport, we define “flag theory” as a concept of limiting your dependency on any one particular state by “stacking flags” in jurisdictions that are beneficial for you in various ways. We like to apply a markets and capitalism lense onto the way governments currently operate and show how Bitcoin brought the jurisdictional arbitrage game to another level, which actually solves the lack of a free market between nation states.  We then had our very own functional medicine expert, Dr. Oubre, go over how to take charge of your health by unlocking your “discomfort” genome. I’m sure a lot of us have done some pretty restrictive diets trying to get in the best health when we could’ve instead figured out what we were missing from some tests and figured out what our bodies needed. He went over the five pillars of health: biological, mycotoxins, environmental (manmade), heavy metals and emotional, and went on to explain why you should test for each pillar. Biohacking after healing is much easier than before healing. Once optimized, you can then focus on reverse aging by unlocking your “discomfort” genome.  Last but not least, we had the quick-start guide to 3D printing your sovereignty. Just like with hunting, for example tracking, killing, and processing an animal is not your first choice when it comes to putting food on the table as it’s pretty inefficient, the same goes for 3D printing, It is an unreliable source of weapons, there’s a steep learning curve, plus going out and purchasing your weapons is much more efficient. However, it’s not something you need until you do, and at that point, it’s too late. When you don’t have easy access to water, you get a water softener, water filter, water delivery, etc. But, you’d only be doing this when you don’t have access to water. What happens when you don’t have access to water and also don’t have a solution? The same applies to 3D printing. When guns are no longer on the table, you want to know how to print them.  You don’t need a passport when everything is fine and dandy but you also don’t need some cyberspace money and censorship-resistant way of exchanging value until fiat currencies go to zero and you lose all of your wealth. You don’t need a second means of a travel document until your original way of travel is no longer of use and at this point, again, it’s too late. As sovereign individuals who are considered “preppers,” everything shared at Underground Citadel was definitely a step outside of our comfort zones, just as any other form of growth is uncomfortable. So our message to you all in regards to everything we covered is: It’s not easy, but it’s definitely worth it.

The staking service, according to the bank was in response to the demand from its clients, as many aims to gain exposure to the Ethereum protocol, especially now that it is making a transition into the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model.  SEBA said the staking service will be highly regulated and will come with a trusted custody service. The staking service will general rewards that can be paid put on a weekly basis, offering a new layer of flexibility, access, and comfort for investors who pitch tents with it.  The Ethereum merge is an anticipated and significant milestone for the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, delivering improvements for its users across the areas of security, scalability, and sustainability, said Mathias Sch tz, Head of Technology and Client Solutions at SEBA Bank.  According to Mathias, the launch of our Ethereum staking services will enable institutional investors to play a key role in securing the future of the network, via a trusted, secure and fully regulated counterparty. Our institutional grade staking services offer a comprehensive and fully integrated platform for earning rewards from investments across a range of leading PoS crypto networks. By launching support for Ethereum staking we continue to deliver our clients the cutting-edge technology that they need to stay apace with the rapidly evolving digital assets industry.  Over the years, Bitcoin has gained increasingly massive traction amongst institutional investors as an investment asset and a viable hedge against inflation. With Ethereum switching from the Proof-of-Work (PoW) network, investors may start prioritizing it in the near future as a worthy substitute for Bitcoin.  In anticipation of the PoS version of Ethereum through The Merge event, a number of mainstream players in the cryptocurrency sector have pledged support for the new chain with outfits like Coinbase staking services will be activated."
"91",525,2022-09-08,"CryptoDaily","The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy today issued a report that highlights the negative effects of cryptocurrency production.  The report has expressed concern that the mining of cryptocurrencies may have a negative effect on the environment, which might thwart the efforts by the United States to address climate change. The Biden administration has been involved in a heated debate over the carbon footprint of virtual assets. Critics have for some time now been raising concern over the amount of power used in crypto mining operations. Although it did not propose any specific rules, the report did, however, suggest that the U.S. must take measures to reduce emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining. The White House report also said that the federal government should collect data on electricity usage and collaborate with states and the cryptocurrency sector to establish guidelines.  Depending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals, the report said.  Government institutions such as the Environmental Protection Agency “should provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based environmental performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies,” the White House suggests.  The report further states:  Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining.  Proof-of-Work Continues Despite Energy Concerns  According to statistics cited by the White House report, the U.S. is responsible for 38% of the world’s Bitcoin mining, compared with 3.5% in 2020. Additionally, blockchains that support crypto assets now use up more energy than many countries, including Argentina and Australia. Crypto asset operations use between 0.9 and 1.7% of the U.S.’s total electricity consumption.  Although the report includes cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other tokens using blockchain technologies, the report made specific reference to one particular technology that is driving most of the energy consumption issues: the proof-of-work consensus mechanism which underpins the two largest cryptocurrency networks: Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Proof-of-work uses most of the energy that the crypto sector consumes. Fortunately, there are newer blockchains that have found different methods that use a fraction of the energy compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum is however taking responsibility for its carbon footprint and is expected to switch over to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism later this month. The highly anticipated Merge is supposed to cut Ethereum’s energy consumption by up to 99.95%.  But as long as Bitcoin continues with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and continues to be the dominant cryptocurrency, crypto mining could continue to pose problems for energy consumption.

"92",667,2022-09-08,"CryptoDaily","Over the past few months, the price of cryptocurrencies has steadily fallen. It has made some people worry and sell their tokens and coins. Some think this is just a brief slump and that the market will soon recover.  Top analysts forecast that Flasko (FLSK) will surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Fantom (FTM) as the most significant investment in 2022, giving investors a chance to restore their faith in the cryptocurrency sector.  Dogecoin (DOGE) investors rush to buy into the Flasko presale  Dogecoin (DOGE) has continued its reign as king of the meme coins. In addition to significant gains made over the last few years the well-known meme coin is likely to make another surge, however Dogecoin (DOGE) is not expected to do so until mid 2023. Dogecoin (DOGE) is still up more than 9% daily, even if trading for the currency has slowed down. According to information from CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin (DOGE) has increased dramatically since its inception.  From research, over 2.37 million investors of Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are now in the black due to that price change. These successful investors have amassed a total investment of $8.13 billion in Dogecoin (DOGE), which currently has a market cap of over $11.6 billion. Dogecoin (DOGE) investors have begun buying into the newly released Flasko (FLSK) presale.  Fantom (FTM) likely to trade sideways for the rest of 2022  Fantom (FTM) is a cryptocurrency that addresses sustainability and transaction speed difficulties. Its goal is to create quick, affordable and scalable alternatives for blockchain transactions. While Fantom (FTM) is still developing, it can become a crucial participant in cryptocurrency.  Virtual currencies have been in an adverse market for the last season, but we feel they have significant long-term possibilities. While there are dangers connected with investing in any cryptocurrency, we feel Fantom (FTM) has strong growth potential. Fantom (FTM) investors are unlikely to see any large gains until mid 2023 which is why Fantom (FTM) holders are looking at alternative investments in the meantime.  Flasko (FLSK) likely to be the best investment this year  Flasko (FLSK) is creating a marketplace where users can buy, trade and invest in NFT’s which are backed against the physical asset. Flasko (FLSK) will be focusing on rare, exclusive and vintage bottles of alcohol, which over time have shown a significant rise in price. Users will have the option to fractionally or solely invest in an NFT, where a user who purchases 100% of the NFT will be able to take physical delivery of the goods which is stored in a secure facility. These facilities will be audited to ensure the stock is correctly accounted for on a regular basis.  Flasko (FLSK) launched stage one of its presale where the price is currently trading at $0.015. The community has been growing organically and fast, having just launched less than a week ago and already selling over 20% of stage one allocation. The token price will increase within the next 24 hours. Top crypto analysts have recently predicted a rise of over 4,000% by the end of December, making it likely to be amongst the top crypto investments in 2022.  Liquidity will be locked for 33 years, the token has passed its smart contract audit and the team will be unable to sell any tokens for the first two years. Flasko (FLSK) will create many millionaires for early presale investors. We think this is one of the best investments of the year. You can use the links below to enter the presale.

"94",506,2022-09-08,"Cryptonews.com","Ethereum is in the final stages of preparations to switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS). This event, which is referred to as the Merge, is expected to have several benefits for Ether (ETH) - the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.  According to a Chainalysis, one of these benefits is that the Merge could trigger renewed interest in Ether (ETH) staking. This builds up on the fact that ETH staking is already highly popular. Over USD 30bn worth of ETH is already staked in Ethereum 2, making it the biggest blockchain by staked volume even before moving to PoS.  When PoS is introduced fully, staking is expected to become more attractive as users across the entire Ethereum ecosystem become more comfortable with leaving PoW behind and embracing the more environmentally friendly PoS.  Additionally, upgrades expected after the merge will enable stakers to withdraw their staked ETH at will as opposed to having to lock up their assets. This, in addition to an expected APY of 10-15%, will mean more liquidity for stakers.  These prospects, especially the climate impact reduction and anticipated return on investment from staking, are also expected to attract institutional investors according to the blockchain analytics services provider. On-chain data already indicates that institutional buyers (wallets staking more than $1 million worth of ETH) have been increasing steadily.  ""Taken together, these changes, starting with The Merge, should make Ether a more attractive asset to hold, and therefore to stake as well… In addition to increased staking overall, we’ll also be on the lookout for institutional investors specifically to begin or ramp up their Ethereum staking activity,"" the report said.  Risks remain for Ether post-merge  While these benefits are expected, the crypto community is also wary of the risks that the Merge could throw up for ETH. The possibility of a miners' rebellion that could lead to a split of the Ethereum blockchain, as well as the fact that dApps that hold more than $50 billion in users' funds could be in danger if the merge goes wrong are some of the risks that have been talked off.  However, Joe Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder of the blockchain company Consensys, has downplayed these risks. Speaking with , Lubin said that even if a hardfork happens it will only be temporary and that he expects the upgrade to go through without a glitch.  “I think at least a temporary fork is likely: there’s an opportunity to make a quick Ether, and there are a lot of opportunists out there. But I can’t imagine wanting to build anything, or put anything of significant value, on a chain that has so many things that are fundamentally broken and abandoned,"" Lubin told the magazine.  The merge, which has kicked off with the Bellatrix upgrade, is  to be fully complete between September 13 and September 15, 2022."
"95",368,2022-09-08,"Bitcoin Magazine","* Per President Biden’s , the White House Office of Science and Technology submitted its report on bitcoin mining’s climate impact.  * The report alludes to possible executive orders and legislation from congress to “limit” or “eliminate” proof-of-work mining.  * Some of the cited resources have been criticized for biases to certain industries and spreading misinformation.  The White House Office of Science and Technology released a  claiming bitcoin mining negatively impacts the environment and hints towards banning proof-of-work.  “Electricity usage from digital assets is contributing to [greenhouse gas emissions], additional pollution, noise, and other local impacts, depending on markets, policies, and local electricity sources,” reads the report.  The first section of the report serves as an introduction while also hinting towards banning proof-of-work mining, which is used to mine bitcoin, if regulatory action fails to influence U.S. climate goals.  “Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining,” per the report.  Next, the document explores how mining can affect electrical grids.  The Office of Science and Technology asserts that bitcoin mining facilities create added stress on the power grid that leads to blackouts, fire hazards, and equipment deterioration. The report also claims that bitcoin miners will raise the average electricity cost for local consumers.  “Depending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto-assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals,” reads the report.  Finally, the last section concludes that there are ways in which bitcoin mining can actually benefit U.S. climate goals, although this is a much smaller section.  “[Proof-of-work] mining that installs equipment to use vented methane to generate electricity for operations is more likely to help rather than hinder U.S. climate objectives,” per the report.

"96",380,2022-09-07,"AMBCrypto","Accounting organization, KPMG, released a  that commented on the current state of the cryptocurrency market. The report stated that crypto projects will continue to stay low for the rest of 2022. The reason being the Terra debacle and the Russia-Ukraine impact.  The report titled “Pulse of Fintech H1’22” stated that investors only put in $14.2 billion in crypto companies in the first half of 2022. Investors, on the other hand, had put a record $32.1 billion investment in 2021.  There has been a significant slowdown in crypto investment, particularly in retail firms offering coins, tokens, and NFTs.    Source: Pulse of Fintech H1’22, KPMG  The report further stated that the trend is likely to continue for the rest of the year.  “Despite the crypto space collapsing significantly since midway through Q1 22 due to the unexpected Russia-Ukraine conflict, rising inflation and the challenges experienced by the Terra crypto ecosystem, investment at midyear remained well above all years prior to 2021.”  Focus on blockchain infrastructure  The report further predicted,  “While investment in cryptocurrencies is expected to slow down further, there will likely be a continued focus on the use of blockchain in financial market modernization.”  Investors will likely move towards blockchain infrastructure projects in DeFi, instead of token and NFT marketplaces.  Reportedly, there will be a growing focus on solutions related to crypto compliance and transaction traceability as more countries begin regulating the industry. Furthermore, corporates looking for low-risk investments will also show more interest in relatively less volatile virtual assets.  The KMPG report further predicted that companies from cryptocurrency and other industries are coming together to address environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns. This means that as more conglomerates enter the crypto industry, ESG concerns will become even more critical.  Resilience of the crypto industry to be tested  Alexandre Stachtchenko, Director, Blockchain and Crypto Assets, KPMG France voiced his views as well.  According to him, some cryptos would witness a drop in their valuations.  The report concludes by stating that cryptocurrency organizations with sound risk- and cost-management strategies will survive the slowdown.

"97",1041,2022-09-07,"Cryptonews.com","Ethereum Classic has arisen as an unforeseen champ ahead of , planned for later this month. ETC coins are rising in value despite a generally flat market amid network metrics reaching all-time highs.  After a meteoric rise of almost 133% since the month of July, the Ethereum Classic hashrate surpassed the previous record of 28 TH/s set in April, as of Tuesday morning. The capacity of a computer or mining device can be measured in terahashes. Due to the increased difficulty and expense of gaining network control, a high hashrate is regarded a security indication.  Over the past seven days, Ethereum Classic tokens have gained 2.43%, reaching a high of $42.07 before paring back some of those gains. During the same period, futures contracts based on the tokens saw $27 million in liquidations, second only to ether and to surpass bitcoin futures, which typically see the greatest liquidations.  What Triggered a Sudden Surge in Price?  As a result of the , a hard network fork occurred, resulting in the creation of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. Ethereum Classic is a continuation of the previous chain, while Ethereum is the newer chain.  The wealth locked up on Ethereum's different applications reached $110 billion at its peak in 2021, making it the most widely used blockchain in the world. Conversely, Ethereum Classic's development slowed to a crawl.  While the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry has grown exponentially, applications built on this chain have only ever secured a little over $1 million at their peak.  Though the price of ETC did increase by a factor of ten over two months during the 2021 bull market, this was due more to the speculative mania that engulfed the cryptocurrency market at the time than to any actual increase in demand.  If the bull market fails to spark change, Merge is doing the job for it.  Key network participants have shifted their attention to Ethereum Classic due to The Merge, which will change Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus process to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.  The developers believe that abandoning the proof-of-work approach will result in significant cost savings, increased network speed, and less environmental impact. Ethereum miners, who are paid in ether tokens for contributing to the blockchain, will also lose their source of revenue.  Quick Update on Ethereum Merge  According to the Ethereum platform, Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, will undergo a massive revolution that will alter its technology and reduce carbon emissions by more than 98%. The ""Merge"" will improve Ethereum's blockchain technology by moving it away from the more energy-intensive architecture used by its competitor, Bitcoin.  However, the price of Ethereum's token, Ether (ETH), has risen dramatically in the last two months as a result of the anticipated impact of the change. The first phase of the Merge upgrade will take place on September 6, according to the Ethereum Foundation, and the second phase will occur between September 10 and September 20.  Ethereum will move away from the proof-of-work (PoW) paradigm, which consumes much energy, and toward the proof-of-stake (PoS) model. Despite their differences, both systems are used to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.  , an economist who runs the Digiconomist website, the migration to PoS is a step in the right direction for sustainability. He estimates that the energy required to mine Ethereum consumes approximately 72 terawatt-hours per year, comparable to Switzerland's carbon footprint. De Vries claims to be attempting to calculate the amount of energy saved by the switch.  He believes it is at least 99 percent right now. As a result, the ""Merge"" will have a significant positive impact on ETH prices in the coming days. Key network participants have shifted their attention to Ethereum Classic due to The Merge, which will change Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus process to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.  Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Technical Outlook  Despite a significant price increase, ETC has surrendered the majority of its gains and is now trading at $33.99. On the downside, the ETC/USD pair is likely to find immediate support at $33.25; a break below this level may extend the selling trend until the next support level of $31.55.  The leading technical indicators, such as the RSI and MACD, are now in the oversold zone, indicating that sellers are exhausted and bulls may enter the market. At the same time, the 50-day moving average is likely to support ETC at $33.50.  Finally, the Doji candle on the 4-hour timeframe has the potential to cause a market bounce. On the upside, ETC faces immediate resistance at $35.50 and $36.65.  A bullish breakout of this level, on the other hand, could expose ETC to levels as high as 37.85 and 39.35.

Introducing Lynqyo (LNQ) Token  Lynqyo (LNQ) is a new initiative that is still in its premature stage. While it is not the same as Bitcoin in terms of the overall project, it has taken inspiration from Bitcoin in terms of aiming for the same degree of success. Lynqyo (LNQ) intends to revolutionize society by applying the notion of Web3 and incorporating DAOs, much as Bitcoin changed the whole banking industry. Lynqyo was developed by a team of innovators, designers, and engineers. They are working on decentralized decision-making systems that compensate producers and fans in open tokenized markets.  The Material Economy System, commonly known as the Lynqyo (LNQ) protocol, is a decentralized system for discovering, analyzing, licensing, and distributing non-physical information. It is designed to use DeFi instruments to tokenize intangible material, governance, micro-DAO, and liquidity. DAO is an acronym that stands for ""decentralized autonomous organization."" A DAO runs according to predetermined rules when implemented as a smart contract on a public blockchain rather than managed by business executives. DAOs are decentralized organizations with all organizational regulations imposed by blockchain-based code.  LNQ dApp  The lynqyo dApp has a one-of-a-kind mechanism that ensures continuity and sustainability in the crypto payments subscription industry, with two structural payment alternatives. The first approach, ""push subscription,"" necessitates linking the user's wallet to the lynqyo dApp wallet.  For each subscription, a smart contract will be executed. A precursory letter will be made before each due date to ensure that the authorization procedure is completed and full involvement is maintained. Customers can also choose ""subscription staking,"" which uses a proprietary algorithm to lower subscription expenses. When a user's subscription expires, they may be entitled to monetary compensation.  Content Economy Protocol  Lynqyo (LNQ) employs protocols and techniques that enhance network value. Lynqyo Content Economy Protocol is one of these, and it is responsible for empowering users and releasing the creativity of producers all around the world.  This economic protocol monetizes non-physical content and generates money from LNQ tokens. Therefore, it will be possible to identify, evaluate, license, and share intangible material. The content economy protocol will enable governance via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), content tokenization via user loyalty rewards, and liquidity via DeFi tools.  How to Buy Lynqyo (LNQ)?  Are you looking forward to purchasing the new Lynqyo (LNQ)? We'll discuss how to buy Lynqyo (LNQ) if you're here. Purchasing LNQ is straightforward. First, you must create an account on Lynqyo, just like on any other website (LNQ). You can select your preferred payment method from the two options offered. Purchasing LNQ tokens through Coinbase gives you six alternatives. You can pay with any of the six cryptos: BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, DAI, or USDC. You can choose your wallet at your own will for the transactions.  The second method is to use cryptocurrencies. This allows you to buy $LNQ tokens in exchange for various cryptocurrencies, including those with minimal transaction fees. Following your currency decision, you will be sent to the appropriate site where funds should be delivered to complete your transaction.

"100",425,2022-09-06,"Blockchain.News","The report states that the crypto mining industry has the capacity to transform worldwide energy production for the better, contrary to what is normally viewed as social and environmental harm associated with the sector.  The paper provides four ways in which mining can improve energy systems in a desirable and economical manner.  First, crypto mining is becoming a catalyst for the development of renewable energy projects. Bitcoin miners have recently started buying the cheapest sources of energy available, renewable (wind and solar) sources of energy.  In this way, cryptocurrency mining provides an economic incentive to build more renewable energy projects and help minimize fossil energy consumption.  On the second note, the constant energy produced by the flexible, reactive power of Bitcoin mining allows the industry to give back energy to the national electricity grid when demand is too high. In July, industrial miners in Texas collectively powered down to assist in protecting the grid during a heatwave as part of a state-wide demand response program.  Such reactivity will be especially important in the coming years as the world increasingly transitions from flexible fossil fuels to non-flexible renewables. Thanks to proof of work consensus powering crypto mining, renewable energy sources are becoming profitable through leveraging the portability, modularity, and agnosticism of Bitcoin miners.  Lastly, besides supporting renewable energy, crypto miners have also begun to help make oil drilling a cleaner and more efficient process.  Oil drilling normally produces natural gas that cannot always be economically harnessed for consumption. Such natural gas is beginning to become useful for crypto mining. This, therefore, helps oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron, Saudi Aramco, and Gazprom, among others, to make profits through Bitcoin mining and also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the byproduct.  Over recent years, Oil field Bitcoin mining has been growing fast, especially in the United States and Canada.  In March, Exxon, a major US multinational oil and gas corporation,  to use Bitcoin mining for this purpose.  The crypto economy has demonstrated that it is here to stay, as a variety of interesting new areas for investments in the industry remain constantly evolving. Crypto mining is one such avenue for business profitability.  The rapid growth of the crypto economy is not only placing fresh demands on but also offering  for electricity grids. Crypto mining offers energy firms new opportunities to create new revenue streams, improve demand response, and  of the long-term renewable resource base."

Under the SEC's Office of Internet Enforcement, Stark's team was in charge of cracking down on securities fraud committed through the nascent but rapidly growing web.  More than 20 years later, Stark is now speaking out against what he views as a new wave of fraud associated with cryptocurrencies and blockchain.  According to the interview, Stark is a leading figure in a movement (a network constituted of major technologists, academics, journalists, and activists) pushing for a more critical view of the blockchain industry and the trend.  In the interview with Protocol.com, a U.S. media firm, Stark discussed what the network of crypto detractors hopes to achieve and why he decided to battle the blockchain.  Stark said the movement aims to bring some sunlight to all of the misrepresentations and fallacies of Web3, crypto, DeFi, NFTs, and blockchain and to focus on why such products are not a good thing.  As per the report, one member of the movement is the prominent software engineer Stephen Diehl, who was among the technology experts who sent a letter in June to U.S. congressional leaders urging them to resist the crypto hype.  According to the report, Stark has joined the first major gathering of this network of crypto critics, including Rep. Brad Sherman, Chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection, and Alex Sobel, a member of the British Parliament.  In the interview, Stark questioned hypes surrounding cryptocurrency, DeFi, NFTs and all other Web3. He said among the reasons for users to be sceptical of crypto are issues such as frauds, ransomware, and scams associated with such digital assets, as well as the systemic financial risk created by the underlying blockchain technology. ""Then there are the environmental issues related to cryptocurrency mining, he narrated.  While there are critics who denounce cryptocurrency but embrace blockchain, Stark and his network maintain that blockchain technology is not a solution. ""It makes things worse. It doesn't scale. It has all sorts of problems associated with it,"" Stark elaborated.  Stark refuted claims that cryptocurrency promotes financial inclusion, saying it does not solve the unbanked problem.

"102",894,2022-09-05,"CryptoDaily","GameFi, a combination of the words Game and DeFi, is an all-encompassing term. Blockchain-based video games reward users for accomplishing in-game tasks, enable them to profit from buying and selling in-game assets, and use many other methods to enhance and encourage gameplay.  Today, GameFi remains one of the hottest topics in the digital era, most especially among crypto enthusiasts. On top of this, the traditional gaming market is slowly incorporating blockchain technology that even conventional games such as chess and solitaire have received a 21st-century makeover.  Riding the First GameFi Wave  With GameFi taking the world by storm, it has undeniably become a massive gaming trend – revolutionizing the multi-billion dollar gaming industry. However, looking at the infancy stage of GameFi, it was a tad far from what’s happening in the present.  During the early stages of GameFi which was born as a crypto-related concept, the financial aspect of blockchain-based games was given the most importance. Indeed, most platforms were mainly tokenomics-focused, a concept known as Play-to-Earn (P2E). Creating games from the position of financial engineering as opposed to from a game developer’s perspective led to higher barrier to entry and to games that lost their primary entertainment value and felt more like manual labor.  However not all blockchain game developers made that initial mistake. Wemade utilized its long-standing experience as a South Korean game developer of over 20 years to develop blockchain games that best merge the fun and in-game economic aspects.  As a leading blockchain game developer, the South Korean game company has been developing games that provide an immersive experience to its players, from interactive gameplay to great stories and cutting-edge graphics.  Defying the Bearish Market  Aside from making waves in the space, the gaming sector is displaying resilience under the harsh bear season. With around 173 million gaming-related transactions, the blockchain gaming industry has subtly weathered the storm better than other niches of the market.  How so?  When it comes to traditional gaming, developers have the power to change or remove items as they see fit. On the other hand, in blockchain gaming, in-game assets (with real-world monetary value) that players have earned or bought cannot be taken away or removed by anyone else – even if the development company decides to remove certain features or completely shut down the game.  Therefore, blockchain and NFT gaming offer a range of new opportunities that traditional gaming does not. Concepts such as “Play and Earn” as opposed to “Play-to-Earn” give more control to players while emphasizing the gaming experience—making P&E games more attractive to crypto enthusiasts and players alike.  Leading Blockchain-based Game  MIR4 Global, a play-and-earn MMORPG, is deemed one of the most successful and sustainable blockchain games in the sphere. Just a year after its launch, it has already amassed more than 20 million accumulated users and $160 million in in-game revenue.  Originally developed by Wemade, the game utilizes blockchain technology to feature more advantages like creating and trading NFTs, staking programs, earning in-game tokens while using them in other games onboard the Wemix platform, and more. MIR4 has an open-world premise that capitalizes on a long-standing fandom of the Legend of Mir series.  In a nutshell, MIR4 lets its players enjoy the traditional gaming experience while using the advanced features of blockchain.  Starting at the Top  Wemade CEO Henry Chang has recently been making headlines, and for good reason. Since April this year, he has been purchasing WEMIX coins out of his own pocket.  To date, Mr. Chang holds a whopping total of 82,880 WEMIX Coins. His monthly purchase is proof of his sincere dedication to contributing to the sustainable development of the Wemix ecosystem.  Aside from sustainability, CEO Chang also highlights the importance of tokenomics in a game’s long-term user growth and retention. He explained, “A successful online game is fun but also has a well-established economic system, which is contained in the game.” Giving back power to the end user, he added “In-game economy coming out to the real world is innovative in itself but imagine what can happen when game tokens or NFTs can be separated from the game. MIR4’s game tokens, and character NFTs are not tightly coupled with MIR4. Moreover, blockchain, inherently, is separated from the game. MIR4’s game tokens and character NFTs, even though they are issued by MIR4, don't belong to MIR4. They belong to users, not developers, even technically”.  He further added that with 50,000 games being released every year globally, they cannot realistically all invest in developing their own blockchain platform. Thus, as Wemix becomes the default open blockchain game platform more and more third-party developers will be able to seamlessly onboard the platform, taking the blockchain game industry to the next stage.  While an increasing number of platforms are now moving towards advocating for more sustainable game development, Wemade has been proudly leading the space since 2018… and will continue to do so for years to come.

To make things worse, the mining industry suffered a major decline in 2022 amid the ongoing cryptocurrency winter. Following this, many big crypto-miners opted to sell their BTC holdings.  However, both of these factors could see a change in the scenario given the insights discussed below…  Spitting facts  NEW REPORT: How Bitcoin Mining Can Transform the Energy Industry  Bitcoin miners are uniquely flexible energy consumers that can help solve some of our biggest energy problems.  Powered by   Learn more in our new report:   — Arcane Research (@ArcaneResearch)   Crypto-research and analytics firm Arcane Research, on 2 September,  a report estimating Bitcoin’s energy usage and its potential to transform the energy industry. The report asserted that the mining industry could transform worldwide energy production for the better. Contrary to its frequent narrative as a social and environmental harm. The report added,  “Most people disregard bitcoin mining as just yet another energy-intensive industry, but there is one big difference: bitcoin miners are uniquely flexible concerning when and where they consume energy.”  I.e. BTC could have a net-positive effect on energy and the environment. But, is this actually true?  Looking at facts, BTC mining operations’ energy consumption did increase over the years given the sheer demand. BUT, the industry still registered a very small part of the global total. Something that many critics miss out on.  As per the graph below, BTC miners consumed electricity at a rate of around 100 TWh per year, accounting for about 0.06% of the world’s total energy demands.    Source: Arcane Research  Compared to other sources, the said value represents an insignificant amount.  For instance, look at the video gaming and gold mining industry. The former consumed about 105 TWh per year, whereas the latter registered around 240 TWh – ~2.5x BTC mining consumption. Finally, the paper production operation’s consumption spoke for itself.  In addition to this, BTC mining systems reduce carbon emissions as the world increasingly transitions away from flexible fossil fuels to non-flexible renewables. The report opined,  “Per $1,000 investment, a Bitcoin mining system reduces emissions of 6.32 tons of CO2 equivalents per year, compared to 1.3 for wind and 0.98 for solar.”  The graph below shed more light to support this narrative,    Source: Arcane Research  Did the miners (in exodus state or not) sense this sustainable change to mining operations? Well, YES. This is evident by the fact that Bitcoin Mining Difficulty saw its highest jump since January recently.  As per the previous report, BTC  in a  adjustment at block height 751,968. Also, the mining difficulty increased significantly by 9.26% to 30.98T.  The question remains…  No doubt that the aforementioned insights reflect conviction among miners, despite the bearish sentiment(s). However, miners’ profit still highlighted a concerning scenario, with the same being the case for a while now.

"104",3186,2022-09-03,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Taimur Ahmad, a graduate student at Stanford University, focusing on energy, environmental policy and international politics.  Author’s note: This is the first part of a three-part publication.   introduces the Bitcoin standard and assesses Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, going deeper into the concept of inflation.  Part 2 focuses on the current fiat system, how money is created, what the money supply is and begins to comment on bitcoin as money.  Part 3 delves into the history of money, its relationship to state and society, inflation in the Global South, the progressive case for/against Bitcoin as money and alternative use-cases.  Bitcoin As Money: Progressivism, Neoclassical Economics, And Alternatives Part II  “Everyone can create money; the problem is to get it accepted” — Hyman Minsky  *The following is a direct continuation of a list from the previous piece in this series.  3. Money, Money Supply And Banking  Now onto the third point that gets everybody riled up on Twitter: What is money, what is money printing and what is the money supply? Let me start by saying that the first argument that made me critical of the political economy of Bitcoin-as-money was the infamous, sacrilegious chart that shows that the U.S. dollar has lost 99% of its value over time. Most Bitcoiners, including Michael Saylor and co., love to share this as the bedrock of the argument for bitcoin as money. Money supply goes up, value of the dollar comes down — currency debasement at the hands of the government, as the story goes.  Source: Visual Capitalist  I have already explained in Part 1 what I think about the relationship between money supply and prices, but here I’d like to go one level deeper.  Let’s start with what money is. It is a claim on real resources. Despite the intense, contested debates across historians, anthropologists, economists, ecologists, philosophers, etc., about what counts as money or its dynamics, I think it is reasonable to assume that the underlying claim across the board is that it is a thing that allows the holder to procure goods and services.  With this backdrop then, it doesn’t make sense to look at an isolated value of money. Really though, how can someone show the value of money in and of itself (e.g., the value of the dollar is down 99%)? Its value is only relative to something, either other currencies or the amount of goods and services that can be procured. Therefore, the fatalistic chart showing the debasement of fiat doesn’t say anything. What matters is the purchasing power of consumers using that fiat currency, as wages and other social relations denominated in fiat currency also move synchronously. Are U.S. consumers able to purchase 99% less with their wages? Of course not.  The counterarguments to this typically are that wages don’t keep up with inflation and that over the short-medium term, cash savings lose value which hurts the working class as it doesn’t have access to high yielding investments. Real wages in the U.S. have been constant since the early 1970s, which in and of itself is a major socioeconomic problem. But there is no direct causal link between the expansionary nature of fiat and this wage trend. In fact, the 1970s were the start of the neoliberal regime under which labor power was crushed, economies were deregulated in favor of capital and industrial jobs were outsourced to underpaid and exploited workers in the Global South. But I digress.  Let’s go back to the what is money question. Apart from a claim over resources, is money also a store of value over the medium term? Again, I want to be clear that I am talking only about developed nations thus far, where hyperinflation isn’t a real thing so purchasing power doesn’t erode overnight. I’d argue that it is not the role of money — cash and its equivalents like bank deposits — to serve as a store of value over the medium-long term. It is supposed to serve as a medium of exchange which requires price stability only in the short run, coupled with gradual and expected devaluation over time. Combining both features — a highly liquid, exchangeable asset and a long-term savings mechanism — into one thing makes money a complicated, and maybe even contradictory, concept.  To protect purchasing power, access to financial services needs to be expanded so that people have access to relatively safe assets that keep up with inflation. Concentration of the financial sector into a handful of large players driven by profit motive alone is a major impediment to this. There is no inherent reason that an inflationary fiat currency has to lead to a loss of purchasing power time, especially when, as argued in Part 1, price changes can happen because of multiple non-monetary reasons. Our socioeconomic setup, by which I mean the power of labor to negotiate wages, what happens to profit, etc., needs to enable purchasing power to rise. Let’s not forget that in the post-WWII era  even though money supply was not growing (officially the U.S. was under the gold standard but we know it was not being enforced, which led to Nixon moving away from the system in 1971).  Okay so where does money come from and were 40% of dollars printed during the 2020 government stimulus, as is commonly claimed?  Neoclassical economics, which the Bitcoin standard narrative employs at various levels, argues that the government either borrows money by selling debt, or that it prints money. Banks lend money based on deposits by their clients (savers), with fractional reserve banking allowing banks to lend multiples higher than what is deposited. It comes as no surprise to anyone who is still reading that I’d argue both these concepts are wrong.  Here’s the correct story which (trigger warning again) is MMT based — credit where it's due — but agreed to by bond investors and financial market experts, even if they disagree on the implications. The government has a monopoly on money creation through its position as the sovereign. It creates the national currency, imposes taxes and fines in it and uses its political authority to protect against counterfeit.  There are two distinct ways in which The State interacts with the monetary system: one, through the central bank, it provides liquidity to the banking system. The central bank does not “print money” as we colloquially understand it, rather it creates bank reserves, a special form of money that isn’t really money that is used to buy goods and services in the real economy. These are assets for commercial banks that are used for inter-bank operations.  Quantitative easing (those scary big numbers that the central bank announces it is injecting by buying bonds) is categorically not money printing, but simply central banks swapping interest bearing bonds with bank reserves, a net neutral transaction as far as the money supply is concerned even though the central bank balance sheet expands. It does have an impact on asset prices through various indirect mechanisms, but I won’t go into the details here and will let this great  by Alfonso Peccatiello (@MacroAlf on Twitter) explain.  So the next time you hear about the Fed “printing trillions” or expanding its balance sheet by X trillion, just think about whether you are actually talking about reserves, which again don’t enter the real economy so do not contribute to “more money chasing the same amount of goods” story, or actual money in circulation.  Two, the government can also, through the Treasury, or its equivalent, create money (normal people money) that is distributed through the government’s bank – the central bank. The modus operandi for this operation is typically as follows:  * Say the government decides to send a one-time cash transfer to all citizens.  * The Treasury authorizes that payment and tasks the central bank to execute it.  * The central bank marks up the account that each commercial bank has at the central bank (all digital, just numbers on a screen — these are reserves being created).  * the commercial banks correspondingly mark up the accounts of their customers (this is money being created).  * customers/citizens get more money to spend/save.  This type of government spending (fiscal policy) directly injects money into the economy and is thus distinct from monetary policy. Direct cash transfers, unemployment benefits, payments to vendors, etc., are examples of fiscal spending.  Most of what we call money, however, is created by commercial banks directly. Banks are licensed agents of The State, to which The State has extended its powers of money creation, and they create money out of thin air, unconstrained by reserves, every time a loan is made. Such is the magic of double-entry bookkeeping, a practice that has been in use for centuries, where money comes into being as a liability for the issuer and an asset for the receiver, netting out to zero. And to reiterate, banks don’t need a certain amount of deposits to make these loans. Loans are made subject to whether the bank thinks it makes economic sense to do so — if it needs reserves to meet regulations, it simply  them from the central bank. There are capital, not reserve, constraints on lending but those are beyond the scope of this piece. The primary consideration for banks in making loans/creating money is profit maximization, not whether it has enough deposits in its vault. In fact, banks are creating deposits by making loans.  This is a pivotal shift in the story. My analogy for this is parents (neoclassical economists) telling children a fake birds and bees story in response to the question of where babies come from. Instead, they never correct it leading to an adult citizenry running around without knowing about reproduction. This is why most people still talk about fractional reserve banking or there being some naturally fixed supply of money that the private and public sectors compete over, because that’s what econ 101 teaches us.  Let’s revisit the concept of money supply now. Given that most of the money in circulation comes from the banking sector, and that this money creation is not constrained by deposits, it is reasonable to claim that the stock of money in the economy is not just driven by supply, but by demand as well. If businesses and individuals are not demanding new loans, banks are unable to create new money. This has a symbiotic relationship with the business cycle, as money creation is driven by expectations and market outlook but also drives investment and expansion of output.  The chart below shows a measure of bank lending compared to M2. While the two have a positive correlation, it does not always hold, as is glaringly evident in 2020. So even though M2 was surging higher post-pandemic, banks were not lending due to uncertain economic conditions. As far as inflation is concerned, there is the added complexity of what banks are lending for, i.e., whether those loans are being used for productive ends, which would increase economic output or unproductive ends, which would end up leading to (asset) inflation. This decision is not driven by the government, but by the private sector.  The last complication to add here is that while the above metrics serve as useful measures for what happens within the US economy, they do not capture the money creation that happens in the  (eurodollars have nothing to do with the euro, they simply refer to the existence of USD outside the U.S. economy).  Jeff Snider gave an excellent run through of this during his appearance on the What Bitcoin Did  for anyone who wants a deep-dive, but essentially this is a network of financial institutions that operate outside the U.S., are not under the formal jurisdiction of any regulatory authority and have the license to create U.S. dollars in foreign markets.  This is because the USD is the reserve currency and required for international trade between two parties that may not have anything to do with the U.S. even. For example, a French bank may issue a loan denominated in U.S. dollars to a Korean company wanting to buy copper from a Chilean miner. The amount of money created in this market is anyone’s guess and hence, a true measure of the money supply is not even feasible.  This is what Alan Greenspan in a 2000 FOMC meeting:  “The problem is that we cannot extract from our statistical database what is true money conceptually, either in the transactions mode or the store-of-value mode.”  Here he refers not just to the Eurodollar system but also the proliferation of complex financial products that occupy the shadow banking system. It’s hard to talk about money supply when it's hard to even define money, given the prevalence of money-like substitutes.  Therefore, the argument that government intervention through fiscal and monetary expansion drives inflation is simply not true as most of the money in circulation is outside the direct control of the government. Could the government overheat the economy through overspending? Sure. But that is not some predefined relationship and is subject to the state of the economy, expectations, etc.  The notion that the government is printing trillions of dollars and debasing its currency is, to no one’s surprise at this point, just not true. Only looking at monetary intervention by the government presents an incomplete picture as that injection of liquidity could be, and in many cases is, making up for the loss of liquidity in the shadow banking sector. Inflation is a complex topic, driven by consumer expectations, corporate pricing power, money in circulation, supply chain disruptions, energy costs, etc. It cannot and should not be simply reduced to a monetary phenomenon, especially not by looking at something as one-dimensional as the M2 chart.  Lastly, the economy should be seen, as the post-Keynesians showed, as interlocking balance sheets. This is true simply through accounting identity — someone’s asset has to be someone else’s liability. Therefore, when we talk about paying back the debt or reducing government spending, the question should be what other balance sheets get affected and how. Let me give a simplified example: in the 1990s during the Clinton era, the U.S. government celebrated  and paying back its national debt. However, since by definition someone else had to be getting more indebted, the U.S. household sector . And since households couldn’t create money while the government could, that increased the overall risk in the financial sector.  Bitcoin As Money  I can imagine the people reading till now (if you made it this far) saying “Bitcoin fixes this!” because it's transparent, has a fixed issuance rate and a supply cap of 21 million. Here I have both economic and philosophic arguments as for why these features, regardless of the current state of fiat currency, are not the superior solution that they are described to be. The first thing to note here is that, as this piece has hopefully shown thus far, that since the rate of change of money supply is not equal to inflation, inflation under BTC is not transparent or programmatic and will still be subject to the forces of demand and supply, power of the price setters, exogenous shocks, etc.  Money is the grease that allows the cogs of the economy to churn without too much friction. It flows to sectors of the economy that require more of it, allows new avenues to develop and acts as a system that, ideally, irons out wrinkles. The Bitcoin standard argument rests on the neoclassical assumption that the government controls (or manipulates, as Bitcoiners call it) the money supply and that wrestling away this power would lead to some true form of a monetary system. However, our current financial system is largely run by a network of private actors that The State has little, arguably too little, control over, despite these actors benefitting from The State insuring deposits and acting as the lender of last resort. And yes, of course elite capture of The State makes the nexus between financial institutions and the government culpable for this mess.  But even if we take the Hayekian approach, which focuses on decentralizing control completely and harnessing the collective intelligence of society, countering the current system with these features of Bitcoin falls into the technocratic end of the spectrum because they are prescriptive and create rigidity. Should there be a cap on money supply? What is the appropriate issuance of new money? Should this hold in all situations agnostic of other socioeconomic conditions? Pretending that Satoshi somehow was able to answer all these questions across time and space, to the extent that no one should make any adjustments, seems remarkably technocratic for a community that is talking about the “people’s money” and freedom from the tyranny of experts.  Bitcoin is not democratic and not controlled by the people, despite it offering a low barrier to enter the financial system. Just because it is not centrally governed and the rules can’t be changed by a small minority does not, by definition, mean Bitcoin is some bottom-up form of money. It is not neutral money either because the choice to create a system that has a fixed supply is a subjective and political choice of what money should be, rather than some a priori superior quality. Some proponents might say that, if need be, Bitcoin can be changed through the action of the majority, but as soon as this door is opened, questions of politics, equality and justice flood back in, taking this conversation back to the start of history. This is not to say that these features are not valuable — indeed they are, as I argue later, but for other use-cases.  Therefore, my contentions thus far have been that:  * Understanding the money supply is complicated because of the financial complexity at play.  * The money supply does not necessarily lead to inflation.  * Governments do not control the money supply and that central bank money (reserves) are not the same thing as money.  * Inflationary currencies do not necessarily lead to a loss of purchasing power, and that that depends more on the socioeconomic setup.  * An endogenous, elastic money supply is necessary to adjust to economic changes.  * Bitcoin is not democratic money simply even though its governance is decentralized.  In Part 3, I discuss the history of money and its relationship with the state, analyze other conceptual arguments that underpin the Bitcoin Standard, provide a perspective on the Global South, and present alternative use-cases.

The miners will have the choice of becoming validators for the new chain or they could continue mining by switching over to the Ethereum Classic fork.  Ethereum fork viability  Another choice for the miners is to jump onto a new PoW chain should a hard fork be introduced. The chances of this happening are fairly likely, and some miners may choose to try their luck here.  The ETHPOW token would be the native token for the new PoW chain and is predicted to launch at a price of at least $18. Holders of ETH will receive the token for free. Those who hold ETH on an exchange will need to check that it will support the new token.  However, some experts are saying that the potential PoW chain fork will not gain much traction, given the lack of any Oracle support, the fact that most dApps support the merge, and also, the Ethereum Classic case shows that very few developers worked on it.  Not faster and cheaper yet  There has been some miscommunication about the merge, especially among retail investors, that it will bring a much cheaper and faster network for users.  The Ethereum Foundation has clarified that these particular benefits will not necessarily happen yet, but that energy efficiency will be much more enhanced. Meaning that all dApps that place a premium on energy efficiency are likely to remain on the Ethereum blockchain.  Iacov Levin, CEO and Founder of Midas Investments, a long-term wealth generation platform with $200 million under management, stated:  “Most likely, the transition to energy efficiency by Ethereum will be set as a standard or a yardstick upon which many other energy-consuming blockchain protocols will be gauged in the near future. The narrative amongst investors, asset managers, and regulators will be that if Ethereum can successfully transition, then other PoW protocols should also be able to transition for the greater good of all.”  After the Merge  If successful, the Merge will go a long way towards establishing the continuance of Ethereum as the primary smart contract blockchain for future development.  Levin had the following to say on how he thinks Ethereum will close the gap on Bitcoin:  “Ethereum is bound to become increasingly reckoned with as an energy-efficient blockchain, decoupling from the negative sentiment plaguing Bitcoin as a major factor fueling environmental climatic degradation. By virtue of this changed outlook, institutional investors may be more inclined to stack up on the asset, thus pushing it to close the pricing gap between it and Bitcoin.”  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

"106",327,2022-09-02,"Blockchain.News","Ethereum miner addresses have continued to grow and are now at a 4-year high according to on-chain data.  As pointed out by independent crypto reporter, Colin Wu citing data from OKLink, the balance of Ethereum miner addresses exceeded 260,000, with a total of 261,848, which has risen to the level of the same period in April 2018, a record high in four years, and is about 415 million US dollars at current prices.  Source: OKlink  According to the charts above, the number of addresses is moving upward, and in an opposite direction to the current price of Ethereum which is on the decline. The rising number of Ethereum addresses has showcased the last attempts on the parts of Proof-of-Work (PoW) miners to accrue as many Ether as they can before the forthcoming The Merge.  With  for September 15, a Difficulty Bomb' will be ushered in that will largely make mining more difficult and largely impractical.  With the difficulty bomb, mining will become largely unprofitable as miners will be expected to shift their roles in order to become validators in the newly ushered-in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  The miners have nothing to lose for getting involved with Ethereum mining at this time. In fact, some may consider the mining endeavours to be an avenue to accumulate Ethereum at a time when the odds are in the favour of the miners. As the date for the Merge draws nearer, there is a likelihood that we will see increased traction in the number of miner addresses that will be recorded on-chain as an attempt to put their mining resources to good use will be heightened.  The Ethereum network is setting very unique precedence for the PoW protocols at a time when the clamour for environmental sustainability is growing by the day."

In this episode, the hosts are joined by Margo Paez, a climate change physicist and fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute who advocates for Bitcoin from a progressive mindset.   or   Listen To The Episode Here:  Q: I just want to give you the opportunity to speak directly to Elizabeth Warren… Say exactly what you hope to say to her to… change her mind [on Bitcoin].  Margot Paez: Elizabeth Warren really doesn't understand Bitcoin, that's for sure. I find it really ironic that Elizabeth Warren used to be a champion of the people against the banking system, against Wells Fargo, against Chase, against HSBC, against all of these companies that took advantage of people during the financial crisis.  And she used to be an advocate. And in fact, I've heard her even over the pandemic, she was really critical of the amount of banking fees that were being put on people during the pandemic. And she was right...Why are you charging people all these fees just to hold their money in your bank account when they, again, have no choice but to put it in your bank account, right?  Again, it's another one of those oligopoly situations where you don't have the freedom of choice in terms of banking.  So, I would challenge her to think like, what really is the solution that you want? How do you really wanna solve this problem? Because there is an existing solution, it's called Bitcoin, and it's one where people can actually exit the existing banking system, take custody of their own money and not worry about fees, not worry about banks taking advantage of them because it’s their money and they’re managing it themselves or they’re managing it in their community…  You want community banks? You can have a community bank with Bitcoin… These are the solutions that I thought Elizabeth Warren wanted [but] it seems that she doesn’t really want to help people…  Ultimately … Bitcoin is a lifeboat. And what’s wrong with people having a lifeboat?"

Wiping out tens of billions of dollars in market capitalization and garnering unprecedented losses for investors, such a crisis is encouraging regulators to take speedier action in terms of oversight of the digital assets arena.  Globally, countries are taking a broad variety of approaches, with the UK currently playing catch up with some of the jurisdictions, which have been quicker to embrace a more regulated approach. Ultimately the balance that needs to be struck within any framework that is adopted, is between giving investors more protection but still allowing blockchain/crypto businesses to continue to innovate at the pace that has caused such excitement and promises so much.  Globally there is a diverse regulatory approach  The world is very much divided in its approach to the regulation of cryptocurrencies. Typically, it takes its direction in the regulation of financial services from the US, although it is yet to develop a clear regulatory framework for the asset class. However, in March, President Biden signed off a  on Ensuring Responsible Development of Digital Assets, in what was viewed as a concrete acknowledgment of the potential of the cryptocurrency industry.  The order lays out initiatives to study and engage in constructive problem solving around known risks that exist with the legacy financial system, and the new  world. This order will direct agencies to coordinate their regulatory efforts, focusing on privacy, security, financial inclusion, and global competitiveness for the USD. What’s more, very recently, the US introduced the , which is committed to ensuring that financial innovation does not come at the expense of the consumer. The bill will also review the environmental impact of crypto, which is an important factor in its long-term viability.  Meanwhile, neighboring Canada approved a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (  ), and proactively issued guidance requiring local crypto trading platforms and dealers to register with provincial . Just last year, Canada unleashed a clear registration regime for trading platforms that provide custodial services to local clients. This has seen several firms register under the new rules, with the sector experiencing healthy growth in the region.  In Asia and the Middle East, advances are being made too.  issued its first crypto law regulating virtual assets this year. Meanwhile,  has approached cryptocurrency with trepidation, with its Ministry of Finance equating cryptocurrencies to Ponzi schemes. Nonetheless, last year, India  second place out of 154 countries in the crypto adoption index – suggesting the government may have to rethink its attitude.  In Europe, Switzerland has arguably gone the furthest in passing blockchain laws, licensing two crypto banks as far back as 2019, the EU has proposed a wider framework to regulate issuers and service providers dealing with crypto assets in the EU. The European Parliament recently approved a draft of the , which will be consulted with the EU's executive branch and heads of member states. The new regulation will see the introduction of a European “passport,” enabling non-EU crypto platforms and service providers to apply for a license that will allow them to operate across all EU member countries.  UK finally catching up  After stalling for some time, the UK has finally signaled a move forward with plans to regulate payment stablecoins. An HM Treasury spokesperson commented that such regulation will “create the conditions for issuers and service providers to operate and grow in the UK, whilst ensuring financial stability and high regulatory standards.” The market instability of stablecoins will need to be recognized while the governments begin to develop and implement new rules on crypto assets.  The Treasury recently said that beyond stablecoins, it planned to consult on regulating a range of digital currencies – although the exact details were ambiguous. Then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak : ""We want to see the [cryptocurrency] businesses of tomorrow - and the jobs they create - here in the UK, and by regulating effectively, we can give them the confidence they need to think and invest long-term.""  Around blockchain technology, the government will look into the use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in financial markets, contemplate using DLT for sovereign debt instruments and create a financial markets infrastructure sandbox to allow companies to test DLT in the operation of markets.  Reducing financial risk  As more and more countries look to regulate crypto markets, there is a common thread in their approach – reducing financial risk.  Innovation can equate to exciting growth and prosperity when it runs smoothly, but there are inevitable consequences when issues arise, and the crypto market should be realistic about how much independence they can have in a growth environment.  In order for the new regulations being mooted to be effective, there need to be stringent measures in place – such as prior authorization for issuers to operate, capital and liquidity requirements, and accounting and auditing obligations. In turn, this will provide consumers with the confidence to move forwards and continue to adopt crypto as an alternative means to traditional finance options.  Fine balance needed to deliver growth with governance  Regulatory clarity and appropriate governance are essential if we want to see broad-based mainstream adoption of crypto infrastructure in commerce and in the financial markets. In addition, greater regulatory guidance, if well targeted, could help limit speculation on crypto assets.  Less speculation could lead to greater investor confidence, which could draw in more long-term investors who have so far not been attracted to a highly speculative, volatile crypto market.  Overall, it’s clear that globally, regulatory compliance is still a work in progress. Yet whatever further steps are taken, they should have at their heart a simple principle, probably best articulated by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yelland in a recent speech, where she said: “our regulatory frameworks should be designed to support responsible innovation while managing risks – especially those that could disrupt the financial system and economy.”  It's this balance, which regulators need to get right, that will have perhaps the strongest sway over the future prospects of a sector that has dazzled many but still disturbs others.  _____"

"110",647,2022-08-31,"Cryptonews.com","Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benítez has spectacularly scuppered a much-vaunted bill that would have legalized and regulated  and crypto mining in the Latin American country.  As , the ambitious draft law began as a private member’s bill in the lower house and was formulated in conjunction with domestic miners who want to use surplus electrical energy produced at hydroelectric plants. It was eventually taken up by the Senate, where it was championed by Senator Fernando Silva Facetti.  The Senate then approved the bill, as did the lower house. But it appears to have fallen at the very last hurdle, with Benítez unhappy about how crypto mining’s electricity consumption could impact sustainability in the long run.  Benítez,  Portalo de Bitcoin, decreed that crypto mining “requires a high level of electricity consumption that could compromise the development and expansion of an inclusive and sustainable national industry.” The decree, which the President remarked had been made after taking advice from the nation’s central bank, also made note of the fact that mining makes “intensive use of capital and low use of manpower,” and “as such, does not generate added value” for the economy.  Earlier this month, Cryptonews.com  that the bill had drawn criticism from many politicians, some of whom claimed that the draft law had been hurried.  Others still repeated all-too-familiar claims about mining’s alleged high carbon footprint. International miners have stated that they will agree to set up shop in Paraguay, providing they are offered special, low electricity rates.  The same critics also claimed that Paraguay has very little to gain by allowing international miners access to Paraguayan power – and that few domestic jobs would be created as a result.  This line of argument appears to have swayed Benítez.  But a furious Silva Facetti  to Twitter to criticize the President’s decision – which he labeled a “total veto.” The Senator claimed the veto made little sense considering the vast number of miners already operating in the country.  The Senator wrote that the Executive branch of the government was guilty of “ignoring the existence of” miners, who will now have to “work in the shadow of regulations.”  The Senator wrote that the President had “washed his hands of” mining, and forced it to “operate in a gray area, without being able to enjoy access to the financial system or build in investor protection guarantees.”  He added that Benítez had shown a “lack of vision” in his ruling opposes and had “destroyed the possibility of the arrival of new investors” – as well as crippling the hopes of “hundreds of small and medium-sized” domestic companies that “live and depend on this industry.”  Worse still, Silva Facetti warned, the move will mean that instead of using its surplus energy to fuel economic growth, Paraguay will have to hand over its excess power to its neighbors Argentina and Brazil.  Under bilateral agreements Paraguay has signed with both Argentina and Brazil, Paraguay must donate all the energy it generates at hydroelectric plants on rivers that border the nations if it is unable to either use or sell this electrical power.  Supporters of the bill have pointed out the fact that Paraguay’s infrastructure is set up to consume fossil fuels, rather than hydroelectric power – meaning that 10% of the country’s hydroelectric power is “unusable” in the nation. As such, failing to make use of the power – by allowing miners to buy it – will simply strengthen the economy of Argentina and Brazil at Paraguay’s expense.  Multiple Chinese and East Asian players were reportedly awaiting the confirmation of the bill before making final decisions on relocating to the country. Others, however, have already set up shop in the nation – and will likely now have to operate in a “gray,” unregulated area.  ___"

Checklist  Ethereum founder  alerted node operators to upgrade their clients in preparation for the 6 September upgrade on the Beacon chain before the Merge.  It would go live from 10-20 September. But before that, the beacon chain would go live on 6 Sep.  Buterin took to Twitter and   “Reminder: even though the merge is coming around Sep 10-20, the beacon chain hard fork is on Sep 6. Make sure to update your clients before then!”  The Merge represents the joining of the existing execution layer of Ethereum with its new proof-of-stake consensus layer, the Beacon Chain.  It would eliminate the need for energy-intensive mining. And, instead, secure the network using staked ETH.  A truly exciting step in realizing the Ethereum vision of more scalability, security, and sustainability.  With the Bellatrix upgrade, the Beacon chain upgrade already seems to be in the works.  What’s in it for me?  Investors within the Ethereum network have showcased their support before the upgrade. Especially, institutional investors.

"112",1570,2022-08-30,"CryptoDaily","As people continue to lead busier lives, with jobs to juggle, relationships to navigate, and friendships to sustain, people have less time in the day. With a restricted number of free hours each day, people across the world are prioritizing different elements in their free time. When it comes to keeping healthy, this is often one of the first things to go, with less than 5% of Americans participating in 30 minutes of physical activity each day.  With rates of exercise nearing an all-time low and bad eating habits taking over, it’s no surprise that it’s projected that half of all adults in the USA will be obese by 2030. A whole plethora of health conditions are associated with obesity, with high blood pressure at the least and diabetes, osteoporosis, and higher rates of anxiety and depression at the most.  The CDC recommends that the average adult should undertake at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and two days of muscle strengthening each week in order to keep in line with the best current practices for health. But, with the many other areas that people need to keep track of, it’s becoming harder and harder to find the motivation to prioritize keeping fit.  Although diet restrictions, exercise plans, and nationwide incentives have been suggested before, nothing has really stuck. That’s where Sweat Economy comes in, providing a financial incentive for users to get active, stay fit, and move their bodies.  Introducing Sweat Economy  Sweatcoin is a Web 2.0 downloadable application that has been going since 2016. Seeing the rising obesity levels around the world and the deprioritization of exercise, the team behind the app wanted to design something that helped people to make exercise a more active habit.  While people have tried workout apps before, Sweatcoin is completely distinct as it actively rewards people for exercising. Using instant gratification and giving users SWEAT coins to spend on brands, charity donations, or services, they include a financial reward to exercise. For those that don’t prioritize exercise, this financial motivation has been life-changing, giving people more of a reason to put their health first.  With an impressive user base and an array of awards, Sweatcoin has diverged in 2022 into a new Web 3.0 system - Sweat Economy. Sweat Economy takes the principles of financial incentives to exercise and pushes them one step further, incorporating cryptocurrency into the mix.  Instead of only being able to use Web 2.0 Sweatcoins for pre-created deals that Sweat Economy has with other brands, the generation of SWEAT cryptocurrency opens up the possibilities of the coin. By walking, users can collect SWEAT tokens, which can then be used for a variety of different actions within the world of blockchain.  For those not interested in cryptocurrency, users can cash out their SWEAT tokens into a stablecoin and then into USD. Equally, users could add their coins to liquidity pools and stake them, turning them into a form of passive income. As Sweat Economy pushes into the world of blockchain, the extent of financial choice that comes with earning from walking is extended, making this into an even more comprehensive system.  The History Behind SweatCoin  SweatCoin started back in 2015 and hit the ground running. Aiming to combat the rising tide of global obesity, they set out with a goal of actively changing the world. From awarding individuals that go for daily walks to attempting to shift away from our sedentary lifestyle, SweatCoin attempts to get people up and moving.  They’ve gained a huge deal of traction since its beginning, currently sitting at the most downloaded health and fitness app in 2022. But, even before the success of this year, SweatCoin has been the number one app in over 60 different countries, pulling in over 100,000,000 registered users to the platform. Even within investing circles, Sweatcoin has turned a lot of heads, raising over $13 million in a private token sale.  While the central idea of the application is largely responsible for its success, the team behind it and the vision they have held since the beginning is arguably equally important. In an interview with Anton Derlyatka, the CEO and Co-Founder of Sweat Economy, showed his passion for the project:  “I think what’s important is to have an idea that you really, really believe in that can touch a billion people.”  The principles behind Sweat Economy all come back to this, with the application and its extension into the world of crypto finance allowing people from all over the world to get support with their fitness journey. Quite simply, this app was designed to be a global success, touching the lives of billions.  How Does Sweat Economy Work?  Sweat Economy is a direct extension of the features that have made Web 2.0 Sweatcoin a hit. The main premise of this application is incredibly simple - you walk, and those steps are converted into cryptocurrency at certain distances. The application works in the background, taking data from the Health app in order to collect an accurate step count.  The UX of the application is very straightforward, displaying an active step counter at the top and the current ratio between steps and Sweatcoins. This ratio will continuously change over the years, combating inflation to ensure the supply of SWEAT remains stable.  For example, after the token generation event in September, 1k of steps will convert into 1 SWEAT. By 2023, 1k of steps will be 0.33 SWEAT. A little under a decade later, in 2032, 1k steps would only convert into 0.02 SWEAT, helping to ensure the economy isn’t flooded with coin minting.  This sustainable tokenomics model is designed for longevity, with this scaling structure and periodic token burning creating a stable token development model.  Another major part of the Sweat Economy is focusing on social sharing. A leading mechanism that they use to increase user consumption and sign-ups is a referral scheme. Any user that currently has a Sweat account can refer a friend to the application, getting 5 SWEAT as a reward. By incorporating this system into the fundamental features of the application, they incentivize community sharing, helping push further toward their goal of uniting a billion users that are actively working for better health.  What Can I Do With My SWEAT Tokens?  Currently, with the Web 2.0 Sweatcoin, the SWEAT that people generate is not a cryptocurrency, but simply a digital token that the application itself deems valuable. With the current system, users are able to use the SWEAT that they’ve earned in a range of ways, each providing users with a distinct way to spend the tokens they’ve accumulated through moving.  Currently, there are a few main methods of spending SWEAT:  * Spend - Since its founding back in 2015, Sweatcoin has built up a network of partnerships with 1000s of brands around the globe. With Sweatcoins, you can unlock discounts in stores, pay for certain goods, and pay for subscriptions to your favorite services in SWEAT.  * Donate - Sweatcoin frequently runs donation events for a variety of environmental, animal preservation, and humanitarian causes. By selecting one of the over 100 charities that they work with, you’ll be able to donate to their fundraisers, giving back to a cause that moves you.  * Exchange - Finally, with the TGE on the horizon, you’ll be able to match your current base of Sweatcoins with an equal amount of SWEAT cryptocurrency, then using this as an active digital asset.  As the Token Generator Event goes live in mid-September, SWEAT will be imbued with another range of different functions. As a cryptocurrency, SWEAT gives users the ability to get involved in a range of different blockchain systems.  For example, with the cryptocurrency SWEAT, users can:  * Exchange - They can exchange their SWEAT tokens for USD or stablecoins.  * NFTs - They can buy NFTs within the SWEAT network, investing in other digital assets.  * Stake - Users of SWEAT could stake their coins, locking them away in liquidity pools and earning a consistent yield return on their coins.  As SWEAT launches as a cryptocurrency, those in the community that have already accumulated SWEAT will be able to turn all of their current coin base into crypto and start to get involved with all the new functions that Sweat Economy is proposing.  Final Thoughts  Sweatcoin, and its soon-to-launch web3 Sweat Wallet, allows users to take fitness into their own hands. By incentivizing walking and active movement, Sweat Economy helps users to work towards a healthier tomorrow, rewarding them for walking with cryptocurrency. From staking to earn a passive yield to exchanging their coins for goods and services, this financial incentive might be just the thing people need to inspire themselves to get moving.  With a devoted team, a clear roadmap for long-term growth, and impressive fundamentals and tokenomics, Sweat Economy has all the markings of a fantastic product. At its core, Sweat Economy pushes people to put fitness first, helping to combat the rising levels of global obesity and make exercise a daily habit.  Quite simply, with Sweat Economy, it pays to keep fit.  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

"113",2640,2022-08-29,"Bitcoin Magazine","Surfin’ Bitcoin Conference, Casino Barrière Biarritz, France.  Josselin Tonnellier   organized the first  to educate people about Bitcoin and his French startup , through which Europeans can accumulate Bitcoin via dollar cost averaging.  “Bitcoin is quite niche in France. We have a lot of blockchain and shitcoining,” Tonnellier remarked.  There aren’t many Bitcoin-only businesses in France. It’s remarkable that a team of about five people was able to coordinate and fund a conference of Surfin’ Bitcoin’s size, with just ten sponsors, notably among them Bpifrance, an investment bank for entrepreneurs.  According to Tonnellier, more than half of this year’s conference attendees were professional Bitcoiners. Nearly 25% were Bitcoin enthusiasts and OGs, and about 25% of them were general crypto enthusiasts.  Tonnellier originally brought Surfin’ Bitcoin to the South of France to decentralize the event away from Paris. Over the past few years, Surfin’ Bitcoin has grown from a few hundred attendees to about 2,000.  There were just over one hundred speakers at the conference. About 35% of them came from abroad, mostly European countries. For the first time the event included English content, with around 45 scheduled English speakers, and around 50 who spoke in French.  The first day of the conference was free, drawing in early conference attendees and tourists from the beach, some of whom experienced their first touch-point with Bitcoin, together viewing the French documentary , by Remi Forte.  The conference hosted several debates—for example, Austrian economics vs Keynesian economics and crypto venture capitalists vs Bitcoin venture capitalists—in an attempt to stir up controversy, but also to win over crypto curious attendees with the Bitcoin maximalist point of view.  The main stage French presentations were packed throughout the conference, and what many of the English panels and workshops lacked in attendance they gained in interactivity between the audience and the speakers.  One Norwegian speaker even opted to come into the audience to do impromptu small group discussion of how best to defend Bitcoin mining from the often disingenuous environmental, social and governance (ESG) arguments against it.  The strength of Bitcoiners is that they are motivated whatever the situation, and that’s a strength altcoiners don’t have, Tonnellier noted.  “If the price is going up, I’m happy. If the price is going down, I’m happy because I accumulate more Bitcoin on the cheap. My clients understand that at StackingSat,” he said.  Tonnellier mentioned the , commenting that “we’re very sad by all the people that were wrecked by it, but it’s a way to clean the ecosystem of the actors who are not doing business in a proper way.”  He continued, “All the lending and defi stuff is quite dangerous, and can collapse very easily.”  Meanwhile, Bitcoin is thriving. “Bitcoin has faced many adversities throughout its life, and each time it comes out stronger,” he said.  The media in France hasn’t been too positive about Bitcoin, and Tonnellier noted the regulatory hurdles of launching both StackingSat and the conference. He hoped the conference itself will provide a positive Bitcoin touchpoint for the local Basque community.  The main downside to the Surfin’ Bitcoin conference was also its greatest virtue, the location.  The casino is beautiful. Light floods in from the two-story windows overlooking an expansive, sunny promenade, La Grande Plage. The busy beach is buffered by cliffs, swarms of swimmers in the rolling Atlantic and pods of surfers in the morning and late afternoon.  The allure of Basque country is so strong that many foreign attendees remarked on how hard it was to sit through full days worth of Bitcoin programming.  To the Southwest, attendees could see the mountains and lights of Spain. To the Northeast, the lighthouse on the cliffs and the luxurious Hôtel du Palais, a former imperial vacation villa built for Napoleon III.  Up and down the coast as far as one can see, an eclectic mix of architecture winds through the 12th century whaling port, with its endless roughcast villas, the gray stone of Bidache, the red stone of the Rhune, lining Biarritz’s alleys, bridges and staircases climbing the hills.  When walking between stages, down the exhibition hall, or taking lunch on the expansive casino roof, dotted with French conference attendees smoking cigarettes and chatting, you could see hundreds of people lying in the sun, up and down the coast, dozens tumbling in the waves.  Tonnellier’s goal was to educate people on Bitcoin in a relaxed environment by the beach, rather than host a “bowtie conference in Paris.”  Indeed, on the rooftop of Casino Barrière Biarritz, just a stone’s throw from the beach, over 1,000 Bitcoiners gathered at sunset, casually eating, drinking and networking.  Some danced as the DJ played on the closing night of the conference, most clustered in groups, chattering about Bitcoin and legacy finance until 4:00 a.m., when many then returned to their beachside hotels, or then parted to go clubbing together.  There seemed to be little small talk among enthusiastic Bitcoiners in Biarritz, many of whom have aligned philosophies, principles and lucid hyperbitcoinized visions for the world’s financial future.  Pierre Rochard  , VP of research at Riot Blockchain, moved away from France at a young age. He opted to speak in English at this year’s Surfing’ Bitcoin Conference.  Pierre attended his first Bitcoin conference in New York in 2013, where he met Suhas Daftuar. The connection later led to a Bitcoin job at Chaincode Labs.  At the time, during the 2012–2013 Cypriot financial crisis, Pierre recalls the sentiment among Bitcoiners on Reddit was that the bank run in Cyprus would trigger mass Bitcoin adoption.  The belief among Bitcoiners draws parallels to this day, where the network’s adoption is often assumed to be inversely proportional to the unethical behavior of central banks, and global state theft via inflation and taxes.  “You can’t really just foist Bitcoin onto the general public, and expect them to be interested,” Pierre remarked.  He went on to explain that the general public views Bitcoin as just a brand among crypto brands, in part due to the misleading advertising of the large crypto exchanges.  “Bitcoin’s node software is strictly superior to Dogecoin’s node software, for example, and the brand is just very far downstream from that fact,” he added.  Pierre recalls losing interest in Bitcoin during the 2014-2015 bear market. “I certainly didn’t rage quit or lose confidence in Bitcoin. I started focusing on building my own quadcopter drone instead.”  In 2015, when the price of Bitcoin was around $300 dollars, Pierre recalled a tongue-in-cheek conversation with Michael Goldstein. “We should just keep the Nakamoto Institute website up, even if Bitcoin doesn’t become a thing, as a historical artifact.”  Today, Pierre’s wife Morgen Rochard runs a financial planning practice, where she has succeeded in helping 90% of her clients get exposure to Bitcoin. “Most of them also hold their own private keys,” she said.  Pierre sees the perfect audience for Bitcoin conferences as the curious-to-casual Bitcoiners who are looking to further educate themselves.  In 2018 Pierre attended Consensus, where, at a satellite event put on by The Block, he was invited to speak on Bitcoin maximalism. At that event he met the team of his current employer, Riot Blockchain.  Pierre considers the challenge of conferences to be striking a content balance between pop-culture Bitcoin and open-source Bitcoin audiences.  An engaging balance was struck in Biarritz, with entire stages dedicated to expert-level Bitcoin content and technical workshops, and several controversial debates between professional Bitcoiners and altcoiners.  Prince Philip Karageorgevitch of Serbia  Prince Philip Karageorgevitch first encountered Bitcoin in the run up to $100 dollars in 2013. He first bought bitcoin in 2017 and held it through the bear market, buying regularly.  The prince began to learn more about Bitcoin in response to global government overreach during the covid pandemic. “That’s when I realized there’s something not right with this world.”  “I’m a Bitcoin maxi,” he stated. “Eventually I will probably be working in Bitcoin.”  At the conference Prince Philip delivered a keynote on why he is bullish on Bitcoin and also moderated a panel on the future perspective of Bitcoin and crypto markets.  He believes the benefit of Bitcoin conferences is that the crypto curious might educate themselves and become maximalists.  “Altcoiners also know there’s something wrong with the world, but they don’t know what it is really. They understand that money corrupts, but they don’t understand their money is corrupt,” he said.  Prince Philip explained how Bitcoin is the only ethical alternative to the fiat system, a maximalist position with which many crypto enthusiasts don’t agree.  “People aren’t taught about what money is really. They don’t understand how the wars of history are funded,” he said.  Indeed, many of those who neglect Bitcoin as a form of self-sovereign savings have left the market, and it remains to be seen how far below $20,000 bitcoin speculators, whales and noobs will send the price.  The common strategy among the French conference goers was to just buy and hodl Bitcoin, though many also spoke of small allocation, speculative derivative plays. Despite the bear market, there is no shortage of Bitcoin conferences in the coming months.  “This bear market is great because it sorts out those who really care about Bitcoin from those who are just here for fiat gains.”  Prince Philip commented that the crypto sponsorships and speaker slots that often accompany Bitcoin conferences are a good opportunity to educate people on Bitcoin maximalism.  “Right now nation states are considering Bitcoin,” he argued. “They have to because it’s a threat. If it’s a threat they have to have an insurance hedge against Bitcoin. The only insurance hedge against Bitcoin is to buy Bitcoin.”  The IMF and World Bank won’t admit it, but tourism increases in countries and cities that are friendly to Bitcoin. The greatest example of this is El Salvador,  in the first half of 2022, in part due to the influx of thousands of visiting Bitcoiners.  This is evident at Biarritz as well, where over the course of three days, thousands of Bitcoiners descended on the sunny Basque city, packing its hotels, beaches, clubs, tapas bars and restaurants.  Prince Philip remarked that in Serbia, however, the populace mistrusts governments, and is skeptical of outside powers, viewing Bitcoin as too good to be true. The country has gone through multiple wars in the past 90 years, experiencing the third highest hyperinflation in the world during the 1990’s.  Prince Philip concluded that with education, Serbians will understand how Bitcoin adoption empowers them to take control of their own money.  Charles Guillemet  , CTO at French cryptocurrency hardware wallet company Ledger, has a background in cryptography and security. He joined the firm in 2017.  According to Guillemet, Ledger currently has over 800 employees and is the largest crypto hardware wallet provider on the planet.  When I asked Guillemet whether he was a Bitcoiner, he hesitated. “Definitely I think Bitcoin is king. It has a unique value proposition in the ecosystem.”  Guillemet believes Ethereum also has a unique value proposition, “which can be respected as well.”  “With Ethereum there are plenty of technical challenges, and maybe a more efficient blockchain could take its place,” he conceded.  We agreed that Guillemet is a Bitcoiner, but not a Bitcoin maximalist.  I asked Guillemet whether he preferred Bitcoin or crypto conferences. He replied, “At Ledger we don’t have a religion. We are providing security tools for users to get onboarded. We have different trends.”  “What’s important for us is the seriousness of the project,” Guillemet said. I asked him how he qualified that. “It’s difficult. Does the project pass the test of time? Scammy projects don’t pass the test of time often. An ecosystem of developers is a good sign.”  Minutes later, Guillemet said that Ledger is looking to further platformize their product, so that “every single chain can be implemented within the device.”  In terms of Bitcoin developments at Ledger, Guillemet said that they will soon release the ability to run your own full node. Ledger is also working to integrate Tor to protect users’ privacy and release a Bitcoin credit card, to which users will be able to send Bitcoin as collateral for fiat credit.  Guillemet commented that conferences are good for exchanging ideas. “Bitcoin is a crossing point for technology, economics, and geopolitics. If you don’t get that, you don’t understand Bitcoin.  “It’s a paradigm shift. It’s not easy to understand Bitcoin when you come from the fiat monetary system,” he added.  In the event of a hardware wallet know-your-customer (KYC) regulatory crackdown in Europe, Guillemet commented that Ledger would have no choice but to comply. Nonetheless, he wants to ensure the current Ledger users are self sovereign.  He concluded, “For me what is apparent in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that if you don’t self custody, there’s no point.”  John Carvalho   is the founder and CEO of , which develops an ecosystem of applications and protocols for a future hyperbitcoinized world.  Carvalho is a self proclaimed toxic Bitcoin maximalist, meaning he doesn’t believe blockchains outside of Bitcoin are necessary or ethical forms of money. He is also skeptical of attempts to expand the idea of the Lightning Network outside of any non-payment use cases.  When I asked Carvalho how his business accounted for a multichain future, his response was, “By ignoring it.”  “The only people who care about a multichain world are people who are trying to sell you their chain,” he said.  Carvalho first bought Bitcoin in 2012 and attended his first conference in early 2013. “I was basically a full time Bitcoiner two months after getting some.” Over the next few months he plans to attend four Bitcoin conferences.  To be sure, Carvalho is an opinionated, but rational Bitcoiner. In reference to the  ’s invitation to have him debate  in Amsterdam, he commented, “Bitcoin debates should seek truth, not drama.”  “You can’t refute FUD [fear, uncertainty, and doubt]. You can try to rationalize with it, but they will keep changing the angle.”  Imagining his debate with Wall, Carvalho riffed, “You cannot innovate on Bitcoin in a way that compromises censorship resistance. Every shitcoin does that.”  “If the prerequisite for me taking you seriously is I have to accept a censorable blockchain, then the argument is over for me,” he added.  Carvalho opined that Wall, who is not a Bitcoin Maximalist, is coming to  to sow seeds of dissent. “I would like to see Bitcoin Magazine not focus on clicks and drama, like every other media outlet.”  Carvalho’s opinion, shared by many maximalists, is that if a business or individual offers their own product on a blockchain that is not Bitcoin, they should not be able to sponsor or get on stage at a Bitcoin conference. “These are business decisions, not Bitcoin decisions.”  The role of Bitcoin conferences, he said, is education and news.  In terms of the near-future outlook for Bitcoin, Carvalho would like “to see something cause Bitcoin to stop correlating with the U.S. stock market.""  ""It’s really frustrating me,"" he said. ""A lot of the ownership of Bitcoin is still speculators and traders.”  Carvalho concluded, “As a community and as a movement, we need to be promoting the idea of using Bitcoin as long-term savings, while also spending and accepting Bitcoin as a payment method.”"
"114",1434,2022-08-27,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Interstellar Bitcoin, a bitcoin pleb.  In a hypothetical world, imagine we are trying to stop Bitcoin. Why might we do it? How would we do it? What actions would we need to take? Where would this get us? To answer these questions, we first must talk about Bitcoin in a little more depth.  “If you know both yourself and your enemy, you can win a hundred battles without a single loss.” — Sun Tzu  Bitcoin is . It is technology that provides property rights, rule of law, economic freedom, free markets and, ultimately, sound money to the individual.  Bitcoin is a fixed supply ledger, defining who owns what and enabling people to transact peer-to-peer. Its ledger is enforced by proof-of-work, a consensus mechanism that utilizes energy in a way that   Fundamentally, Bitcoin is information and math, thus .  We’ve outlined what Bitcoin is. So why ban it?  Control.  Control over the ability to print money and the resulting . Control over what energy usage is “morally acceptable” and what is not, such as via “ESG” (environmental, social and governance) mandates. Control over a populace. Total authoritarianism.  [embed   We’ve got some reasons why someone might ban Bitcoin, but how would they do it?  Stage One  Unfavorable tax status for bitcoin.  Stage Two  Unfavorable regulation, ban the use of Bitcoin technology (aka make  ), internet censorship.  Or: Promote centrally controlled shitcoins that use proof-of-stake and banning proof-of-work. This is an alternative to try to subvert Bitcoin by promoting software that can be controlled by insiders.  Another alternative: censoring Bitcoin blocks and network spamming. This is a direct attack on the Bitcoin network that harms usability.  Stage Three  Energy shortages, internet outages, food shortages.  Stage Four  Mass genocide of Bitcoiners.  Think It Can’t Happen?  Read more  and history. Leaders do whatever they need to do to stay in power. Do not rule out energy and food shortages, either intentionally or caused by fiat policy mismanagement. Do not rule out intentional targeting of Bitcoiners.  It is important to remember that Bitcoiners have deeply held beliefs, generally summarized as: Bitcoin is good for humanity and money should be outside the control of the state. Bitcoin’s idea of a fixed-cap supply goes against orthodox economics, political structures and the status quo.  Bitcoiners are .  Bitcoiners are unwavering in their conviction for bitcoin  Only El Salvador and the Central African Republic have made Bitcoin legal tender. Most countries are already at Stage One: unfavorable tax laws.  Countries with favorable policy toward bitcoin  Nine countries, mostly those that are most authoritarian, have advanced to Stage Two with a partial or complete bitcoin ban : Algeria, Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar and Tunisia.  Imagine a world where global G20 coordination completely banned bitcoin using mass media to promote propaganda against it. Adoption would slow overnight. Countries would promise “stability” and “security” if only we’d implement another measure or use their central bank digital currency (CBDC).  At the same time, authorities could promote centrally controlled proof-of-stake shitcoins to divide and conquer people in “crypto” who also hold bitcoin. This is why it’s important to be bitcoin-only.  This could be paired with a direct attack on the Bitcoin network through block censorship and network spamming.  An example of block censorship was when  in 2021. Marathon only included transactions they deemed “clean” or “compliant,” ignoring other transactions at their own economic expense (  to censor transactions only a few months later).  Similarly, in 2017, the network withstood ongoing spam attacks by mining pools to flood the network with , driving up network fees to push their larger block agenda.  Now imagine a state actor — with effectively unlimited money — heavily subsidizing bitcoin miners who are compliant and spamming the network. This would harm bitcoin’s fungibility and usability as money.  Bitcoin’s 2017 high fee market was mainly driven by mining pools with an agenda of larger blocks.  However, game theory is on Bitcoin’s side. Eventually, state actors will face increasing problems to subsidize censorship and spam the network. Assuming attackers must print money to fund the attack, this devalues their currency against bitcoin. It’s a short-term attack that could only be effective if paired with a ban, propaganda and other measures.  The network will remain usable. People are willing to pay higher fees. There will always be miners who are economically incentivized to include any transaction.  If this didn’t attack didn’t work, countries could then try creating further uncertainty with power shortages, internet outages and food shortages — Stage Three.  This is already happening in the fiat world due to horrible fiat policies.  Taken to the extreme, some countries with the most effective propaganda could even start rounding up Bitcoiners — Stage Four. The government wouldn’t even need to do anything; citizens would do it for them out of fear.  To some extent, the labeling of Bitcoiners is happening already with overly burdensome know-your-customer (KYC) policies. Regulated financial institutions are required by law to keep a detailed list of personal and financial information (name, address, age, transaction volume, bitcoin addresses, etc.). This list would make it trivial for the state to find everyone who has ever traded, owned or used bitcoin via a centralized exchange.  Finally, the absolute worst option: government-sanctioned killing (aka democide). This, and the lesser extreme of forced imprisonment, can and does happen in . A hypothetical democide of Bitcoiners would cause irrevocable damage to humanity and ultimately bitcoin adoption.  Luckily, bitcoin is information, with no physical location. Everywhere and nowhere.  This poses a unique challenge for banning bitcoin: geographic arbitrage.  As countries crack down on bitcoin, the incentive for other countries to adopt bitcoin as legal tender grows.  El Salvador National Newspaper Announcing Bitcoin as Legal Tender. The headline is embedded in  for eternity.  “The plan is simple: as the world falls into tyranny, we’ll create a haven for freedom.” — Nayib Bukele, President of El Salvador  This is a perfect example of game theory.  Two countries banning bitcoin causes significant harm to both.  Two countries letting bitcoin exist causes both economies to thrive.  One country defecting and banning bitcoin while the other does nothing, harms only one country.  The unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies is down, right (No ban, No ban).  (Image/Interstellar Bitcoin)  What does this mean? Bitcoiners have an obligation to resist immoral and unjust laws. This will require civil disobedience and/or entering into politics to ensure we win. The next best alternative is retreating to bitcoin-friendly geographies like El Salvador.  Bitcoiners — and all people — have an obligation to resist immoral and unjust laws.  The question people thinking about banning bitcoin need to ask themselves is: are they willing to permanently imprison and kill to do it? The only way to stop an idea is to physically stop the people who hold an idea. Imagine George Orwell’s 1984 concept of .  It is up to the people to decide which path they will choose: freedom or tyranny.  All it takes is a few people to opt out with bitcoin.  So, how do we defend against these attacks?  * Shill to as many people as possible; the more people that hold bitcoin, the better.  * Teach the importance of self-custody and running your own full node. There are great resources by  and many others.  * Support bitcoin-only individuals, businesses and countries.  * Improve the underlying network and scaling technologies. For example,  and Layer 2s such as the Lightning Network.  * Build resilient communities and circular bitcoin economies.  * Become a Bitcoiner who is a beacon of hope in an abyss of darkness.  (  )  In conclusion, it is possible to maim bitcoin adoption temporarily, but at a punishing cost: fascism on a massive scale, not seen since WW2.  The key word here is “adoption.” It is impossible to kill the Bitcoin network, an idea of unstoppable sound money.  (  )  This article was based on a .  This is a guest post by Interstellar Bitcoin.

"115",877,2022-08-26,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Koji Higashi, a host of the Diamond Hands community.  This is the second article based on the content of the “  ” report produced by the , the largest Lightning Network community in Japan. The report aims to provide an overview of Lightning’s technology and ecosystem for a nontechnical audience. The first article can be found .  Micropayments With Lightning Applications  Applications that integrate Lightning payments can immediately reap the benefits of micropayment capacity, low fees and instant settlement. Since Lightning takes the majority of payments off the main Bitcoin blockchain, it can theoretically process millions of transactions per second while maintaining Bitcoin’s decentralized and permissionless nature — both essential to serve as the underlying technology for real-world practical applications.  Significant reduction in transaction costs and an increase in speed at a global scale with Lightning is no small feat. It can potentially serve billions of unbanked and/or underbanked people as well as cutting billions of dollars worth of costs in credit card fees alone.  The Lightning Network can potentially serve billions of unbanked and/or underbanked people  With all this said, the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, or now popularly referred to as “Web3,” seems to focus more on different types of applications with proprietary tokens closely integrated into the core of the service.  Indeed, Web3 projects with built-in tokens tend to have an easier time raising funds from venture capitalists and achieving ultra fast growth, thanks to the speculative nature of tokens and expectation of big gains for early investors and users. In that aspect, Lightning applications certainly underdeliver.  Although many Lightning applications utilize the Lightning Network to distribute small amounts of bitcoin (sats) to users, they won’t make you rich quickly — unlike some Web3 projects with tokens occasionally do if you’re lucky (or if you are an insider, to be more specific).  Issues With Web3 Applications  Of course, not everything is perfect with Web3.  Tokens are often too strong an incentive and can easily alter the purpose of using the service itself, damaging the overall product as a result. It blurs the line between the app’s actual utility and short-term speculative demand, often attracting the wrong type of users who don’t care about the service.  In other words, applications with an existent user base may risk hurting actual loyal users by integrating tokens into the core of their service. Understanding this, it’s not surprising that established game studios like Blizzard  into their platform.  Furthermore, use of cryptocurrency tokens often increases legal risks and compliance cost, making the token approach impractical for many established companies. It’s also undeniable that information asymmetry and lack of regulation around tokens often leads to fraud, with projects and early investors frequently dumping risk onto retail investors.  What Lightning Apps Bring To The Table  On the other hand, integrating Lightning payments in existing services are less likely to conflict with the existing product design, rather enhancing user experience and satisfaction.  Businesses are experimenting with new ways to utilize Lightning  For example, Zebedee, one of the leading Lightning companies for gaming, is working to integrate microbitcoin rewards in existing game titles, easily turning them into “play-to-earn games” with real bitcoin.  These rewards are relatively small and you won’t be able to make a living off of them. Instead, plugging in microbitcoin rewards can improve user retention and lower user acquisition cost, making distribution of microrewards economically feasible and sustainable for game developers.  The logic here is pretty simple, in my opinion. You are not really playing purely for money, but if you play some games for fun anyway, you’d rather earn some sats while doing so.  Similarly, Fountain applies Lightning in podcasting, rewarding users by listening to their favorite podcasts.  Both of these use cases don’t disrupt the original purpose of using the service itself. Lightning’s microrewards work as a gentle nudge to continue to do what they enjoy doing anyways, as opposed to trying to make people play boring games or listen to distasteful podcasts purely for the sake of receiving tokens and making quick money.  Conclusion  While we expect even more novel use cases to be discovered in the future, there are already a number of concrete use cases that leverage Lightning in remittances, inter-exchange transfers, microrewards, gaming and more, reducing transaction cost and improving user experience.  Lightning can be an effective tool to elevate products with real utility and existing user bases although it may not be powerful enough to achieve rapid monetary growth from zero, like some Web3 projects are designed to achieve through pump-and-dump schemes.  The jury is still out whether those Web3 apps can achieve both initial hypergrowth and long-term sustainability, but, to me, Lightning apps and Web3 serve different purposes and fulfill different needs, with different technical architecture and tradeoffs anyway.  We should accept these differences and build even more interesting and cool use cases with Lightning in the future.  This is a guest post by Koji Higashi.

"116",588,2022-08-25,"Cryptonews.com","Blockchain company Alóki has bought 750 acres of land in Costa Rica and is building a new play-to-own metaverse which is nearing its launch.  As awareness of the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions is rising across the world, Alóki is developing a project to allow users to contribute to sustainable development via a blockchain-based game in which real-world actions mirror those digital ones via non-fungible token (  ) ownership.  The 750-acre plot lies in a jungle located in the heart of Costa Rica, which is one of the leading countries in terms of sustainability and derives 98% of its energy from renewable sources, according to data obtained by Alóki.  Planting a tree in the Alóki metaverse will result in a real tree being planted in the Alóki Sanctuary of Costa Rica, the company claims.  Bartek Lechowski, CEO, Co-Founder, and Marketing and Experience Design Executive at Alóki, told Cryptonews.com that 27% of Costa Rica’s landscape is protected in reserves and national parks, and the nation is on the way to becoming fully carbon-neutral. This makes Costa Rica the ideal environment for the deployment of the project, he said.  Maurycy Krzastek, Founder, Creative Officer, and Financial Systems Developer at Alóki, told Cryptonews.com that they “aim to offer users from all audiences the chance of sharing such beliefs and joining our efforts at maintaining biodiversity and preserving natural habitats,” adding:  “We see this project as a way to attract new people with sustainable focus into the crypto space. Our intention is for this to be their first crypto project as we believe it's important for crypto and sustainability to work together.”  Krzastek further stated that “we believe there is not a single company nowadays that does not practice some form of corporate social responsibility and does not strive towards sustainability and green initiatives,” adding that Alóki welcomes all businesses and companies from any industry to join them.  Preliminary activities of the new metaverse are to be launched throughout the third quarter of 2022, ensuring a smooth transition toward the metaverse’s full launch, which is to take place around the second and third quarters of 2023, when Alóki will be introducing a land-based gameplay, according to the company’s CO.  According to Krzastek,  “The game itself will be launched in the fourth quarter of 2023. Prior to that, the project will be building up its community, conducting token sales, and offering users a host of NFTs for sale and activities, such as Spirit Quests to provide a gradual introduction to the essence of the game. We will also be launching the marketplace and other modules, such as NFT avatars, user interfaces and the website prior to the metaverse release.”  Asked about the project’s financing, Lechowski said that it will be financed through a number of key channels that rely on the use of its native Prana token. “The primary sale of NFTs and in-game items, as well as fees on transactions on the secondary market will provide steady streams of revenue,” he said.  Aloki will also be offering staking opportunities, NFT sales, and rewards that Lechowski said will ""ensure continued liquidity flows within the project and from external sources,"" adding:  ""The project is self-funded at this moment, and we are bringing in USD 30 million worth of land as an important asset.""  ____"

The community demonstrated overwhelming support for the foundation, with over 86 million  in favor of the proposal.    Source: Uniswap  Devin Walsh, Executive Director of the Uniswap Foundation, announced in a  late on Wednesday that the proposal to establish the foundation had “passed its final vote.” He added that the hiring process had already begun for the UF team.  Walsh also revealed in the tweet that the foundation would be ramping up the Uniswap Grants Program, hinting at a new grants announcement next month.  The general purpose of the Uniswap Foundation, as laid out in the proposal, is to foster open-source development and promote decentralized growth, along with ensuring long-term sustainability of the Uniswap Ecosystem. The foundation will focus on three key agendas – Growth, Governance and Advocacy.  According to the roadmap specified in the proposal, grants and R&D programs will be used to stimulate protocol activity which will lead to growth. The foundation will also focus on making the governance process more efficient and act as an advocate for the broader Uniswap ecosystem.  Let’s talk money  The foundation is set to cost $74 million, which will be released by the Uniswap DAO Treasury from its $3 billion . As per the proposal, $14 million will be earmarked for operational expenses that will support a team of 12 over the next two years. The foundation may approach the treasury again in six to twelve months if it deems that additional funding is required to ensure stability of operations.  The remaining $60 million will sustain the Uniswap Grants Program, which the foundation believes will last approximately three years. “ We plan to approach the Treasury for additional Grants funds when there are ~6 months of funds remaining.” the proposal added.    Source: Uniswap  The disbursement of funds will be carried out in two stages. In the first phase, $20 million will be released to cover operational expenses incurred and grants over the next two years. In the second phase, $54 million will be released by the Uniswap Treasury in six to twelve months once the foundation establishes itself as a legal entity.  Twitter court  While the community is celebrating this outcome, there were some Twitter users who questioned the degree of decentralization behind this vote.  A closer look at the voting figures revealed that the top twenty addresses accounted for more than 81.5 million or 94% of the total votes.

"118",520,2022-08-25,"CryptoDaily","Trident Protocol (otherwise known as TAP) is a new Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocol that offers straightforward staking and the highest stable returns in crypto.  Go grab yourself some $TRIDENT and get on the presale list on the PinkSale on September 1st, 8PM UTC!  Before applying for the TAP, let’s delve into the exceptional benefits this upcoming protocol holds for all $TRIDENT holders:  * Low-risk staking: 5% of all trading fees are held in the Trident Insurance Fund (TIF) to sustain and back all staking rewards and maintain price stability and potential risks. $TRIDENT always stays in your wallet, so you keep all of your earnings.  * Speedy interest payments: TAP will pay you every 15 minutes, making it the most rapid auto-compounding protocol in the blockchain space to date.  * Automatic interest yield: You do not need to restake your $TRIDENT tokens because Trident automatically pays and compounds the interest yield in your wallet. Thus, you will not miss any payments.  * High fixed annual percentage yield (APY): For the first year, Trident pays out an interest rate of 382,945% (more than any other DeFi organization).  * Automatic “Token Burn” system: An exciting feature of TAP includes its automated “Token Burn” system dubbed “The Black Hole”. The feature ensures that circulating supplies are controlled, burning out 2.5% of all Trident Token market sales like all individual transactions.  The key element to point out here is Trident Protocol’s ability to offer $TRIDENT holders rewards like no other DeFi organization currently circling in the crypto sphere.  The protocol offers all $TRIDENT holders a consistent 0.02355% rebase rate every 15 minutes. Better still, collectors will receive these payments over 13.5 years—until reaching the maximum supply of 3.25 billion tokens.  The TAP functions on a new set of mechanics to ensure protocol sustainability. Many of which Trident create themselves, such as Trident Auto-Liquidity Engine (TALE) and the Trident Insurance Fund (TIF).  The good thing about TALE is that the function sets the amount of $TRIDENT you can get with $BNB tokens, injecting automatic liquidity into the market every 48 hours.  Whereas TIF serves as an insurance fund to achieve price stability and long-term sustainability of the Trident Protocol—making the generous rebase rate every 15 minutes possible.  Another perk Trident brings to the world of crypto is that, unlike its competitors, TAP does not utilize selling bonds. The organization knows that selling bonds eliminates and reduces the ability to offer a stable APY. Therefore, by not doing so, $TRIDENT keeps its value.  The PinkSale pre-launch includes 192,576 $TRIDENT tokens. Everyone will have an equal chance to buy such tokens on the PinkSale on September 1st.  Although, 10,000 of these tokens will be up for grabs on Trident’s Discord and Twitter for FREE. So, join the community channels!

"121",603,2022-08-25,"CryptoDaily","Singapore, Singapore, 25th August, 2022, Chainwire  Nature’s Vault, a Singapore-based Greentech company, announced today a strategic collaboration with Polygon Network, a leading Web 3 protocol provider.  Launched earlier this year, Nature’s Vault’s mission is to develop innovative and impactful ESG investments that combat climate change, namely greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem degradation. It’s the first blockchain solution to tokenize geologically quantified un-mined gold deposits. The company’s first project, the Legacy Token, ultimately aims to acquire the mining rights over, and protect at least one million ounces of gold, located in environmentally pristine locations across Canada. The company has already acquired the first 125,000 ounces at a location called Pistol Lake in Ontario, and is in active negotiations on their second acquisition. This preservation of gold is then tokenised as the Legacy Token or NVLT.  Polygon is a Layer 2 blockchain development platform that believes in making Web3 more accessible. Polygon enables developers to build scalable user-friendly dApps with low transaction fees without ever sacrificing on security. The Polygon ecosystem allows developers to sidestep a number of limitations on the Ethereum blockchain, namely high gas fees, and sluggish throughput all while leveraging the security features of the Ethereum mainnet.  ""Polygon acts as a base layer for innovation and development of new solutions to our planet's most critical problems. That is why we are delighted to have Nature's Vault on Polygon,"" said Stefan Renton, Sustainability Lead at Polygon. ""Nature’s Vault is tackling environmental impact in a creative way, showcasing itself as an example of projects we are strongly committed to supporting.""  Polygon is a multi-purpose ecosystem that leverages eco-friendly Proof-of-Stake consensus. At the time of writing, over 3.4 billion transactions have been made on the platform, with over 3 million transactions per day, and the platform hosts over 37,000 decentralised applications serving a user base of over 142 million.  As a strategic partner, Polygon hosts the Legacy Token on the Polygon blockchain and will facilitate transactions of the token once it launches. Presales of NVLT start next month and Nature’s Vault expects to hold its public sale of the Legacy Token in November 2022 on a leading global exchange.  Phil Rickard, Founder and CEO of Nature's Vault commented: “We are delighted to partner with Polygon and position Legacy Token in their rapidly expanding Web3 ecosystem.

"122",552,2022-08-24,"CryptoDaily","While Ethereum has been scrambling for several years to move across to the Proof-of-Stake protocol, one protocol is light years ahead with its POS energy-efficient consensus that was built from the ground up. TRON has recently ranked as one of the most environmentally friendly blockchains in the entire Web3 arena, no small feat. That’s according to a new research paper by the Crypto Carbon Ratings Institute, which shows that TRON is more friendly to the environment than many of its counterpart chains, including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Cardano, Avalanche and many more well-known chains.  A carbon zero future  Energy consumption has become well-entrenched in the minds of almost everyone, from businesses, governments and even households as the world races to zero carbon outputs. The blockchain for the most part has fallen behind this important ethos, with transactions on chains like Bitcoin and Ethereum guzzling as much energy as a small European city. In comparison, the report showed that the energy used by TRON’s protocol equates to the energy usage of 15 average U.S. households versus Bitcoin’s 8.5 million U.S. households and Ethereum's 1.6 million U.S. households, respectively.  More specifically, the energy consumed by PoW blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum is over 83 and 22 million kWh, respectively. In comparison, TRON showed an annual consumption of just 162,868 kWh. This represents a mind-boggling 99.9% less energy than the energy consumed by Bitcoin and Ethereum.  One of the greenest protocols  For a chain like TRON, this was one of the first parameters they considered right from the start and thanks to their Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, they have managed to achieve the status of one of the greenest protocols in Web3.  The Founder of TRON, H.E. Justin Sun was perhaps light years ahead of many of his peers when devising and creating one of the most efficient, fastest and also competitively priced protocols. According to him,  “The growing amount of energy consumption of modern-day blockchains is not sustainable in the long term for neither users nor economies at scale. The best networks are the ones that can promote decentralization while keeping their carbon footprint low in order to help lead the world into a greener future.”  TRON network hosts over 4,000 Decentralized Applications (dApps) and over 100 million user accounts. The bar chart below shows the comparison of energy consumption of some of the most popular networks.  (Different blockchains’ energy consumption)  According to the co-founder and CEO of CCRI, Uli Gallersdörfer, “Our measurements have shown that the TRON network’s electricity consumption and carbon footprint are among the lowest in the peer group. Furthermore, transparency on node locations allowed us to produce an estimate with higher accuracy compared to previous studies.”  (Different blockchains’ carbon footprint)  As the world continues running towards an energy-efficient future for the protection of the planet, networks like TRON’s can be proud of their part in pushing sustainability for the planet in line with security and reliability.

"123",1362,2022-08-24,"CryptoDaily","In the cryptocurrency market, there are two modes of consensus that the majority of cryptocurrencies abide by. They are Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Newer cryptocurrencies often gravitate towards PoS because of its nominal fees, faster speeds, high security, and reduced environmental impact.  Bitcoin (BTC) is the pioneer of the crypto world. Its PoW consensus paved the way for thousands of cryptocurrencies to follow. Its popularity is unfathomable as its market capitalisation makes up almost half of the whole crypto market. However, its inception was thirteen years ago, and the crypto market has come a long way since.  Dogecoin (DOGE) also utilises a PoW consensus algorithm notorious for low transaction speed and high carbon emissions. The loveable Doge meme inspired Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer to construct the first meme coin in existence. As you know, Dogecoin grew far beyond their expectations and became somewhat of a pioneer in the meme coin market.  So, how does this affect Big Eyes Coin (BIG), and how can it outperform the pioneers of the crypto and meme coin market? Big Eyes Coin is built on Ethereum (ETH). Although Ethereum is currently a PoW platform, it is gearing up for a switch to PoS. It is the most anticipated event the crypto market has seen this year.  Big Eyes Coin could potentially hit $50 million, catapulting it up the crypto market. Its dedication to one of the most crucial parts of our environment, the oceans, has garnered attention from crypto enthusiasts. Environmentally friendly cryptocurrencies are the way forward in today’s world.  Big Eyes (BIG) Launch Is Just Around The Corner!  Big Eyes Coin has constructed an ecosystem that benefits the user heavily. 90% of the tokens will be available at launch to give control of the platform to the community. A step-by-step guide will later show you how to buy BIG in the article. The remaining 10% of the tokens will be split equally between a charity and a marketing wallet.  Staying relevant in the crypto space is essential for success. That is why Big Eyes Coin has a marketing wallet that can help it stay in touch with the latest trends. When you examine the Big Eyes Coin mascot, you will see that it has an Anime design. Anime is becoming an increasingly popular genre of comic books and cartoons.  Currently, 40-60% of the world’s population watches or reads Anime, so it is no surprise that Big Eyes Coin is catering to this market. Big Eyes Coin has plans to create comic books, as seen on its Instagram page, and merchandise with the Big Eyes mascot. It could potentially see a new wave of users gravitate towards the Big Eyes Coin platform.  These new users can immerse themselves in the Big Eyes Coin NFT events held each season. Big Eyes Coin aims to have an NFT collection in the top ten projects, which will make the NFTs owned by users valuable. Those holding NFTs will have access to a plethora of events, including the exclusive Big Eyes Sushi Crew, as seen in the picture below.  Big Eyes Coin will remove tax from buying and selling on the platform so you can save more of your BIG tokens. Additionally, there will be $2 million locked in liquidity for two years to ensure fast conversions. Big Eyes Coin will be available on Uniswap (UNI), one of the largest decentralised exchanges (DEXs).  As mentioned above, Big Eyes Coin will build on the Ethereum blockchain. Although Ethereum is currently using PoW, the upgrade to PoS could be as soon as September! PoS is now considered the favourable consensus by crypto whales due to its increased transaction speed and heightened security. So, could this mean increased attention for Big Eyes Coin by crypto whales? All signs point to yes.  How To Sign Up For The Big Eyes Coin Launch  You can sign up for the Big Eyes Coin launch with just a few clicks of a button. The website is easy to navigate for newcomers to the crypto world. All you need to do is go onto the Big Eyes Coin website and click sign up for launch.  Fill out the required information, as seen in the photo below. All you need is your first and last name with a valid email address to become part of the Big Eyes Coin community. It’s that simple!  Will Bitcoin (BTC) Remain At The Top?  Anyone who has heard of cryptocurrency will have basic knowledge of Bitcoin. The crypto giant has dominated the market since its inception in 2009. Even in times of hardship, Bitcoin has remained the face of crypto. However, will Bitcoin’s outdated consensus algorithm be its downfall? It is possible.  Bitcoin has recorded a 9.06% decrease in value in seven days at the time of writing. As the maximum amount of Bitcoins available to mine draws closer, miners could look for a new PoW cryptocurrency like Dogecoin. Over 90% of Bitcoins are mined, leaving just 1.8 million left!  However, there are many reasons why Bitcoin users will move away from the Bitcoin platform. The most notable one is the environment. Bitcoin uses an astronomical amount of energy annually, equating to the same amount as Argentina! Excessive energy consumption results in high carbon emissions.  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are being held accountable for their environmental impact. It is one of the reasons why Ethereum chose to switch to PoS. While this is not an option for Bitcoin due to its value being determined by the amount of work it takes to mine a coin, it does not stop the negative publicity around Bitcoin.  Bitcoin users can switch from the PoW platform to a PoS platform like Big Eyes Coin. The new cryptocurrency has the potential to dominate the market through Q4, utilising the upgraded technology of Ethereum 2.0.  The Pioneer For Meme Coins - Dogecoin (DOGE)  Like Bitcoin, Dogecoin was the first of its kind to enter the crypto market. Since its inception, there have been over two hundred meme coins that have graced the market. None of them has obtained the same popularity that Dogecoin has. Dogecoin could be an escape for Bitcoin miners as Dogecoin also uses PoW.  Users obtain 6.25 BTC when mining a block of Bitcoin and 10,000 DOGE when mining a block of DOGE. While the prices may differ, Dogecoin has an unlimited supply, meaning users can mine it continuously.  Additionally, Dogecoin has the support of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk. Even if you haven’t heard of cryptocurrency, you will know Elon Musk. He has often tweeted his support for Dogecoin, resulting in price spikes. Elon Musk has over 100 million Twitter followers, showcasing his effect on the crypto market. In particular, Dogecoin.  Recent updates for Dogecoin include a layer-2 network for the Dogecoin platform named, Dogechain. The Dogechain was constructed by DOGE holders and includes games, NFTs, and DeFi for Dogecoin users. Could this development help Dogecoin climb further up the crypto market?  It has been over 13 years since the introduction of Bitcoin. The mode of consensus that Bitcoin and Dogecoin use could be classified as outdated, leaving room for PoS platforms to outperform them in the crypto market. Even those with little sympathy for the environment will gravitate towards PoS due to its high speeds, nominal fees, and heightened security.  Big Eyes Coin is a new innovative platform that has constructed an ecosystem that appeals to a massive target audience, with many tools at its disposal. If the PoW consensus is outdated, Big Eyes Coin could outperform Bitcoin and Dogecoin when it launches. The success of Big Eyes Coin thus far has created a buzz around the platform that could help it hit $50 million. Will you join the Big Eyes Coin’s growing community?

"124",2211,2022-08-24,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Andy LeRoy, the founder of Exponential Layers which is a Lightning Network analytics platform and explorer.  This beautiful  in Charlotte, North Carolina, is a millennial’s dream. Complete with a backyard and a porch for enjoying a coffee, it is in a prime neighborhood just down the street from a brunch spot with an all-day avocado toast special. For just $730,000, it can be all yours.  We all recognize this house is expensive. A $4,000 monthly payment, even after putting $150,000 down, would represent nearly 70% of the median U.S. , and this house is about 1.7 times higher than the  of $440,000.  Why Is This House So Expensive?  The house was built in 1938, and its latest available records show its sale history, the earliest being for $88,500 in 1987.  This jump from $88,500 to $730,000 is a 725% increase over 35 years, and reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.2%. That’s quite an increase. Over the same time the  is up 465% at a CAGR of 5.1%, so is it really that big of a jump in comparison?  What about gross domestic product (GDP), the go-to for measuring economic output?  is up from $4.7 trillion to $24.8 trillion in nominal terms, another triple-digit increase of 427% over 35 years.  So everything is up … it makes sense, right?   from 424,000 to 2.2 million over this same time period — 5% CAGR — and this house is in a great neighborhood, so supply and demand? Plus our economy is more productive, so the rise in price is inevitable?  All of this checks out on paper, except for one metric: energy.   in 1987 was 21,056 TWh of energy, which adjusted for population at the time represents about 87,000 kWh per person. Of this energy consumption, electricity usage was around 11,500 kWh per capita.  Compare that to today — the latest figures in 2022 for the United States show per capita energy consumption of 76,632 kWh, with a slight increase in the amount consumed as electricity at 12,466 kWh per person.  For all of the talk of “walking uphill both ways” in previous generations, it actually turns out that more energy was consumed per capita 35 years ago in the U.S. than it is today.  The Energy Breakdown  There are a  for how energy (and then electricity) is created.  How energy is created  If you ride a bike at a reasonable pace, you will generate 100 watts. Keep this up for 10 hours and you will have generated 1 kWh worth of energy. A load of laundry done with a washer and a dryer will consume around 6 kWh of energy.  If we ignore the monetary denomination of housing prices and just look at the U.S. economy as the output and consumption of energy, we now consume less per capita than we did in 1987.  As we saw in USD prices, this particular house is eight times as expensive, while energy consumption per capita is flat. By this logic, if it took you one month of riding your bike for 10 hours a day to generate the energy to buy the house in 1987, you would now need to ride your bike for eight months to buy the same house. Eight times as much energy for the same product? Better get out that Peloton subscription.  This is a cherry-picked example of one house in a growing city; it has probably been renovated many times and is worth the extra work, especially considering Charlotte’s population and job growth.  Let’s zoom out and look at another example.  The Texas A&M Real Estate Center publishes . From their chart, we can see that an acre of land in Texas in 1987 was $553. That same land in 2021 is now nearly $4,000/acre (an eightfold increase over a 35-year period).  (Source)  An acre of land, with no improvements, in the middle of nowhere, now requires eight times as much energy output to purchase?!  Land can improve in value with higher population, utility (farming or hunting) or lower tax rates and/or some kind of subsidized incentive. But a 362% price increase after adjusting for ? Texas forever, but something doesn’t add up here.  Is Energy The Correct Metric?  The idea of energy-based money is nothing new.  was an early proponent of energy as currency, and as many Bitcoiners and Redditors have pointed out, he was also a believer in reincarnation (  ). The idea of a money denominated in energy terms, kWh for example, held great promise for getting us out of the fiat system.  We intuitively recognize the concept of energy. We either work longer hours or we focus efforts or use better tools to leverage our output, and the abstractions simply go on. The corporate world is full of internal rate of return analysis, resource staffing, budgets and timelines. Earnings reports and financial statements offer the scorecard to the market, which weeds out businesses that do not generate economic value over time.  Our system of capitalism has worked quite well. Thanks to the incredible ingenuity, output and work of everyone in the world, and despite inflation, so many things .  In 1956, the  weighed 27 tons, consumed 150 kW, ran about 100,000 operations per second and cost the equivalent of $6 million today. Today, a new Macbook weighs 3.5lbs, consumes around 40 watts, and cranks out 3.2 billion operations per second — all for $2,000.  Airliners have  at a compound rate of 1.3% between 1968 and 2014.  In many cases, we are getting much more efficient with all of our energy consumption, so things should be getting even more inexpensive?  What’s The Problem?  To be able to have a rich life and so many improvements while using the same energy per capita is a benefit to us all, but how that economic value is measured is susceptible to changing rules.  If we have gotten more efficient with our energy and have better technology, how is it that a piece of rural land costs eight times more? This is where the Federal Reserve’s expanding money supply comes into play. For all of the talk about “transitory inflation,” the Fed (with the help of banks) has managed to expand the M2 money supply .  So while our nominal GDP is up 427%, it hasn’t outpaced money supply growth, and we have already seen that energy consumption per capita is flat over 35 years.  The problem here is what we all can tangibly feel: The output of our work denominated by the energy we put in is worth significantly less over time.  When we as individuals or corporations are unable to preserve the efforts of our energy output, we must continually find ways to preserve our purchasing power through assets like land, commodities and equities. If the pace at which stored energy degrades is faster than innovation and output, we have problems. Physical limits come into play: We can print all the money in the world, but we can’t fake energy production and consumption.  Yes, our energy may be consumed more efficiently — as evidenced earlier by the airplane requiring 45% less fuel for the same trip — thus providing more value to society. If our society has been so efficient,  from 47% in 1987 to 123% today? How is it that we have needed to borrow against the future so much in an environment of increased productivity? At some point this all breaks.  What Breaks?  Unlike with fiat or any proof-of-stake altcoins, you cannot fake energy creation. Doing more work in the past does not magically create new work in the future. However, the cover-up in fiat money printing, combined with every U.S. government administration’s propensity to spend, has .  (Source)  Supposedly , because we can always print our way out of debt. But can we really?  In 2021, the  brought in $4.05 trillion in revenue with GDP at $22.4 trillion. It spent $6.82 trillion. The pandemic payments made up $570 billion on top of other category staples such as social security ($1.1 trillion), health ($797 billion) and defense ($755 billion). Interest paid by the government was $352 billion — 5% of total spending (in a pandemic year).  Over time, the government has spent more as a  — 32% in 1987 compared to 55% at the height of the pandemic — and now to 34% in 2022. Even after capturing the value hidden in inflation all these years!  In attempts to quell record inflation (9.1% in the  ), the Fed hiked interest rates to 2.5% in July; an increase of 75 basis points (.75%).  While this may “slow” the economy, it has two negative effects on being able to balance the budget. With a slower economy, they have a lower tax revenue to draw from. The latest 0.75% interest rate increase also adds another approximately $130 billion in interest expense to a budget that already can’t be balanced. This comes in the form of added expense on debt rollover, and  from Allan Sloan walks through an estimated calculation.  Using his rollover debt totals of about $7.1 trillion, every 100 basis point increase in the federal funds rate that feeds through to market yields on Treasuries adds another $70 billion to required government spending. If , that puts interest expense (on just current debt) at somewhere close to $500 billion. More than transportation, education, training, employment and social services combined.  The Fed can also continue their attempts for quantitative tightening, but this has the same problem: higher interest rates (and interest expense), and a presumably reduced tax base given economic slowdown.  The last remaining option would be to cut federal spending or increase taxes. With names like the “Inflation Reduction Act,” we already see the government attempting to mask their increased taxation attempts. Other “hidden” taxation attempts will likely come: increasing the age at which you can begin receiving social security benefits, adding additional taxes for “wealthy” people withdrawing from their 401(k) or IRA, putting in carbon taxes under the guise of “ESG” (environmental, social and governance). Things will need to be creative to offset the competing incentives of a surplus and (re)election.  At some point, this model breaks. We cannot cut energy production and consumption, cut interest rates to encourage growth and run continued deficits. The numbers don’t add up and eventually no one — individuals, companies or governments — can fake the energy output required to keep pace. We have seen a number of  over the past decade, but this time seems different, especially with  of the world living in countries with 10%-plus inflation.  What’s Next?  Money is just a tool for valuing goods and services over time — . It doesn’t create “yield” by itself. Only productive assets, which provide positive economic value, can do this. When it all breaks down, whoever holds the productive assets can determine the role of money, provided they have the resources and means to enforce and defend the rules.  But, as all of you are well aware, we finally have an alternative option. Instead of it coming from top-down enforcement, backed by the military, Bitcoin is adopted bottom-up — in the very order that its properties become beneficial to the people and companies providing economic value.  All we want as millennials is a way to preserve our work, energy and purchasing power. And have a good avocado toast while we ride our pelotons.  How Bitcoin adoption plays out will be interesting and exciting to watch. Bitcoin is already used worldwide, with a , settling some  in value.  Now, with the Lightning Network, Bitcoin can be sent peer-to-peer instantaneously, without a central authority. July saw the highest monthly , and every metric is up and to the right for providing a payment layer that offers continued utility and helps clear the medium of exchange hurdle present in the Bitcoin system.  Defining success metrics relies on a whole host of factors, and at  you can take a look at preliminary Lightning Network metrics that give insight into network growth (among other data), as Lightning moves to take the role of Visa’s $10.4 trillion yearly payment volume.

As Hoskinson stated, ""The advantage of proof of stake is that because you don't have that gargantuan overhead and energy expenditure for deciding who gets to make a block, it means you can put a lot of your magic in the other two stages.""  However, a Coinshares Bitcoin mining report released at the start of the year indicated that Bitcoin only contributed 0.08% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2021, suggesting that talking points about the network's energy usage may be a little bit overstated.  Yoroi wallet prepares for Vasil  The official Twitter account tweeted recently, ""We have started to update our servers in preparation for the Vasil hard fork. Users may experience a slow-down in services through this transition.''  Yoroi Wallet is an official crypto light wallet developed by EMURGO for Cardano ADA and Ergo ERG users.  According to Cardano's IOG, Vasil remains one of the most complex upgrades it has undertaken to date, hence safety and security are its top priorities."
"126",709,2022-08-23,"CryptoDaily","Diamonds continue to shimmer in the digital world. Already one of nature's most beautiful creations, diamonds continue to gain popularity as one of the most-desired NFT assets.  Crypto and diamonds already have a storied history. A mystery buyer paid $12.3 million in virtual currency for a diamond from a Sotheby's auction in 2021. Now, these precious gems continue to gain notoriety as famous figures bring jewelry to the blockchain such as GemSet.  Tokenizing Jewelry And Diamonds Proves Popular  Last year, well-known rapper Lil Pump released a range of NFT chains on the Sweet marketplace. Each piece of jewelry featured three shades of intertwined gold adorned with thousands of diamonds.  As the digital merchandise sold, Lil Pump noted in a press release how NFTs “are the future.”  Many argue diamonds and NFTs are a proverbial ‘match made in heaven’ due to the unique nature of each asset and the ease of selling high-value, investment-grade diamonds on metaverse marketplaces. A growing number of diamond-focused NFT entities offer a wide range of natural and rare colored gems and unique jewelry - with an array of colors, clarity, and carat.  Some projects, like NFT Diamonds and Co., market ‘Digital Diamonds’ that exist as a limited series, ensuring these digital assets remain scarce and valuable.  Despite enthusiastic marketing campaigns by jewelers, physical diamonds are not as scarce as many believe. They often resell at just 25-50% of the original purchase value. Retail markups alone can exceed 100-200% of the actual market value for a diamond.  The ease of buying and selling NFT diamonds keeps these assets liquid and tradable, especially as auction houses and other online platforms notice a marked increase in the number of tech-savvy millennial bidders on jewelry and watches.  In fact, even those working at leading auction houses understand the disruptive nature of crypto and NFTs. Former Christie’s head of digital sales Noah Davis left the British auction house in Summer 2022 to work for CryptoPunks.  In his eyes, “blockchain is on the cusp of being integrated into every single creative industry that exist.”  NFT Diamonds Bring Clarity, Transparency, And Accountability To Current Practices  NFT technology also helps confirm diamond authenticity and provenance by documenting ownership history, an almost-impossible task in some facets of the physical diamond industry.  As a result, NFT diamonds have an allure for those concerned about the destructive practices of the physical diamond trade, due to adverse environmental impact and the presence of child labor.  Uniquely, the marriage of diamonds and NFTs is also reorienting countless people across the world about conceptual changes to the definition of ‘assets’ itself.  In August 2021, Tascha Tweeted about purchasing a natural diamond, destroying it, and then minting the asset as an NFT to “see how much value the NFT retains.” She argued that even if the physical diamond was destroyed, “you still have the same asset. Because the token still exists and is in limited supply just as before.”  The digital diamond later sold in September 2021 for 5.5125 WETH.  Innovation like Tascha’s experiment only continues to prove NFT diamonds pose significant advantages over their physical counterparts, especially as NFT technology boosts authenticity, documentation, and enhances diamond traceability.  Fortunately, crypto trailblazers like GemSet NFT creator Johnathan Schultz offer the best of both worlds - physical and NFT diamonds. The Las Vegas-based artist and entrepreneur is already world-famous for integrating diamonds into his artistic endeavors.  He’s now working on an exclusive GemSet 10K Generative NFT collection.  Each GemSet NFT is associated with real, physical diamonds that can also be staked to unlock rewards like art, merchandise and IRL activations at exclusive events.  The mint date for GemSet and the price is TBD, but those interested in the project can visit the official website, Twitter, and Instagram for more details and updates.

"127",337,2022-08-23,"Blockchain.News","Non-fungible token (NFT) transactions are expected to reach $40 million by 2027 as the metaverse trend continues to gain steam,  to a report by Juniper Research.  The study noted that a 66.6% growth would be recorded during the forecast period. Per the report:  NFT transactions will rise from 24 million in 2022 to 40 million by 2027. This is based on our medium scenario for adoption, with brands leveraging the metaverse to boost digital growth.  For consumer-centred businesses, the research pointed out that creating NFT-based content would give them a competitive advantage based on the changing needs of the younger and tech-savvy demographic.  Younger generation consumers are inclined to purchase novel digital and online content forms. Per the announcement:  The report predicts metaverse-linked NFTs will be the fastest-growing NFT segment over the next 5 years, increasing from 600,000 transactions in 2022 to 9.8 million by 2027. It highlights the rising demand for immersive experiences as a driver of metaverse adoption.  Despite NFTs offering a new growth channel, the research stated that vendors ought to be cautious not to operate in unregulated environments, which are home to scams and fraudulent activities. The report added:  Vendors who partake in the NFT space may risk brand damage by association, due to the role NFTs have had in illegal activities, such as money laundering, scams, and fraud.  For a conducive NFT operating environment, Juniper Research highlighted the need for regulators to collaborate with industry bodies to standardize processes with built-in consumer protections and reduced environmental impact.  Since NFTs are digital assets whose ownership is blockchain-based, their worth is pegged on their uniqueness. Furthermore, their intrinsic value is founded on their limited supply because they must be bought as an entire token.

"128",323,2022-08-23,"Blockchain.News","United States Senator Ted Cruz has showered accolades on Bitcoin mining as a venture, taking a wildly divergent view from major critics who believe Bitcoin mining is damaging to the environment.   to Senator Cruz, Bitcoin mining is actually an advantage to the environment, explicitly calling it a net plus venture, especially if miners focus on utilizing renewable energy sources.  Cryptocurrency is a net plus for the environment. Being able to unlock a lot of renewables is important for the environment. Taking stranded natural gas and putting it to productive use is a big positive, Cruz said, adding that Bitcoin also is a room full of entrepreneurs, full of people that are providing for their families, and that prosperity is a net positive for the environment as well.  One of the other reasons why Ted Cruz believes Bitcoin mining is advantageous is its potential to be switched on and off the grid. Cruz highlighted that Bitcoin could share the grid with other forms of energy, a feature beneficial in a natural disaster.  Because of the ability to Bitcoin mining to turn on or off instantaneously, if you have a moment where you have a power shortage or a power crisis, whether it's a freeze or some other natural disaster where power generation capacity goes down, that creates the capacity to instantaneously shift that energy to put it back on the grid, he added.  All over the world, regulators have often frowned against the perceived role of Bitcoin miners. The fears of environmental damage have made the Chinese government ban mining activities, while many other regions are restricting resources that can make miners less effective.

"129",793,2022-08-23,"Cryptonews.com","has become a “new Latin American Mecca for cryptocurrency ,” a new report has claimed – but not everyone seems to be happy about the fact that more miners than ever are choosing to set up shop in the nation.  As , the Paraguayan Senate last month signed off on a bill that will regulate crypto mining and trading in the nation. The bill, which has been in the pipelines since September 2021,  and ensure that miners pay taxes and declare their activities.  Many Paraguayan politicians have argued that the mining sector could be a major money-spinner for the government and power companies. The nation is home to a number of large hydroelectric power stations that periodically produce surplus power.  As this surplus power often cannot be used by Paraguayans, many advocates have called for international miners to be encouraged to set up shop near dams and power plants. While other industries have little use for irregular power supply, this is not the case for miners, whose rigs can take advantage of power when it is available and sit idle when this is not the case. Miners from as far afield as  and  have already been courted, with talks still ongoing with some of the parties fleeing China’s crypto crackdown of September 2021.  El Pais  that an abundance of “very cheap electricity” has turned the nation into a “promised land for profitable Bitcoin mining,” and remarked that former “jungles” in Ciudad del Este, San Pedro, and Paraguarí have already become major mining centers.  This is also the case in “rural towns” with high populations of ethnic Germans, such as Villarrica.  The bill, which must now be approved or vetoed by President Mario Abdo Benítez, will seal the fate of the nation’s crypto mining sector.  But Luis Benítez, a university professor and long-time home crypto miner, claimed that only industrial miners stand to benefit – and that “amateur and domestic” miners stand to gain nothing from it. Benítez claimed that politicians had “only met with large mining firms” before formulating the bill, and had created legislation “very hastily, without taking into account issues pertaining to energy and tax policy.”  In fact, power companies have also expressed their concerns. A national energy provider has previously asked the government to oblige miners to pay in advance for electrical power – and to settle their bills in USD.  Other political critics have claimed that the energy should instead be donated to poorer families.  But the reality of the situation is that right now, Paraguay has little use for hydroelectric power. The media outlet explained that the country has “hardly any industry or infrastructure” that can harness the electrical energy, so “its seven million inhabitants cannot benefit from” the resource. Instead, public transport, cars, and agricultural vehicles generally make use of fossil fuels – meaning that a mere 20% of Paraguay’s hydroelectric power actually gets used in the country where it was generated.  This means that some miners have been wooed with promises that they will pay as little as USD 18 per megawatt hour for electricity. This is a huge difference from “the average price paid in South America,” which, per the former energy minister Mercedes Canese “is around USD 100 dollars per megawatt hour.”  Canese claimed that this price was too low, and claimed that energy importers are charged higher rates than miners.  Canese opined that “in the context of climate change,” it does not make sense to “dedicate so much energy to something that does not produce [anything] and does not create jobs.”  She added that many miners only agreed to set up shop in Paraguay if they were allowed to make use of subsidized rates, and bemoaned the fact that crypto mining does not “generate wealth” for the nation.  Miners, she said, were making big profits from “raw materials,” and “on top of that enjoying subsidies.”  Regardless, there is evidence that mining could provide some new opportunities for certain Paraguayans. The media outlet gave the example of the Villarrica resident and native Christian Katz, who has built a business that helps miners connect to the internet.  But there are other wrinkles that are perhaps forcing Paraguay’s hand when it comes to fast-tracking crypto mining regulation. Under a bilateral agreement with , which shares many of the rivers that are damned by Paraguayan power stations, Paraguay must donate all the electricity that it does not make use of (or sell) to its neighbor.  And in 2019, illegal crypto miners were found stealing electricity from hydroelectric power plants – perhaps highlighting the need to legalize and tax  industry before it can go underground.  ____"
"130",909,2022-08-22,"AMBCrypto","Blockchain and crypto projects never cease to amaze us with what they can achieve. Yet another example of it is this new green crypto project GreenPower Network (GPN) which aims at encouraging a brand-new Use-to-Earn model which bridges the use of everyday real-world power products with NFTs and blockchain-powered tokens.  Since the first Bitcoin was mined back in 2009, technology has rapidly evolved. Many projects have come up in recent years from Tokens to NFTs and now to the Metaverse. Web 3.0 is quickly becoming a well-known subject. While blockchain continues to disrupt the tech and finance industry simultaneously, there has been a growing concern from the eco-warriors about the side effects of crypto mining.  As of 2022, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) estimates that Bitcoin consumes 131 TWh annually, representing 0.29% of the world’s energy production and 0.59% of the world’s electricity production. That said, a growing number of crypto projects are addressing these concerns by either investing or incentivizing miners to use renewable energy for their mining process.  What is GreenPower Network and How does it work?  Greenpower Network (GPN) is a ground-breaking web 3.0 platform that will not only encourage the use and production of renewable energy through tokens and rewards but also empowers various power hardware manufacturers to offer their power products ranging from portable power banks, outdoor power stations, home power storage, electric vehicle charging stations and solar power generators, etc. that users can use for their everyday energy consumption needs.  The decentralized network partners with power hardware manufacturers who will offer portable Smart Energy Sources in various sizes and capacities that effectively cover the users’ portable, outdoor, and in-home energy consumptions. These smart power products will be linked to the GPN’s very own application available both on iOS and Android and the secured and encrypted power production and consumption data will be transmitted to the APP and connected to web 3.0 via blockchain technologies. The application will allow users to pair with the in-app NFT which is upgradeable with the use of the power products or via the in-app marketplace. The users will be able to claim rewards or tokens through their paired NFTs with the use of the power products and buy, sell, upgrade or trade their NFTs.  The Vision  The vision behind GPN is to encourage the use and production of green power and to solve the problem of energy consumption in areas that is inconvenient or facing an energy crisis. This next generation of power consumers may be brought on board by switching from energy produced with fossil fuels to electricity, using smart energy storage technology to increase energy efficiency, and inviting people to participate in Web3.0 and receive benefits.  Additionally, the usage of green energy by GPN users will support the planet’s sustainability and contribute to environmental protection. GPN will also contribute toward a greener environment by incentivizing and investing in solar power or other clean tech products to ensure not only do its users earn from GPN but can contribute to addressing environmental issues such as deforestation.  According to GPN’s spokesperson:  “Greenpower Network actively encourages the production, storage, and utilization of green energy, to maximize energy utilization, and contribute to carbon neutrality. The goal is to allow tracking of energy usage and transactions on the blockchain to in the form of digital currency that users can participate in the real-worldeconomy”.  Earning with GPN  With NFTs that can be staked and incentives that can be earned through renting, charging, and exchanging smart energy products, GPN uses a novel “Use-to-Earn” concept. This enables consumers to gain from the energy that their device uses.  Users that have a larger stake in the network will also be involved in governance and have a strong voting voice because the architecture was developed using a decentralized approach.  The Road towards EnergyFi  GPN’s model works on combining smart energy storage resources with blockchain and Web 3.0. As a result, it encourages users to utilize its renewable smart resources while allowing them to earn tokens through NFTs held by users on the dApp platform. Users will also be able to consume the tokens for the services that any GPN-associated power products provide such as portable battery renting or EV charging portals. The tokens will also be listed in DEX or CE in the future.  In short, Blockchain + Web3.0 + Energy Sustainability + Real World Token Consumption = EnergyFi.  This unique model combined with the latest trends of the rising number of green crypto projects means that GPN holds a unique opportunity to create a new earning mechanism through the “Use-to-Earn” model.  Currently, the GPN team is on the final stretch of creating their dApp Greenpower Protocol, NFT Marketplace, and the partnered NFT-integrated Smart Energy Source (Hardware). The hardware will launch very shortly on popular crowdfunding platforms. Follow Greenpower Network socials to keep updated on the next big thing to hit Web3.0!

"133",1500,2022-08-20,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Macro Jack, a Bitcoiner with a background in traditional financial services spanning investment research, investor relations and business development.  Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is an approach to evaluate companies or countries based on their alignment with these three factors. Growing in popularity in recent years, ESG has become a globally adopted framework and a focal point of capital allocation. The concept sounds harmless on paper since most people are good and want to advance environmental or social issues. Even better if we can do it through investments. However, introducing a monetary reward for ESG's disciples introduces a whole new set of incentives that have likely not been thoroughly examined by the investment community.  There is more than meets the eye. The ESG  is arbitrary, opaque and centralized, leaving significant room for corruption. It is also suspicious that one of the key proponents of ESG is the BlackRock CEO, Larry Fink. BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager managing more than $10 trillion, and Mr. Fink's lifestyle reflects that. He enjoys flying private to Davos, relaxing in his Aspen mansion and telling you to reduce your carbon footprint.  Digging deeper into ESG reveals a more sinister plan. While we want to be good stewards of the planet, we quickly learn that the globalists' proposal for doing so is quite ominous and also illegitimate. ESG is a vital component of the agenda to consolidate capital and centrally plan the allocation of resources, destroying the remains of the free market in the process. Let's dig a bit deeper.  ESG is more than an approach to evaluating investments; it is a social credit system similar to the one that exists under the Chinese Communist Party. Similar to a credit score that determines one's eligibility for loans based on their past ability to service debts, a social credit system is a more invasive analysis and determines access to not only financial services, but also public services, such as public transportation or grocery stores. For instance, China's social credit system seeks to compile digital records of citizens' social and financial behavior to calculate a personal rating that determines what services they are entitled. Per the , the official Chinese social credit system incorporates loan repayment, credit card bills, adherence to traffic rules, adherence to family-planning limits and “reliability” of information posted or reposted online, among other factors. In addition to the official inputs, social credit incorporates political dissidence, personal values and online speech into each person’s score. Someone's beliefs, political views and online behavior determine their ability to access services such as insurance and banking, school admissions, internet services, social services and job eligibility.  Social credit is a system that determines access to goods and services at an individual level, while ESG determines a corporation's ability to access capital. Ultimately, rather than a company delivering a product or service that the market demands, companies succeed based on their ability to compromise values and incorporate an ESG agenda. On an ESG standard, success is no longer based on delivering products and services to the market but on allegiance to the ruling class. ESG is a return to the monarchical model, allowing an elite few to allocate capital to causes that further enrich them in the name of “social good.”  Not only does the ESG system consolidate capital to the ruling class, but it is also effective at destroying wealth on a country-wide scale. For example, Sri Lanka's ESG score was 98.1 ahead of its collapse.  explains the score. A high Emissions Index (close to 100) indicates a low environmental impact for the country. The Emissions Index is based on the equal weighting of carbon and methane emissions.  Sri Lanka's collapse is due in some part to the government's decision to force farmers to switch from chemical fertilizers, which use natural gas as a key input, to organic fertilizer in April 2021. This mandate reduced crop yields and has led to less food, resulting in Sri Lanka depleting its foreign currency reserves in order to import food. In two years, Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves  from $7.6 billion in 2019 to $50 million by the end of 2020, a roughly 99% decrease. All the while, the country had  and food prices have .  If anything, the ESG score teaches us that it can be a counter indicator to a country's economic health, indicating a lack of food and reliable energy. Another recent ESG development was the Netherlands government's recent  of their plans to cut emissions of nitrogen by 50% by 2030 and Canada’s  emissions by 30%. In the Netherlands, the scapegoat is livestock and a reduction in herd size will render many farmers bankrupt, increasing food insecurity globally and making beef artificially scarce. By succumbing to the pressures of ESG, companies and countries do not prosper, they crumble. Rather than lifting all tides, they sink all ships.  At a corporate level, the ESG scheme is feasible because the stock market, namely passive investing, has been promoted as the best way to build wealth, especially in the U.S. Passive vehicles such as exchange-traded funds have been championed by BlackRock and other companies. for their simplicity and have seen a massive growth in demand in the past decade. However, the unspoken consequence of passive investing is that the shareholder voting rights are now concentrated with these behemoth asset managers, which use the votes to implement their ESG agenda. The ESG cronies are appointed to board positions and management roles, destroying the remains of capitalism. Rather than delivering shareholder value and increasing aggregate wealth, companies are forced to focus on “stakeholder capitalism,” translating to woke capitalism. Companies must succumb to Marxist ideologies to maintain a connection to the monetary window. ESG is a social credit system masquerading as a “social good.” A new form of crony capitalism, one based on allegiance to the globalists and masked as a virtuous cause.  The root cause of Marxism spreading throughout the capital allocation process is the debt-based fiat money. Because inflation is programmed into our money, savers are forced to invest in Wall Street products to preserve their purchasing power. The inflationary currency monopolized by central banks is a problem that Wall Street is eager to solve and their solution allows them to use the shareholder voting power to push the ESG agenda. The need for a savings technology independent from depreciating fiat currency and Wall Street’s financial products is obvious.  Enter Bitcoin, a savings technology that will free us from the globalists’ attack vectors, including ESG. By restoring the base layer of civilization with sound money technology, Bitcoin enables us to save for the long term. There is no need for Wall Street products on a bitcoin standard since there is no central authority, such as the Federal Reserve, diluting the supply. Bitcoin is programmatically scarce. There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin and the monetary policy is fully transparent and inelastic to changes in demand. Just as gold was selected by the free market as money due to its salability across space, so too is bitcoin being adopted as savings technology. There is a growing demand for sound money as fiat currencies trend toward zero. As demand grows over time and supply issuance decreases, the price will go up. Bitcoin is the savings technology that humanity needs to prosper.  Before people point out the obvious, it is worth addressing that bitcoin's price is volatile. Bitcoin's price does decrease in dollar terms because of the instability of the fiat financial system. However, bitcoin is only 13 years old and not yet a unit of account. As understood well in the bitcoin and Austrian economics space, money follows an adoption curve: first as a collectible, then as a store of value, next as a medium of exchange and finally as a unit of account. Bitcoin's predecessor, gold, went through this monetization process over thousands of years. Bitcoin's adoption is progressing much faster. As it advances in the monetization process, it will become more stable in dollar terms. Just remember that it is always stable in bitcoin terms; 1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin.  To conclude, the restoration of sound money as the base layer of civilization removes theft from the monetary system. Unlike central bankers that devalue your savings and force you to speculate on Wall Street products to preserve purchasing power, bitcoin exists as an alternative to store value through space and time, defunding the  and destroying ESG in the process.

This decline can be attributed to the crypto-winter. According to , the altcoin, at press time, was trading at $0.029, down 6% over the last 24 hours. In fact, the market capitalization stood at $2.3 billion with $98 million traded over the aforementioned period.  The idea of buying into a crypto because it costs a fraction of a dollar is tempting, but not smart. In this article, we will analyze what drives the price of VET and factors that have affected said price. Also, what might influence it in the future so that investors can make an informed decision.  About the platform  In 2015, Sunny Lu, the Chief Information Officer of Louis Vuitton China, founded VeChain. It was founded with an aim to disrupt conventional business models and revolutionize the way companies around the world manage their supply chains.  The company boasts partnerships with luxury brands like Louis Vuitton, BMW, big-four auditing firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and Walmart. Most recently, VeChain entered a multi-year deal with the UFC. The deal is valued at $100 million.  VeChain works on a consensus protocol that is different from the traditional proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protocols. VeChain uses a proof-of-authority consensus model. This protocol requires relatively low computational power and is more about integrity and quality. This consensus model is rather centralized, when compared to traditional ones.  Although VeChain is based out of Singapore, a significant portion of its team and connections are based in China. Almost half of VeChain’s partners are Chinese companies. Such is the customer concentration in China that more than half of the demand for VTHO is coming from a single customer – Walmart China. This so-called Chinese label may not be in their best interest, however, given the Chinese government’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies and frequent trade wars with the west. These factors cast a shadow on the project’s overall sustainability.  Following its rebranding as VeChain Thor and the subsequent launch of its own mainnet in 2018, VeChain pivoted to retail-facing products like decentralized applications (dApps) and e-NFTs. This move may not have been in their best interest.  from DappRadar shows negligible activity on VeChain dApps, despite the company  gas fees for dApps.

Investors will be eager to see how PwC’s blockchain partner VeChain benefits from this.  Global market intelligence firm IDC released a report in 2020. According to the same, 10% of the supply chain transactions in Chinese markets will use blockchain by 2025. This could work out in favor of VeChain, with it being the leading blockchain firm catering to supply chain solutions and given its significant presence in China. James Wester, research director at  IDC noted,  “This is an important time in the blockchain market as enterprises across markets and industries continue to increase their investment in the technology. The pandemic highlighted the need for more resilient, more transparent supply chains”  According to a  published by ResearchandMarkets.com, the global supply chain management market size is projected to hit $42.46 billion by 2027, with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.4% from 2021 to 2027. Experts have indicated major opportunities for integration of blockchain technology in supply chain management software in the projected period. As the leading blockchain firm catering to supply chain management, VeChain could stand to gain from this.  VeChain Tokenomics  Token minting predates VeChain’s rebranding, thus, figures have been converted from VEN to VET.  VeChain initially minted 100 billion VET which was distributed in the following manner –  * 22 billion VET were retained by the VeChain Foundation  * 5 billion VET were given to project team members  * 23 billion VET went towards enterprise investors  * 9 billion VET went towards private investors  * 27.7 billion VET were sold in the crowdsale  * 13.3 billion VET were burned by the VeChain Foundation as part of the token sale refund process  VET Price Prediction for 2025  Crypto-experts at Changelly have projected VET to be worth at least $0.10 in 2025. They believe the maximum it could go to is $0.12.  Data gathered by  suggests that the average projection for VET in 2025 is $0.22.  According to data published on , however, the average projection for VET in 2025 is $0.09.  VET Price Prediction for 2030   ’s crypto experts have concluded from their analysis that VET should be worth at least $0.64 in 2030. The projection included a maximum price of $0.79.  Data gathered by  suggests that the average price of VET in 2030 should be $0.38.  The experts at  predict VET to be worth an ambitious $1.79 by the end of the decade. Considering the current price, that would amount to a whopping 6200% profit.  Conclusion  It is important to note that increased adoption of VeChain doesn’t necessarily translate to increased demand for VET since the token is primarily used for staking and governance.  VeChain is arguably the only blockchain in the supply chain vertical that has survived the test of time. Rival tokens like Waltonchain and Wabi have seen their market capitalization and volume dramatically diminish over the past few months.  The ongoing supply chain crisis would have been a very good opportunity for VeChain to demonstrate its capabilities but companies all over the world have been resorting to conventional systems rather than exploring an innovative blockchain solution like VeChain. That being said, the supply chain tracking industry is ripe for disruption and VeChain is in a position to dominate the space in the near future.  Critics have speculated that while VeChain’s blockchain may prove useful, the specific nature of its native token’s utility i.e. pertaining to the business world, may become a hindrance in its growth.  VeChain needs to focus on what it’s good at – Enterprise-facing blockchain solutions for logistics and supply chains.  The major factors that will influence VET’s price in the coming years are –  * Increase in demand for VET through growth in dApp activity  * Development of VeChain cross-chain  * Stable economic environment in China  * Development of new use cases for VET  In other news, the Fear and Greed Index improved significantly yesterday, but has since slumped back."
"135",1025,2022-08-19,"CryptoDaily","There’s no denying the prevalence of blockchain gaming. Over the past year alone the industry has grown 2,000% from Q1 2021 and over $10.5 billion was raised in NFT and blockchain gaming funds in the first half of 2022. Although this industry is booming, there still lingers a hot debate in the background – whether web 3.0 games need to be fun or focus on functionality to ensure sustainable user retention.  There are two types of web3.0 or blockchain games, those that start from the traditional game developer side, and those that are created first based on tokenomics. It is not apparent as to which one of these two approaches to developing blockchain games ensures longer user retention. Some argue that as long as blockchain games provide users with high revenue streams, they would succeed in holding on and increasing their userbase.  Taking a different stand, traditional South Korean game developer Wemade is shifting the paradigm with CEO, Henry Chang stating, “To be a successful video game, games need to be fun. But to make the life cycle of the game longer, games must have well designed in-game economy”. He added “Games that can adapt the blockchain technology such as coins, NFTs and Defi, they can enlarge the economy beyond the game into the real world. The items in the games can be valuable in the real world. Its tokenomics in the game, can make the game more enjoyable. Players can make money from playing games”.  MIR4 Global which was launched just a year ago is certainly the most successful and sustainable blockchain game ever created. Originally developed by a traditional game developer Wemade, the game combines high quality graphics and characteristics with strong in-game economy. Available in 170 countries and in 12 languages, MIR4 has recorded over 20 million accumulative users and $160 million in-game revenue so far.  More Than Just Tokenomics and Functionality  MIR4 has millions of users playing every month with a peak value of 6.5 million in Q4 of 2021, which is exceptional for an MMORPG. The number of concurrent users never drops below half a million, which is proof of a sustainable in-game economy. It is a clear example of successful user retention case of Play and Earn (P&E) games with focus on fun rather than on strict economic gain.  Aware of the social impact P2E games have on individuals, MIR4 is designed so users don't have to spend 12 hours a day just to earn game tokens. Instead, the approach is to give users an incentive to enjoy the game without losing touch with reality. As a result, players can earn some side revenue through the games, without it taking over their lives.  Additionally, MIR4 aims to curb inflation within the ecosystem by ensuring users play and earn and pay. The game incentivizes users to invest their earned tokens back into the game which enhances their gaming experience. By bringing in utility and immersive gameplay to create a fun-filled journey for the players, well-made games with strong in-game economics deliver high user retention rates.  Games that are predominantly not fun, centered around economic profit, however, result in players engaging for a short time, always seeking to cash out and move on to the next highest paying game. When games are not enjoyable, users are not incentivized to spend their earned tokens in the game, therefore driving inflation within the ecosystem. Games that cannot solve inherent inflation problems are doomed from the start!  Regarding P2E’s sustainability, Benjamin Charbit, former Ubisoft Game Director and CEO of Darewise Entertainment, added,  ""Sustainability can only be achieved by managing the balance between user growth and inflationary assets. Games need (1) a balanced economic design so that players keep playing and earning, and (2) enough resource sinks to make them spend. Finally, tokens absolutely need utility to incentivize players to collect.""  Following on a similar line of thought, when asked about whether P2E games should choose between functionality or fun, the CEO of Shiryo (an NFT trading card game), Jordan Fung said,  ""Games should be a low barrier to entry with a focus on giving passionate gamers a great experience. It’s community passion that fleshes out the value in games and creates buzz - paywalls do not. If a game is fun they’ll refer it to friends. If a gamer's time is rewarded with fun items or experiences - their time gives it value. With no fun there are no referrals - without a gauge of value there’s no foundation for the price.""  Keeping Up With the Market Momentum  The in-game system ultimately allows players to enjoy the gameplay and then convert their earnings into fiat currency. CEO of FOTA (A Triple-A Metaverse MOBA game), Grey Trinh said,  “GameFi is the inevitable trend for the entertainment market, which allows people to own in-game assets and earn from their favorite characters. With Blockchain and Entertainment, a whole new creative economy is to come. However, the gameplay and finance aspects play in an equal manner. It has to make people feel fascinated in the virtual environment so that they can start the economic activities inside the game. In addition to that, GameFi can go above and beyond to find ways to connect with actual high-end fashion brands to promote their NFTs and boost their brand engagement to GenZ gamers, a.k.a fashion brand, users.”  Wemade has focused on exactly this for over 20 years by creating games that immerse the players into interactive gameplay, great stories, and impressive graphics. Embedded with blockchain technology, well-made fun games will soon be the norm in the industry. Mr. Chang shared his vision for the gaming industry, he said “Within the next three years, all games will be blockchain games, and Wemade will emerge as an open blockchain game platform”.

"136",837,2022-08-19,"Bitcoin Magazine","Or   Listen To The Episode Here:  “Fed Watch” is a macro podcast, true to bitcoin’s rebel nature. Each episode we question mainstream and Bitcoin narratives by examining current events in macro from across the globe, with an emphasis on central banks and currencies.  In this episode, Christian Keroles and I dive into the surprise rate cuts by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and read through some of Jamie Dimon’s recently leaked comments about the global economy and geopolitics.  China's Surprise Rate Cut  After a brief look at the bitcoin chart, we begin discussing the July 2022 economic numbers from China. I read off a Bloomberg article with the headline, “ .”  Up and down the data release, the Chinese economy performed worse than last month and far below estimates. After decades of industrial production rising in China at high single or even double digits, it is underperforming bearish estimates at only 3.8% year-over-year.  Other important metrics for the Chinese economy is retail sales growth, as they attempt to break out of the middle-income trap, and become a consumption-led economy. Growth was horrible at only 2.7%, with a projection of 4.9%.  The property and real estate sector posted a 6.4% decline, which is likely a rosy reading. In recent episodes, we’ve shown how the Chinese real estate market, like new home sales, has crashed by 30% month-other-month in recent months. This is absolutely devastating for a sector built around presales and which is trapped in a slow-motion credit default.  (  )  The last update for China this week is that the PBOC also cut their two short-term policy rates, each by 10 basis points. It’s not much, but it puts them in direct opposition to other central banks, who are pursuing a path of tightening.  As you can see in the chart below, the PBOC has been consistently cutting rates since long before COVID. This recent weakness might be blamed on their zero-COVID policy, but the data shows that China is experiencing only a return to trend — a trend that is heading toward a financial crisis.  (Source)  In the chart below, we can see the growth rate in the last 25 years of Chinese gross domestic product. Growth fundamentally changed in China during the Global Financial Crisis and has been trending down ever since. COVID was a massive shock, but now things are settling back on trend toward a crisis.  (  )  I know Jamie Dimon is not the most popular man in the Bitcoin community, but he is a heavyweight in the world of banking and finance. That is why, when some of his comments to high-net-worth clients , we should at least examine what he said. I’ll also note, Jamie Dimon is the CEO of JPMorgan Chase and the Wall Street banks influences the Federal Reserve. It is likely that this is similar to what we’d hear from a candid conversation with Jerome Powell.  About the coming recession, Dimon gauged the outcomes to be 10% soft landing, 20-30% mild recession, 20-30% harder recession and 20-30% something worse. That means he thinks there is a roughly 50% chance of a hard recession or something worse. That is significant but mixed, portraying a high level of uncertainty at the very top of banking and finance.  He was also uncertain about the path of the consumer price index and Fed policy. Important here because Powell is likely also uncertain.  Dimon was much more certain on other things, China for example. He said, “China has serious issues,” and “Autocratic management can work in certain things, but doesn't work in the long run.” Following that up with, “I think it is a mistake to say that America has the short end of the stick.”  We might view Jamie Dimon as the stereotypical Davos Man, friendly to the World Economic Forum and their agenda, but in these comments he blasts environmental, social and governance (ESG) and recommends pumping more oil in the U.S. He implied that more, rather than less, oil from the U.S. is better for the environment.  Lastly, Dimon even made some comments on “woke capitalism” the hallmark of the ESG movement. It was a little unclear what his direct thoughts were, but he certainly prefers abandoning policies that are tearing us apart and hurting the economy. Instead, he wants to focus on coming together and supporting each other.  That does it for this week. Thanks to the watchers and listeners.

"139",605,2022-08-17,"CryptoDaily","If there is anything to take away from the past few years, it is how the commodities industry needs to change. Resource companies still post record profits all the while markets suffer from unparalleled volatility. Moreover, consumers pay an arm and a leg for the resources they need, making life much harder than it needs to be. Supply chain shortages, inflationary concerns, and other aspects illustrate the inefficiency of the current market system.  These issues are not new, although they have become glaringly obvious to many more people suddenly. Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) concerns from financiers and resource buyers have created an uneasy situation that requires change. The solution is simple: ensure suppliers and consumers have the adequate tools to distinguish between good and bad in pricing and uptake. That is the missing link to establishing responsible supply chains and ensuring they are economically viable.  Watr Foundation Council President Maryam Ayati adds:  ""The opportunity to create new classes of ethical commodities and traded supply chains is tremendous. We are thrilled to have the legendary team at Parity join us and our existing partners in enabling commodities' transition to Web3 business models and liquidity while safeguarding the security and decentralized ethos of a public blockchain servicing both retail and regulated institutional users.""  What Watr does is establish a blockchain protocol and decentralized application ecosystem for ethical commodities, their financing and trade. The public protocol is a new opportunity for builders, developers, teams, and digital ventures, with a strong focus on retail and enterprise use cases. The initial applications will focus on helping the citizens of Watr's home soil in Africa. Moreover, Watr secured a partnership with Parity Technologies to develop this long-term vision further.  Forging Key Partnerships  While Watr is the first-of-its-kind collaboration between industry giants, commodities, and web 3 pioneers, new partnerships will be forged. For example, the strategic collaboration with Parity Technologies illustrates the importance of working together for the greater good. Through the partnership, Watr's protocol will be co-developed by Parity Technologies, as will its key application. In addition, the teams will conduct joint R&D on the intricacies required to service the commodities industry at large.  Watr will leverage Polkadot's community and decentralized security to a parachain. Moreover, the protocol is fully EVM-compatible, which will enable future cross-chain compatibility with other networks. Several applications for this new protocol are in development, including identity/KYC solutions and tokenizing/exchanging ethical commodity supply chains, including carbon credits.  Facilitating that exchanging and tokenizing are curated liquidity pools focused on ethical commodities. For now, the majority of that liquidity is sourced across Africa, as there is no shortage of ethical commodities. Essentially, the processes culminate in on-chain trading of premium ethical commodities created by their producers and sourced by the right audience of buyers and financiers.  Driving such a steep change in the commodities industry will take time. The Watr protocol and its application layer are in development, but they are one part of the equation. The other part revolves around transforming the commodities world through open dialog and engagement. Everyone needs to see the benefits this new idea brings to the table and how it helps global entrepreneurs to innovate and build novel applications. High-value ventures can then take those tools and grow them further, all under the banner of ethical commodities and bettering our planet.

"140",525,2022-08-16,"CryptoDaily","Significant Implications For Financial Institutions  The crypto industry has been focused on the Markets in Crypto Assets regulation and the more controversial Transfer of Funds Regulation. However, these regulations are part of a much larger package of the EU’s new anti-money laundering (AML) policy, which is set to impact all financial institutions significantly.  The regulatory body for cryptocurrencies is being created by the European Council, European Commission, and Parliament, which will have complete authority over the sector. The European Commission released its proposal for the Sixth Directive AML/CFT last July, while the European Council only released its version of the proposal only last month. The European Parliament will take it up after the August break. Once it passes its bill version, it will enter into negotiations with the European Council and European Commission.  A New Regulatory Body  At its center, the new legislation has the creation of a new, EU-wide regulator for anti-money laundering. While the regulatory bodies still have to negotiate and reach common ground, there seems to be little disagreement between them about the need for such a regulator. There is also agreement that the new regulator should have direct and complete oversight over crypto and crypto asset providers operating in the European Union.  The European Parliament has been aggressively pushing for the regulation of crypto. As a result, it is doubtful the body would oppose any future regulator or regulatory body’s complete supervision over the industry.  The new regulator, called the “Anti-Money Laundering Authority” or “AMLA,” will look to monitor high-risk crypto firms. This differs from previous money laundering regulations that only provided the framework for EU nations to gather and share information. According to a parliamentary briefing, the new system has been described as follows,  “EU-level supervision consisting of a hub and spoke model – i.e., supervisor at the EU level competent for direct supervision of certain financial institutions (FIs), indirect supervision/coordination of the other FIs, and a coordination role for supervising the non-financial sector as a first step.”  A Strict Approach To Crypto  The European Union has taken a no-nonsense approach to crypto laws. The European Parliament had recently voted in support of anti-anonymity regulations designed to significantly increase the cost and difficulty of transactions between unhosted wallets and exchanges, making them nearly impossible. Furthermore, even if a law to completely ban Proof-of-Work mining was defeated by the legislative body, the European Central Bank believes such a ban would eventually occur thanks to growing environmental concerns.  For the EU, creating a global organization marks a significant change. Previous AML directives required that member countries gather and make available required data, such as details about the beneficial ownership of corporations. Implementing the new regulations will depend on the pace of negotiations between the European Parliament, Commission, and Council, and it could be years before the regulations are fully implemented.

"145",643,2022-08-14,"CryptoDaily","Fracture Labs, a blockchain-based videogame company, has announced new developments following a successful $4.3 million funding round last November that saw support from companies such as Alameda Research, Mechanism Capital, VLaunch, Spartan, Gains Associates, Interstellar Ventures, Master Ventures, Huobi Ventures, Polygon, Spark Digital Capital, Metavest Capital, Titans Ventures, Germ Capital, FA Forward Analytics, and many more.  The company is focused on creating multiplayer games that are compatible with PC, console and mobile. Its most prominent project thus far has been the popular ‘Decimated’ game, which is being designed with a web3 layer using Solana.  The game, which is set in a post-apocalyptic world that has fallen to ruin due to an environmental crisis, is a 3rd person RPG metaverse with cyberpunk inspiration. Players can choose either PvP or PvE mode and have to salvage resources, battle against authoritarian police and survive the hellscape that Earth has become.  With these universally-loved themes and amazing in-game visuals, Decimated has proven to be popular with fans and critics alike. Famously, Decimated won the Best Blockchain Game award at the Crypto Games Conference in 2019, and more awards in recent years. It’s trailer was featured on the IGN YouTube channel, which is one of the most influential in the gaming sector. Within a few days, it had racked up over 80,000 views on the IGN channel and over 85,000 on the main Fracture Labs channel, bringing its total view count to over 165,000 views  With this latest funding round, even more development can be made to the game, with the Fracture Labs team revealing that it will be leveraging UnrealEngine 5 for this. This comes just after Decimated received the EpicMegaGrant from Unreal Engine to further its efforts.  On the team end, Fracture Labs announced an expansion, with its team growing to over 47 members. This team is at the helm of the Decimated community, which is over 140,000 followers strong and more than 20,000 in their discord community.  DIO, the native token of the Decimated universe, has also seen significant progress recently. It is already listed on several exchanges such as Raydium, Gate.io or Huobi but has even more listings on the way. The DIO staking pool went live on 27th July 2022 following the claim portal launch. This portal is the vesting portal specifically created for Vlaunch winners and investors and is where they can manually claim their DIO tokens.  The NFT Marketplace is due to launch in the run-up to the game launch, which will include in-game vehicles, weapons, apartments, and shops that players can leverage within the game. In the future, Decimated will be opening as a platform for user-generated content, giving content creators and modders the ability to sell their own vehicles, weapons, apartment and character customizations as NFTs.  Conclusions  If you are interested and want to jump in early, you can:  * Buy DIO on Raydium, Gate.io, Huobi or Coinmarketcap exchanges  * Join their engaged discord community.  * Start following the content on their social media.  * Wait for the official launch.

Marketed as a Dogecoin killer, Shiba Inu (SHIB) was created by an anonymous cryptocurrency developer in August 2020. SHIB has continued to grow in these 2 years, eliciting positive responses from industry giants such as Elon Musk and Vitalik Buterin.  Big thanks to the Shiba Inu community, whose cryptocurrency made these fellowships possible!  — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin)   Since its launch, the altcoin has maintained a rivalry with DOGE, even though the latter continues to grab a larger share of the market.  The burgeoning cryptocurrency market proved to be pleasant for SHIB also. The Shiba Inu community’s demand to get the coin listed on Robinhood Markets Inc. had it hitting an ATH of $0.00008845 in late-October 2021.  The second quarter of 2022 proved to be a bloodbath, however, with SHIB suffering. At press time, it was valued at 0.00001198.  Why these projections matter  As is evident, a sense of community is crucial to the growth of SHIB. Whether it is their demand to get it listed on Robinhood or asking McDonald’s to accept it as a mode of payment, the community has always rallied around the growth of SHIB.  I’m getting a Shiba Inu   — Elon Musk (@elonmusk)   It has also become a home to a huge community of NFT artists who focus on the Shiba Inu breed of dogs in their artworks.  “Rather than simply dismissing the hype outright, it’s important to realize that what we’re seeing is the mass movement of traders new to crypto moving into the space,”  Ben Caselin, Head of Research and Strategy at AAX. He added, “SHIB coin is a meme coin and embraces that.”  As it runs on an Ethereum platform, it currently employs the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism and will transition to the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. The upcoming Ethereum 2.0 transition will also certainly impact the growth of the currency.  In this article, we will give an overview of the key performance indicators of SHIB such as price and market cap. We will then share with you what most popular crypto-analysts have to say about the future of this meme coin. This information will be complemented by data charts for a better understanding of the trajectory of SHIB so far and later.  Shiba Inu’s Price, Market Cap and everything in between  During the crypto-bloom of 2021, SHIB’s price continued to soar and hit 0.00003503 in mid-May. Its price further rose by over 34% when it got  on the crypto-exchange Coinbase in September 2021.  When the Shiba Inu community clamoured to get the cryptocurrency listed on Robinhood Markets Inc., its price  to an ATH of $0.00008845 in late October 2021. The altcoin, however, was not listed on the exchange before April 2022. At that point of time, it even dislodged Dogecoin to become the most-valued meme coin by market capitalization. The surge also led to its mass adoption by many cryptocurrency enthusiasts.  As the cryptocurrency market crashed during Q2 of 2022, SHIB’s  also continued to fall. From its April 2022 price of 0.000026, it fell to a little below $0.000008 by mid-June 2022. Since then, it has slowly risen, trading at 0.00001249 at press time.    Source: SHIB/USD, TradingView  The market capitalization of SHIB broadly reflected its price throughout the course of its history. During the crypto-run of 2021, its market cap peaked at $41 billion by the end of October 2021. At no point of time in 2021 was SHIB’s market cap below $16.5 billion.  During the Q2 2022 crash, its market cap fell even below $4.5 billion in mid-June. Currently, its market cap is a little above $6.5 billion, making it the 15th largest cryptocurrency.  Along with DOGE, SHIB has been responsible for a flood of meme-coins in the cryptocurrency market such as Bit Shiba, King Shiba and Baby Doge.  Shiba Inu Coin’s 2025 Predictions  Before reading further, we must understand that market predictions of different analysts widely vary. A good number of times, these predictions will prove to be wrong as analysts cannot always foresee events such as political or environmental crises. It is wise that an investor conducts their own research before investing in a cryptocurrency, especially in something as volatile as SHIB.  For instance, a Changelly blogpost claimed that after studying SHIB prices and market fluctuations, experts predict that SHIB could go as high as $0.00005048 and as low as $0.00004183. Its potential ROI for the said year is predicted to be 322%, with its average price remaining $0.00004335.  Telegaon concurred,  that according to some crypto-experts, Shiba Inu Coin’s price can hit a new ATH in 2025. On the contrary, even though they expect enough tokens being burnt this year, they are not so hopeful about its price rise in 2022. They predict the maximum and minimum prices of SHIB to be $0.0001928 and $0.00009839, respectively. Its average price was predicted to be around $0.0001152.  Shiba Inu Coin’s 2030 Predictions  The aforementioned Changelly blogpost also mentioned that in 2030, SHIB will be traded at an average price of $0.00030921. Its maximum and minimum prices will be $0.00035649 and $0.00029857, respectively. The potential ROI for SHIB in 2030 is predicted to be 2,878%.  Now, there’s good reason to believe why SHIB’s price might hike on the charts. For instance, according to many, if users burn enough tokens, a cryptocurrency’s acceptance is bound to increase. That being said, the meme coin must cultivate a host of different use cases too.  And, not everyone agrees with whatever utility meme-coins like DOGE and SHIB might have either. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse, for instance,  that this asset class isn’t good for the market at large. In fact, it has often been speculated that these assets are part of a bubble.  Back in April, Finder  a panel of 26 experts who predicted a rather gloomy picture for the future of Shiba Inu coin. They predicted that the average price of SHIB in 2030 will be as low as $0.000000325.  Speaking for a majority of the panelists, Dimitrios Salampasis claimed,  “I am of the opinion that all these joke-type coins will disappear and leave space for actual innovation and crypto-assets that can serve proper use cases.”    Source: Finder  Conclusion  Shiba Inu Coin has continued to grow, hand in hand with the token burns. However, as its supply decreases and demand increases, its price should rise. Ideally. In fact, many investors have become millionaires by investing in this meme coin.  This July, Shiba Inu developer Shytoshi Kusama wrote in a  that progress on Shibarium, the platform’s Layer 2 protocol, is on track. The update will allow users to move assets with minor gas fees, empowering micro transactions over Shiba Inu-based dApps. SHI, a stable coin, is also expected to be released this year. A new token, TREAT, is also upcoming. It will be used as a reward token on Shiba Inu-based metaverse and games.  As we can see, there is a lot of anticipation associated with the innovations brought forward by Shiba Inu Coin. Even so, there is a lot of uncertainty regarding its future. Investors should therefore conduct their own research before investing in the currency. Worth pointing out, however, that there is a lot of greed going around right now, with the F&G index flashing a reading of 65 at press time.

"147",1220,2022-08-13,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Logan Chipkin, a freelance writer interested in Bitcoin, economics, physics, philosophy and history.  Money doesn’t make the world go ‘round. Ideas do.  In “ ,” economist Dr. Saifedean Ammous explains how our devolution from a hard money standard to a fiat standard has caused distortions in virtually all of the modern world’s fundamental sectors: education, nutrition, energy, science and medicine, to name a few.  As Ammous writes:  “…[Fiat] severs the connection between work and reward. Rather than the market offering individuals reward for their work as valued by the others they serve, fiat money makes monetary reward highly dependent on political obedience and connections. Instead of learning to be productive, fiat teaches you to play politics. Instead of work being rewarded based on its productivity, it is rewarded based on artificial status games.”  But fiat is more harmful to progress than Ammous’ devastating explanation suggests. What people choose to do, what problems they choose to tackle and what solutions they aim to create, are predicated on their ideas.  Some ideas evolve by surviving criticism: in science, these are theories that pass rigorous testing and debate. In the market, these are the ideas behind products that yield a profit. In culture, they are behavioral patterns that survive moral, aesthetic and political criticism. Following physicist , we may call ideas that spread by surviving criticism rational memes.  For civilization to make progress, we typically need to create as much wealth as possible, as quickly as possible. To solve world hunger, we need the wealth required to build out mass food production systems. To become an interplanetary species, we need the wealth required to build out cost effective transportation systems as well as the technology required to survive and thrive on other planets. And so on.  The more our culture is dominated by rational memes, the better able we are to create wealth. The more we are able to throw away ideas that fail to survive criticism, the more our actions will be predicated on ideas that are in concert with reality.  Unfortunately, some ideas spread by suppressing criticism, rather than by surviving it. And this is where a fiat standard rears its ugliest head.  Consider how diversity, equity and inclusion mandates (DEI) spread. Advocates of DEI intimidate dissidents into silence, all too ready to demonize its opponents as “racist” and “sexist.” Across universities, corporate America and media, fear of ostracism and slander has a chilling effect on those who disagree with DEI prescriptions. Thus, DEI rarely has to answer for itself. Rather, it rampages forward, neutralizing all would-be criticism in its path.  Market feedback is a form of criticism, too. On a hard money standard, DEI-driven companies and universities would compete with meritocracy-driven alternatives. Market competition has a way of ruthlessly culling waste and mistakes. Expending capital on quasi-religious sessions and hiring practices that satisfy diversity quotas are costly mistakes. On a hard money standard, such companies would quickly lose out to companies whose only agenda was to produce what consumers most want at the lowest possible price.  But we don’t live in a world of hard money. The fiat standard allows for DEI, a collection of ideas that does not help companies provide better products, to thrive. In a fiat currency regime, governments and their central banks can create money out of thin air to subsidize companies, universities and nonprofits with DEI mandates. Thus, the inherent advantage of institutions that are not ideologically captured is lost. Neither open discussion nor market feedback are as effective in extinguishing DEI as they would be under a hard monetary regime.  Environmental, social and governance (ESG) mandates follow a similar logic to their DEI parallel. Organizations that conform to ESG mandates must satisfy a list of criteria that are often antithetical to their ability to appease the market. They expend precious time and resources ensuring that they are sufficiently environmentally friendly and boast a workforce that is diverse in some meaningless sense. Dissenters of the ESG movement are not engaged with, but rather slandered as “climate deniers” or “selfish.”  Governments and international organizations like the International Monetary Fund will often only fund projects that conform to ESG mandates. Thus, companies will abide by these costly constraints in order to gain access to the fiat faucet.  Absent this criminally easy fiat money, ESG-conforming companies would be forced to compete with companies whose only drive is to best satisfy the market. Consumer choice would serve as criticism of ESG, which in turn would wither away in the presence of leaner, more efficient competitors.  DEI and ESG are examples of what Deutsch calls anti-rational memes: ideas that spread by inhibiting criticism. Unlike rational memes, anti-rational memes make it more difficult to create wealth, since they thwart the emergence and propagation of novel ideas.  It’s important for Bitcoiners (and hard money advocates more generally) to concede that there are no guarantees. Anti-rational memes like DEI and ESG may survive as we evolve towards a Bitcoin standard. However, without access to fiat money, they will be far less able to suppress criticism (either rhetorical arguments or market feedback). In general:  A fiat standard lowers the cost of spreading anti-rational memes and lowers the returns on spreading rational memes, and;  A hard money (Bitcoin) standard raises the cost of spreading anti-rational memes and raises the returns on spreading rational memes.  Ammous is correct that a fiat regime drives institutions to appease politicians rather than solve the problems they were originally designed to solve. But, as I hinted at earlier, the deleterious effects of a fiat regime are deeper than that: they give anti-rational memes a shot in the arm, of which Ammous’ examples are but a subset.  To be sure, there are other error-corrective mechanisms in society, which is why we’ve been able to make progress despite fiat’s tentacles slithering into ever further corners of civilization. Moreover, the cost of spreading anti-rational memes hasn’t fallen to zero ever since fiat replaced gold. Rather, the cost has fallen relative to what it would be under a hard money standard. The inverse is true for rational memes: their returns haven’t fallen to zero, but rather are lower than they would be under an honest monetary regime.  Bitcoiners are right when they say that Bitcoin will lower our collective time preference, make for a more honest culture and fortify property rights. But a more fundamental consequence of hyperbitcoinization is the subsequent change in the processes by which ideas spread. Fiat makes the suppression of criticism cheap, and therefore stunts progress. A hard money standard aligns the best ideas in society with the greatest opportunities for profit (either monetary or psychic).  A Bitcoin world is one in which the arena of ideas is once again egalitarian, where an idea cannot survive by relying on subsidies and intimidation tactics, but only on merit. Anti-rational memes will suffer, rational memes will thrive, and we will experience the most  that history has ever seen.  This is a guest post by Logan Chipkin.

"148",479,2022-08-12,"CryptoDaily","The investment management company has launched a private trust, which will be its first product offering direct Bitcoin exposure.  Private Trust For Institutional Investors  The private trust launched by BlackRock will provide institutional clients based in the United States with direct exposure to spot Bitcoin. The trust will track the performance of Bitcoin while lowering the expenses and liabilities. The decision to embark upon this project was taken due to the residual interest from certain clients. The company announced the launch of the trust through a public statement on its website, where it wrote,  “Despite the steep downturn in the digital asset market, we are still seeing substantial interest from some institutional clients in how to efficiently and cost-effectively access these assets using our technology and product capabilities.”  Being the largest, oldest, and most liquid crypto, Bitcoin has captured the attention of BlackRock’s client base, who are keen to dabble in this asset through an investment management firm.  BlackRock’s Web3 Moves  Many communities and groups have raised concerns about the energy-intensive process of Bitcoin mining and its environmental impact. Although BlackRock is not involved in any way with the mining operations, the team has mentioned that it would be doing its part in supporting initiatives to introduce sustainable energy usage in Bitcoin mining. The company’s Web3 initiatives have been distributed among four areas of interest: permissioned blockchains, stablecoins, cryptoassets, and tokenization. The spot Bitcoin private trust is its initiative in the cryptoassets category.  Partnership With Coinbase  Earlier this year, BlackRock CEO Larry Find had indicated that the company might start dabbling in crypto trading. The company’s other noteworthy web3 endeavor was its recent partnership with crypto exchange Coinbase to offer cryptocurrencies to institutional investors. The partnership will enable BlackRock’s institutional investment management platform Aladdin to provide its clients with crypto trading functionalities and all associated capabilities. To access these services, institutions must sign up for Coinbase Prime, a trading solution service tailormade for hedge funds, asset collectors, financial institutions, and corporate treasuries.  Institutional Investors Want More Crypto Action  With roughly $9 trillion in assets under management for institutional clients, including central banks, BlackRock is the biggest asset fund manager in the world. According to a market leader and expert, Barry Silbert, the recent Bitcoin private trust from BlackRock will provide a simpler and safer channel for central banks around the globe to invest in the crypto. Institutional investors are increasingly warming up toward digital assets despite an overwhelming bear market. With individual investors pulling out of the market, there is ample space for institutional investors to set up shop through the safe exposure promised by BlackRock’s private trust.

"149",563,2022-08-11,"Cryptonews.com","The  face-off does not need to be a fight to the death, a new report has suggested – and a more nuanced approach could pay off for crypto players now fretting about which side of the fence they should be on.  The claims were made in a  on PoW and PoS from the crypto exchange  ’s Kraken Intelligence unit, which noted that both types of blockchain consensus mechanisms come with considerable benefits and drawbacks.  PoW is now used by , while  plans to  this September.  The report’s authors noted that PoW and PoS are the crypto world’s two biggest Sybil resistance mechanisms. This means they protect blockchain networks against potential Sybil attacks like spam nodes and  – as well as regulating the selection of block validators.  And the authors pointed out the importance of networks exhibiting Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT).  This latter concept comes from game theory, referring to the fact that decentralized parties can often struggle to achieve consensus without the help of a mutually trusted central party. It refers to a situation whereby a group of Byzantine-era generals must conduct a joint attack on an enemy position from a number of separate positions – but cannot directly communicate with each other during the process.  This theoretical problem for the Byzantine generals, the authors remarked, “highlights a common problem among distributed networks” – namely, “Can [the] independent participants of a distributed network form an agreement?”  BFT in PoS and PoW each involve “trade-offs” – and the “rivalry” between the two consensus mechanisms “confronts key questions of network security, sustainability, barriers to entry, and decentralization,” the Kraken Intelligence unit remarked.  The authors opined that PoW “generally offers better security and decentralization guarantees,” albeit at the cost of “scalability.”  “Conversely, PoS typically offers better scalability in exchange for security and decentralization,” they wrote.  As such, the unit’s reply to the great crypto question of our time – Is PoW or PoS better? – is “it depends.” The “best choice” of mechanism “ultimately depends on a given blockchain’s use case,” the authors remarked.  PoW helps blockchains “retain the ethos of cryptoassets,” namely decentralization and security, they said.  But for “use cases such as hard money,” they wrote, PoS is “likely less desirable” as these mechanisms allow for the “possibility of the wealthiest users gaining an overwhelming share” – which would compromise factors like decentralization.  However, when it comes to “mediums of exchange” and smart contracts, the authors opined that PoW is “potentially less desirable,” because network efficiency and scalability are “paramount if these types of blockchains are to resist long-term scaling issues.”  In essence, the authors painted a picture of a sliding scale with scalability at one end and decentralization at the other – and a consensus mechanism to match at each end. They explained:  “A highly scalable network is said to optimize scalability at the expense of decentralization and network security.”  The authors concluded that the choice between PoW and PoS was “not black and white” for blockchain networks.  Instead, they urged anyone thinking of using a blockchain network to develop a “nuanced understanding of the two and their trade-offs” to determine which option was “better suited” to their needs.  _____"
"150",656,2022-08-11,"CryptoDaily","In recent decades, discourse around the environment has become more significant and everpresent. People are rightfully worried about how our technologies affect our global ecosystem. With the recent heatwaves and fires that spread around Europe this summer, the topic of climate change has been on everybody's lips.  Blockchain tech is often a primary antagonist when the environment is discussed. Bitcoin is regularly cited as being deeply energy hungry and detrimental to the preservation of our world. However, several projects in this industry have the opposite effect, directly helping the environment. Let’s delve into three crucial blockchain projects that are making an effort to bring positive environmental change.  Megatech  Megatech is a project that promotes and incentivizes the use of solar power within Africa. To do this, Megatech has launched a cryptocurrency that gives token holders returns on the solar fields that the company owns. When these solar fields are used, token holders earn more money, incentivizing people to fund and promote sustainable energy sources.  Megatech is already in motion to set up one of its solar fields (named Project Beta) in Hertzogville Free state, South Africa. It is a 60-megawatt plant connected to a 100-megawatt per hour (MWh) state-of-the-art storage technology unit. This allows for maximum efficiency and, therefore, maximum sustainability.  The idea behind Megatech is to help solve the energy supply crisis in South Africa, where there is not enough electricity within the country to sufficiently power its national grid, causing blackouts and shortages. However, Megatech is also looking to help the global effort to bring sustainable energy, as they have teamed up with ZPN Energy, a UK energy and storage provider.  Nori  Nori is a blockchain-based carbon removal company aimed at helping people and organizations reduce or neutralize their carbon footprint. To do this, Nori has created a carbon removal marketplace– this is where people can choose to offset or eliminate their carbon footprint by paying other companies to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Currently, the marketplace focuses on allowing people to fund agriculture projects that store carbon within the soil.  When somebody pays for carbon removal on the marketplace, their transaction is logged to the blockchain. They are subsequently given a verifiable certificate proving they have made a positive environmental change. This is especially important as the carbon credit, and removal industry is rife with fraudulent behavior, pushing companies to use traceable and publicly visible records to prevent this.  Rewilder  Rewilder is a crypto-based non-profit focused on purchasing land for wildlife conservation. The project asks users to donate Ethereum, which goes directly towards purchasing and preserving land worldwide. After donating, each user is issued a special NFT that provides regular updates on how their money has been used and what environmental impact they have instigated.  Like Nori, Rewilder is mindful of the need for transparency regarding environmental procedures. Therefore, everything that happens within this project can be tracked and traced via the Ethereum blockchain. People can even find the specific location of the land they helped to conserve via their NFTs.  Shifting Perspectives  These three projects actively change the discourse around blockchain tech and the environment. They are moving the needle away from the damaging practices that projects like Bitcoin have been shown to employ and towards more eco-conscious efforts. And by doing this, they are changing people's opinions of blockchain tech and proving that this industry can act as a bastion of hope for the world.  The crypto and blockchain industry is becoming a champion of the environment, with Megatech and other projects leading the charge to transform the world back to a state of ecological and climate harmony.

"152",588,2022-08-11,"Blockchain.News","CleanSpark, Inc., a US Bitcoin mining company based in Nevada, announced on Tuesday that it is expanding its crypto mining business to take advantage of opportunities that emerge in the ongoing bear market.  CleanSpark disclosed that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Waha Technologies, a low-carbon Bitcoin miner, to acquire a Bitcoin mining site (owned by Waha), which includes the mining facility and machines.  CleanSpark acquired an active Bitcoin mining facility located in Washington, Georgia, for $16.2 million. The firm also bought around 3,400 of the latest generation Antminer S19 series of machines for approximately $8.9 million from Waha Technologies.  Such machines, already operating at the acquired site, will add over 340 petahashes per second (PH/s) of computing power, CleanSpark said.  The firm said it will fill the balance of the 36 MW with machines already paid for and on hand. The site has exclusive rights to an additional 50 MW of power, making the site scalable to 86 MW.  CleanSpark seized on current market conditions to acquire the site. The firm stated that most of the acquired machines are the Antminer S19 or S19J Pro models, among the most power-efficient Bitcoin mining machines on the market.  CleanSpark expects to close on the transaction within the next 30 days, subject to customary closing conditions.  Zach Bradford, CleanSpark's CEO, further talked about the development: We are excited to expand our footprint in Georgia. The market has been preparing all summer for consolidation, and we are pleased to be on the acquiring side.

Surviving the Bearish Market  Cryptocurrency mining firms have a lot of fixed costs, such as power, real estate, and rigs that do the actual mining.  That is the reason why it can be hell for their margins when the market significantly drops the value of funds they were holding in crypto like Bitcoin. As now the market seems to be in a prolonged bear market, mining companies are being forced to adjust.  In June, many publicly listed Bitcoin mining firms collectively sold more Bitcoin than they mined in May as the value of Bitcoin tumbled 45%.  For instance, in June, Bitfarms  for around $62 million and used the proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt.  Early last month, Core Scientific announced that it  in June, as inflation and market turbulence piled pressure on public crypto companies. The SDAQ-listed company sold 7,202 Bitcoins mined during June in order to enhance liquidity.  Last month, CleanSpark at a steep discount as it continues expanding its infrastructure.  As markets have slumped, firms have gone to great lengths to adjust their businesses; some are buying mining rigs, while others are pausing the construction of their mining sites, and others are expanding their projects."
"153",1267,2022-08-11,"Bitcoin Magazine","Daniel Batten is a climate tech investor, author, analyst and environmental campaigner who previously founded and led his own tech company.  Why A Climate Tech Investor Got Excited About Gases From Garbage  Since 2013, climate technology has grown at a similarly astounding pace to bitcoin itself: up , and . In fact, climate tech now represents .  Now, the two worlds are merging as Bitcoin mining emerges not only as the way that the world’s future financial system is secured, but also as one of the world’s most important climate tech propositions. In terms of its ability to tackle our most urgent emission problems at scale today, it is, incredibly, the best-positioned climate tech solution.  A bit of background: climate tech is the fastest growing area of venture capital for a reason. In the technology sector, you get commercially rewarded for solving the biggest pain points. The prevalence of climate tech suggests that collectively, humanity may have finally woken up to the fact our real issues are not a lack of retina display devices, but a lack of a clear path to a safe climate.  Climate tech companies are a little like Maslow’s hierarchy of needs: some are focused on the most urgent, pressing issues (akin to “Food, Water and Shelter”) on Maslow’s hierarchy. Others are more about the nuances higher up the pyramid.  When I explain Maslow’s hierarchy to people, I often say “If you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, self-actualisation is unlikely to be your top priority.”  About a year ago, I realized that unless we have our “survival-tech” sorted, the higher layers of climate tech will arrive too late to help us.  Based on the fact that a technology ready today has a more immediate impact than one ready in a decade, and the fact that , we can get a sense of what Maslow’s pyramid looks like for climate tech.  Layer 4 climate tech: local emission impact; a project to tidy up local rivers.  Layer 3 climate tech: able to decrease carbon emissions at scale globally.  Layer 2 climate tech: able to decrease methane emissions at scale globally.  Layer 1 climate tech: technologies that decrease methane emissions at scale globally and are ready today.  Most investors can’t be relied on to invest in the most important areas of climate tech.  For example, The PwC State of ClimateTech report 2021 found that of the 15 technology areas analyzed, the top five that represent over 80% of future emissions reduction potential by 2050received just 25% of recent climate tech investment.  That report itself made no mention of methane, though since the UNEP’s statement that “ ,” I’d be surprised if it isn’t a new focus area in 2022.  So to put things simply: For us to counter climate change we must work on all four layers simultaneously.  Examples of Layer 3 companies include two very promising companies we invested in recently: Hot Lime Labs, who are decarbonizing the world’s greenhouses, and Zincovery who are decarbonizing the world’s zinc recycling process.  Examples of Layer 2 companies include BlueMethane who have a promising technology that could one day remove 1 billion tonnes of methane from the world’s hydroelectric dams, rice paddies and wastewater. Another example is Cetogenix, who can improve the efficiency with which methane is extracted.  All four of these examples can make a significant global impact on emissions. Equally, all four will require a few more years to achieve the scale necessary to realize that potential impact.  Just like Maslow’s hierarchy — unless we can use technologies that are ready today to decrease methane emissions at scale globally: the sobering reality is that these other promising technologies will be ready too late, because we’ll have already tipped beyond 1.5°C of global warming.  About a year ago I realized that all the projects we invested in were Layer 3 technologies. We weren’t doing anything to reduce methane emissions, which was a more immediate issue. Secondly, we weren’t doing anything to invest in technologies that were ready to work at scale today.  The more I researched methane emissions, the more I realized we don’t have time to wait for technologies that are ready to scale in eight years. We must also get moving on technologies that are ready today; these are our Layer 1 projects, or what I call “survival-tech.”  Our biggest methane emitters are animal agriculture, oil and gas reserves, and landfills. I believe that the best way to reduce animal agriculture involves behavioral change in our eating habits — less meat and dairy in our diets. No fancy technology needed there. The other two cannot be tackled by behavioral change however. Landfills created in the 1970s for example are  methane today, and will continue for years to come irrespective of our current behaviors.  Of the 300+ climate tech ideas I’ve seen in the last decade, the best Layer 1 climate tech I’ve seen is also the most low-tech: Capturing methane and using it to generate electricity, then using that electricity for location-agnostic customers that don’t require expensive gas pipelines or pylons to deliver that power to their doorstep. For the majority of these landfills, the only such location-agnostic customer that made economic sense was Bitcoin mining.  It’s a very simple, crude and devastatingly effective way to solve our most urgent emission issues.  The added advantage that landfills have is that you don’t suffer the distraction of people criticizing you for working with oil and gas companies. All the profits go to municipalities, the community. So it ticks the environmental and social boxes right away.  The uninformed will still retort that “we should be using that methane to power something more useful,” a statement that conveys both “I haven’t considered how useful Bitcoin is to the two-thirds of people living under autocratic or semi-autocratic regimes without solid financial systems,” and “I haven’t looked into the viability of alternative uses of that energy” at the same time.  The reality is that unless your landfill is in a very large urban center, there is no economical way to use the gas produced: Gas pipelines  ~$5 million per mile to build, and creating a power station only makes sense at scale. For three-quarters of the world’s landfills, the unique location-agnostic feature of Bitcoin mobile-mining units provides a solution to two-thirds of our world’s most urgent Layer 1 problem (emissions from landfills and oil fields).  It can scale fast, and it turns a liability — the cost of inserting and maintaining flare stacks — into an asset for the municipal landfill, and therefore the whole community.  Currently Vespene is leading the charge. Because of the times we live in, it is no exaggeration to say that this makes them one of the most important Layer 1 climate tech companies in the world, and therefore one of the world’s most important companies of our time.

"154",330,2022-08-10,"Bitcoin Magazine","* Motiv Inc., has announced the launch of 16 circular bitcoin economies in Peru.  * The company develops educational resources teaching underdeveloped communities how to use bitcoin to create their own economies.  * Many communities in Peru are separated from central banking but the region has 80% smartphone penetration, making room for bitcoin adoption.  Motiv Inc., a non-governmental organization (NGO) dedicated to creating bitcoin circular economies, has launched a new series of programs in Peru to educate and equip 16 communities with the tools needed to create their own economy, per a press release sent to Bitcoin Magazine.  With these programs, the team at Motiv seeks to provide “opportunity, not charity” to many Peruvian communities who find it hard or impossible to interact with legacy financial institutions.  “Unlike many groups that just donate money to those in need, Motiv recognizes that handing out cash may be at best a short-term solution but lacks the education and skills training for longer sustainability,” says Richard Swisher, CEO and co-founder of Motiv.  Sadly, many Peruvians find themselves virtually excluded from the global economy due to an absence of centralized banking and financial education in remote regions. Motiv seeks to remedy this financial exclusion through providing educational resources enabling communities to create their own circular economy with bitcoin encouraging growth and stability in the region.  “As bitcoin gains a toehold in impoverished communities, we are pleased to see the increase of adoption and excitement emerge from its citizens as new businesses are formed using bitcoin, and more people become engaged with the currency by using it in their daily lives,” Swisher continued.  Motiv is based in the U.S. with operations in Peru and was founded in July 2020. The NGO seeks to improve the lives of those less fortunate after the two co-founders encountered a village in the Peruvian Andes Mountains left to fend for themselves, excluded from the rest of the world."
"155",836,2022-08-09,"Cryptonews.com","The  from the United States Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to effectively ban the  -powered crypto mixing service Tornado Cash has polarized the crypto community.  Some think it is a sign that more sweeping regulatory measures could be on their way – while others have suggested that the OFAC’s decision to add Tornado Cash to its Specially Designated Nationals list may turn out to be a positive step.  Here are some of the arguments from both sides.  United we stand...  Many crypto users appear to have been spooked by the OFAC’s move and are fearful of the consequences. While the community appears to agree that bad actors seek to use services like Tornado Cash to launder funds, some argue that privacy-providing apps are important.   entrepreneur Ragnar Lifthrasir took to Twitter to  that “many people outside of bitcoin” do “care about privacy and have built good privacy tools” – and suggested that BTC enthusiasts sit up and take note.  He wrote:  “One failure of [bitcoin] maximalism is that by attacking anyone or any project that’s not bitcoin, they’re attacking privacy developers and tools.”  “Privacy,” Lifthrasir concluded, “requires allies.”  Another bitcoiner, Muneeb Ali, the co-founder of the open-source BTC smart contract platform Stacks, concurred. Ali  that it was time to “put our crypto tribalism aside” as “the Crypto Wars II are starting.” He claimed that the Specially Designated Nationals list was a “sanctions list” that was “meant for people, not tech tools.”  Ali wrote:  “Privacy tools are for every American.”  Indeed, the ETH advocate and software engineer Adriano Feria  a stark warning for bitcoiners, writing:  “Let me remind you [that] they are conspiring against BTC as well, and they will [attack] mining with [Environmental, Social, and Governance] narratives, and it will not end there.”  Feria was responding to comments elsewhere on Twitter that suggested that Ethereum’s move to a proof-of-stake (  ) protocol could safeguard it from those who attempt to attack crypto mining on environmental grounds.   CNBC, Tom Robinson, the Chief Scientist at the blockchain analytics provider Elliptic was quoted as stating:  “There is a need for solutions that can help you cover your tracks, even when you’re not doing anything illicit.”  The Founder of the ShapeShift crypto exchange Erik Voorhees turned up the irony,  sardonically:  “I’m sure the bad guys will stop using Tornado Cash because it's ‘illegal’ Just like they don’t use illegal weapons, smuggle illegal drugs, or illegally launder money through every means they can find. Law-abiding Americans are the only ones hurt by this.”  There were even offers of support from some.  The Tornado developer Roman Semenov wrote on Twitter that his GitHub account had been “suspended,”  :  “Is writing an open source code illegal now?”  But the operator of the secure mobile bitcoin wallet provider Samourai Wallet Twitter account responded by  to let Semenov use the wallet’s “self-hosted GitLab to host your code if you want.”  Meanwhile, at 9:46 UTC, tornado cash (TORN) was trading at USD 22, down 28% in a day and 13% in a week. Overall, it fell 8% in a month, 63% in a year, and 95% from its February 2021 all-time high.  ...divided we fall  Not everyone will be sad to see the back of Tornado, it seems.  Mark Jeffrey, the author of the Max Quick series of books, claimed that Tornado had had a “house dropped on it,” and that while he is “generally libertarian and pro-privacy,” the mixer “is primarily used for bad things.”  He  :  “Post exploit, it’s usually Tornado and gone. So, I’m a bit conflicted, but I have to support this.”  Ryan Selkis, the Founder of Messari, , writing that he “would like to not live in a dystopian hellscape where privacy is illegal by default,” but explained:  “Also, I would like to not live in a world where North Korea can effectively seize 10% of M1 through bridge hacks.”  ____  Peter Van Valkenburgh, of Coin Center, on the OFAC Tornado cash SDN listing  The times they are a-changin'  No matter which side of the fence you sit on when it comes to crypto mixers, most agree that the OFAC’s move will likely turn out to be a watershed moment in regulation.  Jake Chervinsky, the Head of Policy at the Blockchain Association,  :  “For years, the Treasury has carefully distinguished bad actors from the neutral tools and technology that they (plus everyone else in the world) are able to use. The decision to sanction TornadoCash, a decentralized protocol, threatens that smart and balanced approach to crypto.”  And the ban’s effects are already being felt.

Now, with the transition looming in the near future, many major players have planned their next moves.  What’s your take?

Guo  last week and announced that he would fork the Ethereum blockchain to “ETH POW.”  To support this, the not-yet-born Ethereum PoW version even has a website called .  Now, the aforementioned initiative gained traction as it got support from renowned crypto-exchanges. Starting with Huobi, the team in an 8 August blog post   “As long as the ETH forked assets meet our security requirements, we will take the first move to support users to hold the assets and earn rewards. Trading services for those coins will be available as soon as possible per our rules.”   would distribute forked assets (including, but not limited to ETH) if the platform’s requirements are met.

Meanwhile, MEXC, another crypto-service provider, announced its support in a . The team added,  “To mitigate the risks caused by market volatility during the hard fork and safeguard users’ assets, MEXC will list two potential forked ETH tokens and the associated markets.”  Indeed, these listings would create a division amongst ETH loyalists who might have to choose between the two related networks.  Calling out the newbie  Starting right with the leader , crypto-journalist Colin Wu re-shared his narrative in a 7 August tweet.  Cryptoslate: Vitalik Buterin called people pushing for a hard fork of Ethereum to retain POW “own exchanges and are just trying to make a quick buck”, “I foresee market confusion if that proof-of-work hard fork becomes something substantial”.   — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain)   Meanwhile, the  protocol took a similar approach as well. In an official , Chainlink revealed its services would remain on the Ethereum blockchain, post the long-awaited Merge.  In addition to this,Bitmex Research published a  called “ETHPoW vs ETH2.” It examined a hypothetical debate over the two potential Ethereum networks, even highlighting the technical challenges that ETHPoW could face soon."
"158",531,2022-08-08,"Cryptonews.com","Another hard fork won't ""significantly"" harm  and ""pretty much everyone"" in the Ethereum ecosystem is supportive of The Merge, when the network transitions from a proof-of-work (  ) system to proof-of-stake (  ), according to Ethereum co-founder .  His remarks come after some crypto miners, including prominent Chinese miner Chandler Guo, have expressed intentions to fork Ethereum as it moves to PoS, making miners obsolete.  “I don’t expect Ethereum to really be significantly harmed by another fork,” Buterin said in a webinar this past weekend,  Fortune.  “My impression from pretty much everyone I talked to in the Ethereum ecosystem is that they’ve been completely supportive of the proof-of-stake effort and united around it,” he was quoted as saying.  For now, the much-anticipated Merge upgrade is expected to go through as soon as September. Ethereum supporters are excited about the upgrade, which should improve the network's efficiency and reduce its environmental impact.  However, Ethereum miners, whose earnings are at stake following the upgrade given that it would remove the need for miners to secure the network, are not seemingly happy. To keep their income, they are advertising for a potential continued “ETH PoW” (“Ethereum proof-of-work”) chain post-upgrade.  The Ethereum mastermind claimed that those pushing for a fork are mostly “a couple of outsiders that basically have exchanges and most just want to make a quick buck.”  “So, I’m not expecting it to have substantial long-term adoption, just because I think  already has a superior community and superior product for people pro-proof-of-work,” noting that still there might be “a couple of splats” as Ethereum shifts.  Buterin was also quoted as saying that if a PoW fork turns out to be a success, a lot of decentralized applications would have ""to choose one way or the other,” which could cause a lot of market confusion and problems: “I hope that whatever happens doesn’t lead to people losing money.”  While there might be different attempts to fork the Ethereum blockchain, one that has already found some traction is called EthereumPOW. Spearheaded by Guo, the attempt reportedly has the support of several Chinese companies manufacturing Ethereum mining equipment.

"159",603,2022-08-05,"CryptoDaily","When cryptocurrency entered the market some 14 years ago, many thought it was purely speculative, expecting its time under the limelight to be short-lived. However, as we have seen in the previous decade, crypto has revolutionized currencies and the concept of value exchange.  Nonetheless, concerns regarding volatility remain. Understandably, a portion of the public is weary of putting their money in cryptocurrencies that are entirely intangible and have no inherent value. This is the reason for the emergence of stablecoins and various digital currencies that are pegged to physical assets.  Now, a newcomer to the crypto space called Uniglo (GLO) hopes to bridge any remaining gaps by developing a multi-asset-backed treasury to support its native token.  Uniglo (GLO)  Uniglo is a new decentralized finance (DeFi) project that will grow a treasury supported by a wide range of assets. Half of the transaction taxes in the platform will go into a treasury that will be used to purchase digital currencies and digitized real-world collectibles. As such, the Uniglo investment portfolio would be highly diversified, providing sustainable backing for its GLO token.  Many people consider cryptocurrencies to be worthless because they are completely intangible and have no connection to valuable things in the real world. But with Uniglo, people who are cautious of the risks in crypto are provided with a middle ground that could usher them into the DeFi space.  With a sound structure for underpinning the value of its currency, Uniglo could provide an example of how the value of non-pegged digital coins could be assessed.  Bitcoin (BTC)  A key question we must ask now is whether Bitcoin could back its currency in the same way as Uniglo. That could prove difficult, as Bitcoin was the very first token in the cryptocurrency world and has achieved much of its growth because of its speculative nature. Simply, it has grown to its current size because of its novelty, its focus on decentralization, and having no reliance on fiat, gold, precious metals, or other standards. Bitcoin has done well by pegging its value against its demand, usability, ubiquity, and technological value.  Dogecoin (DOGE)  Similar to Bitcoin, Dogecoin is not supported by any kind of physical asset or cash flow. True to its name and the nature of its genesis, Dogecoin plays a game of popularity. Being a meme coin, it rises and falls based on how endearing it is in the eyes of its supporters. So far, Dogecoin’s community has been rabid, pushing the value of DOGE mainly because they want to and people are willing to pay for it. In the long run, however, Dogecoin might back its coin with assets in an effort to inject some sense of sustainability into the protocol.  Final thought  Many cryptocurrencies are volatile because investors need to put in the work to create their value. Hence, stablecoins and digital assets pegged to physical assets have emerged to provide security and stability to the cryptocurrency market. With the rise of Uniglo, however, investors are further provided with a social currency that exists to work for them.

For a short while…”  In his words, Hayes “became a believer” in 2020, and he went “long and strong” when he saw a chart depicting how the ETH market capitalization was less than the total market capitalization of all the dapps (decentralized apps) it supported.  “I fervently believe that  offers a credible alternative to the current financial system — and for now, Ethereum is poised to power the world’s financial computer.”  He argued that the Merge is “extremely bullish” for the price of ETH – but also that it has , writing:  “Given all of the forced selling that occurred during the market drop and the poor financial positions that most crypto investors have been left in, the [M]erge does not appear to be priced in– and we have an amazing opportunity to increase Ether positions at very attractive levels.”  Hayes went on to say that he is “more confident today than ever before that the merge will actually occur,” particularly as the miners are “becoming vocal about [its] negative impacts.”  While he said he hasn’t the technical skills to asses whether the Merge will indeed occur in September as , Hayes stressed that “one group of Ethereum network stakeholders who absolutely can handicap the likelihood of success [is] the current crop of Ethereum miners.”  After the Merge, the Ethereum miners’ machines will become worthless unless they can mine on another valuable chain. As a well-known miner Chandler Guo already talked about an Ethereum hard fork, one that would keep a PoW chain, Hayes claimed to have made contact with other Chinese miners who confirmed that this idea is strong in that particular base.  In April, Hayes hinted he might rebalance his investments away from  and in favor of ETH, arguing “a massive wall of money” will enter ETH once it is seen as an ESG (environmental, social, and governance)-friendly, yield-bearing asset. “When the dust settles at year-end, I believe ETH will be trading north of USD 10,000,” he said. In the latest essay, Hayes reiterated the USD 10,000 prediction but didn't specify when it might happen.  At 09:16 UTC, ETH trades at USD 1,658 and is up 2% in a day and down 4% in a week. The price jumped 46% in a month, trimming its annual losses to 39%.  ____"
"162",1342,2022-08-04,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Justin O’Connell is an author and founder of GoldSilverBitcoin.com and a contributor for Bitcoin Magazine.  Socialist regulators worldwide wish to curtail Bitcoin’s consensus method: proof of work. They are cardholders of an environmental, social and governance (  ) cult, seeking carbon neutrality per the Paris Agreement, which was signed in 2015 to limit global warming. In short, they want to roll back civilization to neo-feudal times. Since bitcoin poses competition to central bank fiat currencies, regulators have been instructed by corporate special interests groups that the “Bitcoin Experiment” is bad for the environment and must be stopped.  On July 16, 2022, U.S. Senator Dick Durbin  his displeasure with energy consumption in crypto mining. “It’s time to learn the truth about crypto,” wrote the commie. “Let’s start with the obscene amounts of electricity needed to mine Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Families and businesses in America will pay the price for crypto’s mining ventures.”  It’s important to note that whenever politicians discuss “crypto” mining as it relates to the environmental toll, they are speaking primarily of proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, due to their energy intensity. Specifically, they’re talking about Bitcoin.  United States  The United States, which is home to more than one-third of the global computing power dedicated to mining bitcoin, has turned its attention to domestic miners and their impacts on the environment and local economies. The move has been at the behest of socialist Senator Elizabeth Warren, who  her concern in June 2021 over the environmental toll of proof-of-work (PoW) mining.  On December 2, 2021, Senator Warren  to New York-based bitcoin miner, Greenridge Generation, in which she requested information on the company's environmental footprint. “Given the extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining, mining operations at Greenridge and other plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment, on local ecosystems, and on consumer electricity costs,” the letter noted.  On January 20, 2022, a Committee Hearing on “  ” marked the start of an investigation into the blockchain’s environmental impact, with a particular emphasis on PoW and Bitcoin.  On January 27, 2022, eight Democrat members of Congress, led by Senator Elizabeth Warren, “sent  to six crypto mining companies raising concerns over their extraordinarily high energy uses.”  In the letter, Senator Warren  the same concerns as in the December 2021 letter to Greenridge, stating she and her colleagues observed, “Bitcoin mining’s power consumption has more than tripled from 2019-2021, rivaling the energy consumption of Washington State, and of entire countries like Denmark, Chile, and Argentina.”  Senator Warren requested information from six companies, including Riot Blockchain, Marathon Digital Holdings, Stronghold Digital Mining, Bitdeer, Bitfury Group and Bit Digital. Questions revolved around their mining operations, energy consumption, possible impacts on the climate and local environments, as well as the impact of electricity costs for American consumers.  New York  On June 3, 2022, New York regulators passed a two-year  on proof-of-work mining in the state, citing New York’s Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, which requires New York’s greenhouse gas emissions be cut by 85% by 2050. One section of the bill calls for conducting a statewide study on the environmental impact of proof-of-work mining operations.  Representative Anna Kelles . “My bill is not a ban on Bitcoin,” Kelles gaslit. “It’s not even a ban on crypto-mining. It would not restrict the ability to buy, sell, invest, or use crypto in [New York state].”  New York City Comptroller, Brad Lander, feared a strain on energy caused by mining. “New York state is reaching a pivotal time in its attempt to electrify the energy sector, and the current proof-of-work cryptocurrency mining in New York state diverges from our goals by increasing our reliance on fossil fuels, thereby creating additional financial stressors and endanger investments for New York City,"" he .  The  warns of increased mining in the state. “The continued and expanded operation of cryptocurrency mining operations running proof-of-work authentication methods to validate blockchain transactions will greatly increase the amount of energy usage in the state of New York, and impact compliance with the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act.”  Washington State  The pressure is not just coming from regulators and politicians, but local bureaucrats too. Chelan County, Washington hiked hydroelectric power rates for bitcoin miners by 29%, which went into effect June 1, 2022. The miners there once paid a lower, high-density load rate for their electricity. “What we did as a commission, and what we did as a utility was industry-leading, to create a new rate for this type of demand,” Gary Arseneault, a Chelan County Public Utility District (PUD) commissioner, . For mining companies with substantial investments, Chelan County has reportedly approved a transition plan to increase rates.  Malachi Salcido, CEO of Salcido Enterprises, said the new rate will force him to convert his mining facilities into data farms. “Do you really want to be in the business of regulating what kind of processing happens on servers in your territory,"" Salcido .  Europe  European authorities want to ban bitcoin mining too. Swedish financial regulators and the European Commission considered banning proof-of-work, according to  published by German website netzpolitik.org.  Released under the EU’s freedom-of-information laws, the documents show that at a November 2021 meeting, Swedish financial and environmental regulators and the European Commission’s digital policy arm discussed banning trading in proof-of-work cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin.  An unnamed attendee didn’t “see [the] need to ‘protect’ the bitcoin community,” noting it should be nudged towards the more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake, as Ethereum had done. The documents had been in part redacted due to an “ongoing decision-making process.”  Moreover, the sustainable finance chair at the International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) proposed a proof-of-work mining ban in the European Union in , the EU’s legislation for digital asset governance. The proof-of-work ban, however, was not included in the final bill.  For now, attempts by European lawmakers to ban proof-of-work mining have  to receive the required votes in a EU Parliament committee vote. “It seems that reason and common sense prevailed,” Paris MEP Pierre Person . “We must continue to defend the principle of technological neutrality. Europe must remain in the global competition!”  According to an anonymous  source, there were two alternative compromises related to the watered down version of the ban on unsustainable protocols, all of which were rejected. “The proposal that caused all that mobilization will not be part of the [MiCA] text,” the source added, referring to the widespread opposition to a proof-of-work ban.  Furthermore, the European Green Party  yet another diluted version of the original text. “Crypto assets shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union,” the revised proposal read.  Bitcoin Versus International Communism  Communist regulators, who are in power all over the world, want to ban Bitcoin. Being the gaslighters that they are, they’ll tell you they are not banning Bitcoin — only proof-of-work mining, because Bitcoin can adopt proof-of-stake. They’re fools, and they’ll come for proof-of-stake eventually. Say “no” and educate yourself. There is an international putsch — a secretly plotted and suddenly executed attempt — to end the Bitcoin Experiment; it won’t ever relent and neither can those who wish to live in a world of monetary choice.

The latest BBC report  the lost amount of BTC to be 8,000. A number of earlier claims, as , put that number at USD 7,500.  At the current rate of USD 22,715 per coin, Howells' lost BTC 8,000 is worth around USD 181.7m. The stash was worth nearly half a billion dollars during Bitcoin's peak in mid-April last year.  If recovered, the computer engineer plans to use 10% of its stash, or BTC 800 (USD 18.17m), to turn the city, the landfill of which presumably holds the device, into a crypto-currency hub, according to BBC. He said his donation would be used to promote the use and understanding of cryptocurrency.  ""One of the things we'd like to do on the actual landfill site, once we've cleaned it up and recovered that land is put a power generation facility, maybe a couple of wind turbines,"" Howells said. ""We'd like to set up a community owned (Bitcoin) mining facility which is using that clean electricity to create Bitcoin for the people of Newport.""  Howells also said that he plans to give EUR 50 (USD 51) worth of BTC to every Newport citizen and install crypto-based terminals in all shops.  Newport council, which owns the landfill the drive is allegedly buried in, has repeatedly denied Howells access to dig the site, citing environmental and access concerns.  However, Howells has claimed that he has secured the funding for the operation and has also gathered a team of professionals to handle the task at ""a very high standard.""  ""Digging up a landfill is a huge operation in itself,"" he said. ""The funding has been secured. We've brought on an AI specialist.

"164",1228,2022-08-02,"Brave New Coin","BinaryX, a leading P2E game development company, has released the official whitepaper for Rh!noX, a collection of 10,000 NFTs enabling holders to use their assets as avatars on various GameFi and DeFi applications on the BNB Chain.  The  NFT series gets its inspiration from Soulbound items in the World of Warcraft game and aims to be the first-ever Soulbound Token on the BNB chain. Moreover, the collection links the holders' to their interactions, thus developing them into unique assets. Above all, it provides them with numerous perks, such as access to beta tests for games, NFT whitelists, projects, new tokens on BNB Chain, and more.  The team spent several months improving the project’s vision and roadmap, now available in a new and enhanced whitepaper. For the first time, readers can explore the full functionality of Web3.0 and understand the underlying mechanisms, possibilities, and features of Rh!noX. Here’s a short summary:  The Rh!noX Soulbound Token Analytic System  This feature will calculate the credit score of a wallet depending on its owned amounts and trading history. It works similarly to a credit card company’s standard credit calculation system. Simply put, it determines the perks a user is eligible for, depending on his creditworthiness.  The system will categorize Rh!noX owners into different tiers with distinct benefits. For example, members of the highest tier will enjoy more perks than those in the levels below, with the number and quality of perks decreasing with each tier.  A good credit score will reward NFT holders with numerous advantages, such as:  ● VIP treatment  ● Exclusive Airdrops  ● Airdrops from different projects  ● Closed-beta entry/Early access to DeFi project/Whitelist Slot  ● Discounts on processing fee  ● Unsecured Loan ($RUSD)  The latter is a loan that doesn't require collateral. Also, the maximum amount a user can request depends on their credit rating. The initial fund for the unsecured loan will come from Rh!noX Treasury and represents the income from selling Rh!noX NFTs. Lastly, the loan amount will affect the interest rate and will be collected in $RUSD.  Trading Rh!noX NFTs will not impact the credit rating of their respective owners. Furthermore, the accumulated credit score is connected to an Rh!noX NFT and could be transferred to another user.  Multidimensional Behavior Analysis Model  The system has an in-built cohesive analysis model studying the NFT owner's characteristics, personality, and reliability. To reach this conclusion, the system will consider the wallet’s address and interactions, such as:  ● Trading History  ● On-chain Behavior  ● Project Preferences  ● Asset Portfolio  ● Liability Status  ● Attended Campaigns & Events  ● Airdrops History  Ultimately, this list will expand to include more factors without sacrificing the anonymity of web3.0 technology. Here is a use case of this analysis model.  Rh!Drop  With Rh!Drop, developers can target on-chain users depending on asset values, interests, trading styles, credit ratings, etc. This feature will be an on-chain airdrop targeting service and the primary tool for on-chain project developers. For example, they can use it to deliver airdrops to target receivers matching specific criteria. To better understand the idea, think about Google Ads. Google Ads distributes customized advertisements to selected users based on their past behaviors on the internet.  The suitable ads will be served to the right target audience. Rh!noX works similarly. In simple terms, this does not only benefit project owners but also every user on Web3. Project owners & developers could improve their project awareness and expand their communities easily after identifying the right audience for their projects. At the same time, common users would enjoy the airdrops from different projects or even early information without having to do any additional tasks as long as their overall credibility and ‘personal profile’ are good.    Sociality of Rh!noX NFT  The project also comes with various social features, such as:  Social Identity  Rh!noX Official will verify the individuals’ background. Also, it will allow users to identify the other person's trustability depending on the data the Soulbound Token collects. This way, future Web3.0 users can visit the profile of a wallet address and identify essential details, such as capital level, project preferences, active areas, trading style, etc. This tool also eliminates fake IDs, false claims over assets, and more. Its level of transparency will be accessible to everyone. For instance, if a user has more than 10,000 $BTC in a wallet, it will receive the ""BTC Whale"" title, which should tell developers everything they need to know about this individual.  Rh!neT  This feature will operate like a web3.0 networking platform, enabling users to check someone’s profile, social status, social network, send instant messages, etc. Its main goal is to help users connect and build a community on transparency, credibility, and high-quality identity.  About Rh!noX  Team Rh!noX has extensive experience in the blockchain industry, traditional game development, and game publishing (). The core team members are from Silicon Valley and participated in the development of the early BNB Chain and Polkadot chain and have made outstanding contributions to the development of the industry.  One thing worth mentioning is that before entering the blockchain industry, the team worked in the financial services industry, that's providing loans, mortgages, and wealth management services for many years. Backed by this unique experience, Team Rh!noX fully understands every financial feature of NFT and lays a good foundation for the real-life application of Rh!noX NFT. Team Rh!noX holds a firm conviction that there is a huge and undiscovered space for what NFTs could become and that NFTs should have more than just showing artistic value and signaling wealth.  It was when the team couldn’t stop questioning themselves: What if NFTs could work as certificates? What if NFTs could represent one’s credibility? What if NFTs could work like a Digital Mastercard? What if Rh!noX could build the foundation of social relationships of trust? By solving these questions and putting these ideas together, a wider door will be opened to blockchains, and the ecosystem will become more than just about money, but trustable and fun to stay in. Despite the bearish market, the team believes it is the right time to develop and expand the project to benefit its users. To this end, they added new members and planned future collaborations with other projects to increase the practicality of the Rh!noX ecosystem and beyond. As a result, Rh!noX stands out from the growing crowd of NFT projects, which often lack utility and long-term sustainability. Rh!noX’s utilities aim to cover the entire Web3.0 in the future, not just on the BNB Chain, as it’s the only way to maximize the functionality of Soulbound NFT.  Up to this day, Rh!noX has achieved the following achievements after its first auction sale:  Rh!nox: Sold out in Dutch Auction  * Sold out 10000 units at 9BNX in 4 hours  Rh!nox: Most-traded NFT Collections On Binance NFT Marketplace  * Listed in June and achieved $1.5m trade volume in the last 7D  For more information about Rh!noX visit:   | |  |   Contacts  * Chun B  * marketing@binaryx.pro"

"166",2756,2022-08-01,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Jimmy Song, a Bitcoin developer, educator and entrepreneur and programmer with over 20 years of experience.  I hate politics.  It's a weird zero-sum status game of perception where the winners get to make the rules. Everything is judged on intentions and nothing on results. It offends me as an engineer because it's really a way of saying that reality doesn't matter and that majority opinion can trump facts. It's a collective delusion about how important our opinions are. When discussing politics everyone is the smug, arrogant, smart aleck teen who thinks he knows everything.  What's worse is the fakeness of it all and the faux-intellectual arguments that hold sway. What sounds good wins over reality and only the most sociopathic seem to be able to play the game well enough to win. Propaganda trumps reality and that attitude is infiltrating everything like sand after a beach outing.  Still worse is that politics is so much more consequential because of fiat money. Effective politics now has a prize of immense value in the ability to create money out of nothing. This game of posturing, perception and propaganda kills, steals and destroys. Politics is a zombie horde eating away at civilization and multiplying its destruction through creation of even more zombies.  What I hope to show in this article is just how terrible things have gotten and how nearly everything in our current society has turned political.  The Great Financialization  We've seen almost everything get financialized. Fiat education, fiat healthcare, fiat real estate, fiat companies, even fiat property are all infected with fiat money. You can tell these things are getting finacialized because there are lots of loans and insurance products around them. Student loans, mortgages, health insurance, corporate bonds, car loans, unemployment insurance and even life insurance are evidence of the financialization or government manipulation of each industry. Almost everything can be leveraged for quick consumption and degenerate gambling. It's like we're turning the world into Las Vegas.  Loans and insurance are the gears of the fiat monetary system. Loans create new money and insurance is an outlet for all the leverage from these loans. In various ways, they tax the strong, subsidize the weak, and protect the interests of the people in power. Each financialized industry adds yet more rent-seekers, as more people leverage their way into consumption rather than earning their way. In a financialized world, everyone becomes Wimpy from the Popeye cartoons, the guy that will “gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today.”  Financialization is really the process of fiat money taking over. That is, it's the subjection of an industry to the control of the government. And the companies go along with it because it's much easier than actually innovating. Why strive when you don't have to? Corporate welfare is not that different from normal welfare, just much more expensive. They both remove incentives to be productive or provide value. Every financialized industry slowly debases into DMV-like inefficiency as they grow fat on fiat subsidization.  Financialization has a bigger problem than just the non-productivity of the subsidized entities. The bigger problem is that they become endorsers of the state. Once you take the king's coin, you become the king's man.  Messing With The Market  The main effect of financialization is that it props up companies that would otherwise go bankrupt. By loaning companies money or their customers money to buy that industry's products, the entire industry gets subsidized. These companies become like that guy that always seems to get into trouble and gets bailed out by family. Financialization incentivizes mediocrity.  In other words, merit takes a back seat whenever fiat money gets involved. Instead of market forces creating better goods and services, worse goods and services continue to be pushed onto the market, usually at cheaper prices to compensate for their lack of quality. This is the real reason subsidized industries produce inferior goods. Subsidization leads to debasement of goods and services. If you're wondering why products and services have gotten much worse during the pandemic, there's your answer; it's inflation-subsidized mediocrity.  What takes the front seat instead are political considerations. Right now in the U.S., these considerations include how diverse the executive team is, how environmentally friendly the products are and how much they support the war in Ukraine. These political considerations are called “environmental, social, and corporate governance” (ESG) and they have nothing to do with profit and everything to do with perception and propaganda. The government gets to create its own sock puppets in industry to give themselves more power.  This is nothing new. In other political regimes, industries had to align with war efforts, racial segregation, ethnic cleansing and worse. The more authoritarian a government is, the more aligned you have to be, so Nazis and Communists demanded much more political compliance than, say the 19th century U.S. government. The politicization of industry is an indicator of how authoritarian the government is getting. The past two years have shown this with vaccine mandates, Black Lives Matter support and the Ukraine war support.  The main tool at play is money. Financialization guarantees alignment with the people in power. Entire industries get bought and enslaved by the money printer. Needless to say, this isn't good for the people and they carry the heavy burden of supporting all this with the debasement of their savings.  The People In Power  The incentives of the people in power are horribly misaligned with what's actually good for the people. Because elected officials are typically not around very long, they tend to have a very short-term focus. That is, they're generally high time-preference and politics reflects that. Every elected official is like the many millions today living paycheck-to-paycheck, covering today’s bills only, with no regard for planning for tomorrow  I first started paying attention to U.S. presidential politics in 1988. Every single presidential election I've observed has been called ""the most important election of our lifetime."" And it's not just one side, it's both sides and they encourage this sort of thinking. The people that win in politics have a higher time preference than the people who win the lottery.  How many political scandals last more than a week these days? What seems so important this week is forgotten three weeks later by almost everyone. The people in power have the attention span of squirrels. What matters to people in politics is now and there's little concern for what will happen to civilization tomorrow.  Deference To Power  Yet despite this obvious lack of prudence or wisdom on the part of our leaders, there is a significant deference to their opinions. Unsurprisingly, this means most people become likewise very high time preference, or impulsive and imprudent. You wouldn't normally trust an impulsive person to be the designated driver, for example, yet people defer to government leaders because of the significant power they hold. To disobey would mean getting canceled. Financialization has hit everyone and noncompliance means economic death.  In that sense, every CEO of a large company is really a political officer. They have the power to dispense favors because they have the newly printed money at their disposal through loans. It's no wonder these positions have gotten so political. Currying favor with the money printers through marketing is much more important for a CEO now than actually making good products.  Instead of deferring to the market, companies defer to power. It's no wonder so many industries have seen little-to-no innovation for decades. Noncompliance means economic death and subsidization means stagnation. Not a great environment to thrive as a business.  And guess who gets screwed? Instead of customers, the community or society at large being the beneficiaries of the company's goods, we get the people in power getting all the benefits. CEOs, politicians and investment bankers get to advance their agenda at our cost.  Whatever Is Convenient For The Powerful  The powerful get what they want at the expense of everyone else. In a badly aligned system like politics, this typically means destruction of value. Rent-seekers will spend other people's money for their own benefit without providing value to anyone. This often includes creating more rent-seeking positions! The zombie horde grows.  Instead of new innovations, regulations keep out any competition for current incumbents. Nuclear power hasn't progressed since the 70s, and neither have airlines. Gee, ?  This is unfortunately the normal course of business as financialization has essentially put the power of money printing into the hands of the politically connected. Becoming friends with the politically connected pays better than creating a useful good or service. It'd be like selecting a quarterback based on who's good friends with the team owner. It's not going to lead to much progress or prosperity.  Bitcoin And Politics  If this whole thing so far sounds depressing, that's because it is. There's no question that the financialization has gotten worse, the subsidization more abundant, and politics more ubiquitous. Yet there's one thing that we've seen going against the tide of all this destruction of value: Bitcoin.  We saw that Bitcoin was different five years ago during the Blocksize Wars. One side was a powerful group of well-connected CEOs who made a consensus among themselves about what Bitcoin should be. They wanted to define and control Bitcoin through changes in its protocol.  On the other side were the users. They are what would be considered irrelevant in politics. In the normal course of politics, these were at best people that could easily be manipulated by propaganda and at worst, people that could be canceled.  At this point, any outside observer would have predicted that the powerful companies would win. They were the better political players and knew how to take power in any governance structure. This was a professional football team going against the JV team of a local high school. One side seemed poised to easily get what they want and use politics to get it. Whether through regulation, subsidization or cancellation, the CEOs had tools to get what they want.  But something strange happened; the JV team started to win. And the reason was because there's no central authority in Bitcoin. There wasn't a group to bribe. There wasn't any governance board to appeal to. They had to deal with the market, the people, the users. They couldn't bypass them with some authority that could change the rules for them. We found out that they weren't a professional football team as much as they had the refs in their pocket. Bitcoin created a fair match.  And the users, the people, or the market responded. They said no. And won.  Bitcoin Is Anti-Political  There were a lot of people that were betting on the side of the corporations and the powerful. These were seasoned pros when it came to propaganda and politics and surely, they would figure out a way to defeat some plebs on Twitter? Yet they couldn't. The corporations couldn't change Bitcoin because Bitcoin was different. The users got to decide what was and wasn't Bitcoin. The playing field was frustratingly fair and level, much to the detriment of the people specializing in influencing the refs.  Bitcoiners not only resisted the protocol changes, but any attempts to represent them by proxy. Erik Voorhees famously claimed that they represented them because these users were these companies' customers. The market spoke clearly and loudly in the futures markets that this was not the case. Despite all the money and resources clearly being on one side of the debate, the plebs won. The users had a voice, not through some intermediary or trusted third party, but directly, through the market. And they spoke. It turns out that we were the professional football team all along and they were the JV team that specialized in bribing refs. The plebs won and it wasn't particularly close.  Bitcoin is anti-political. It resists political processes because changes require consensus. Even a small minority can resist changes to the rules. There's no bribing the ref or the rules committee. Bitcoin took politics out of the equation.  Altcoins Are Political  Contrast this to altcoins and the difference couldn't be more stark. Altcoins operate completely at a political level, controlling the perception of the public through massive propaganda campaigns. They are in the habit of subsidizing anything and everything that makes their coin look good while spreading FUD about anything that makes their coin look bad.  They defer completely to the people in power, like the creator or foundation. They bribe influencers and give them rent-seeking positions. They rob people blind while telling them it's good for them.  If you doubt me, think through this thought experiment. Would an altcoin have been able to resist the  from five years ago? The answer is no. The people in charge of the altcoin would have decided and that would have been it. Indeed, SegWit2x-like agreements are happening all the time in Altcoinland. They are called hard forks and show how centralized and political these coins are.  Bitcoin Is Living The U.S. Constitution's Ideal  Interestingly, consensus-driven decision making was the original design of the U.S. Constitution. It was supposed to be very difficult for any law to get passed and for a while, even one senator could derail it. That meant every change and every law had to take into consideration everyone that it would affect. If it didn't satisfy all those people, then it wouldn't get passed. Unfortunately, this changed as the checks and balances kept getting debased. Changes to the rules came easier and easier even as the economy stagnated.  Unlike the U.S. government, Bitcoin fulfills this idea that every person has a say. You can't just take stuff away from someone without their consent. Cynically, you can say that politics is the agreement by the majority to take stuff from the minority. That's simply not possible with Bitcoin. It's for that reason that Bitcoin is anti-political.  If you hate politics, you'll love Bitcoin. Happy Bitcoin Independence Day.  Twelve New Altcoins Coming Soon:  * WomanCoin - Coins for women only, with the board of governors that decide what a woman is, not you because you're not a biologist.  * Diffirand - Founded by an academic that got tired of scamming a few undergrads and decided to scam the entire public instead.  * BitcoinNakamoto - A fork of Bitcoin for those that believe a16z should own Satoshi's coins.  * BytePecunia - Privacy-focused coin that guarantees nothing, like say, supply, future governance or even privacy.  * Methamphetamine - A coin that keeps promising to change everything based on the fanciful ideas of its teenage founder, but fails to deliver because said teenage founder can't code nor has any interest in doing so because of the premine.  * Trinium - Founded by some Asian guy to market to a billion Asians, but nobody in the West cares because it's only Asians that are getting hurt.  * Catastrophe - Get 18% yield until the price doesn't go up anymore at which point it's a -100% yield, unless you're one of the people at the top in which case you get a 20,000% yield.  * Cripple - A coin with a blockchain/database run on a piece of paper with pencil, to be better for the environment.  * Daschund - It's got a cute logo and does nothing, but the hope is that a billionaire will someday jerk around the public with it.  * Salami - A token in a SQL database run by ex-Wall Street investment bankers to screw over the public even more.  * Sucker - Recruit 10 people to get rewarded with staking coins which can be redeemed in three years when the founder will be in prison!  * SeedOilSwap - A governance token for a platform that allows exchange of synthetic asset swaps that are enforced algorithmically through the drool coming out of your ape NFT.

"167",322,2022-08-01,"U.Today","Alex Dovbnya  Upgrade would have been exciting years ago, but this is not true today, according to Arthur Breitman  While the industry is waiting for Ethereum's  transition with bated breath, some of its key players believe that the much-anticipated upgrade is not a big deal.  Arthur Breitman, co-founder of rival network Tezos,  that the upcoming Merge event would not be an accomplishment. He added that virtually every other blockchain had already moved to proof of stake.  Breitman has noted that the upgrade was supposed to take place years ago, which is why he does not understand why there is so much press coverage devoted to the long-overdue upgrade.  Anatoly Yakovenko, the software engineer behind Solana Labs, echoed the same sentiment. He believes that the much-hyped upgrade will not affect the cryptocurrency industry in any substantial way.  When it was proposed for the first time in 2016, proof of stake was still a relatively novel idea. However, the transition proved to be complicated, which is why the Merge has been plagued by countless delays. In March, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin admitted that switching to a simpler form of proof of stake years ago would have resulted in less environmental damage. Ethereum could have avoided a heavybacklash from climate activists.  As , Ethereum's upcoming switch to proof-of-stake will bode well for its green cred since it will dramatically reduce the blockchain's energy consumption. The Merge is also expected to make Ethereum deflationary, which means that the token will potentially be more scarce.  At the same time, it should be noted that the upgrade will not fix Ethereum's scaling woes. After the Merge, the network will have to go through a series of other important upgrades before the network reaches its envisaged potential."
"168",1523,2022-07-31,"Cryptonews.com","Anton Chashchin is a Managing Partner at the digital assets platform .  __________  The days when cryptocurrencies were reserved for the underground are fast becoming history. But the power dynamics in finance are all too familiar.  As cryptocurrencies edge into the mainstream – with global adoption  in June 2021 compared with the year prior – opinions in the institutional world remain split. While some financial leaders – like  – are  to their crypto holdings, the general support for adoption among the rank and file continues to be overridden by scepticism. The recent crypto crash has only exacerbated this, with many institutions  of the market and furthering the cynicism.  Older , in particular, feel compelled to defend the foundations of traditional finances against the more radical characteristics of the crypto movement: decentralization, anonymity, and, in their eyes, instability.  Facing a challenge to the status quo, institutions now find themselves at a historically precedented fork in the road: Thucydides’ trap.  The Thucydides Trap is a political theory describing a scenario in which a rising power challenges the dominance of existing power. The dominant power, when threatened, becomes paranoid and is likely to respond with war.  Although the original applied to Sparta and Athens of ancient Greece, this applies to the relationship between the crypto industry and financial institutions.  That sentiment is encapsulated by the comments of the well-known opponent of cryptocurrencies and the embodiment of traditional finance, , who  in an interview with CNBC, “Cryptocurrencies basically have no value, and they don’t produce anything. I don’t have any cryptocurrency and I never will.”  This paranoia has grown as institutions have come to realise that the world of cryptocurrencies can create not just competition for them, but even a significant threat. The cryptocurrency markets are constantly expanding, both in size and sophistication.  Some have accepted the rise of crypto as inevitable. 52% of financial institutions now own cryptocurrencies and many have recently launched crypto capabilities, including investment banking giants like , asset management stalwarts like , and infrastructure payments pioneers like , as well as established Fintechs like .  But for those financial institutions that are preparing for war, they need not fall into the trap. Institutions that can lay their ego aside and open themselves to the opportunities inherent in crypto will be able to leverage the rise of digital assets to fuel their own growth.  However, to encourage a fruitful relationship between institutions and the crypto industry, four key changes must take place.  1) Bolster knowledge with third-party expertise  Cryptocurrencies are fundamentally new and evolving assets, meaning institutions can find it hard to keep up with the latest capabilities – particularly newer entrants. Many are asking a lot of the same questions: what is ? What is ? Is it safe? How can they get involved?  In response to a general dearth of crypto knowledge and capabilities among institutional investors, Wall Street has been  an army of crypto experts, with thousands of new crypto jobs at top firms since 2018.  But the demand for knowledge far outweighs the supply.  There is a lot to learn, and it’s hard to find the right talent to support pilot projects. Not all institutional investors have time to train their staff in order to successfully branch into the space.  What’s more, the current market downturn is forcing many crypto companies to lay off employees – with the largest US crypto exchange, ,  of 1,100 employees. Top bankers are optimistic that this round of cuts will widen the pool of crypto talent available, resulting in many returning to banking, a sector that remains desperate for tech talent.  Additionally, to supplement a human resources-focused approach, institutions can call on external support from a number of third-party companies, which have emerged as institutional demand for expertise has grown.  Such companies can support firms in building crypto services and integrating crypto into their business. In choosing reliable partners and hiring experienced consultants, institutions can realise their crypto ambitions.  2) A robust, globally coherent regulatory framework  Prevailing suspicions among institutional leaders are, at least in part, motivated by a necessity to protect the customer at all costs. The recent volatility in the market has heightened suspicions that cryptocurrencies are a scam, or a bubble that could burst, damaging their clients, business, and the wider economy.  Considering each move in crypto follows extensive risk assessment, business planning, and board approval, these concerns stall , and go some way to explaining why some firms have yet to take their first steps.  In many ways, it’s a legitimate concern. Cryptocurrencies do come with their fair share of compliance headaches, coupled with a general lack of governance.  International regulation ranges from supportive but nascent – as in the case of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) – to actively condemnatory – as in the case of , which has  digital assets outright.  On top of this, the crypto ecosystem is fast-evolving, making it hard for  to keep up. For example, most markets are still yet to implement policies on Bitcoin and , let alone more recent digital phenomena like Non-Fungible Tokens (  ) and decentralised finance (  ).  As traditional financial companies have both a responsibility to their clients and strict standards to uphold relating to investing and trading, they must remain compliant, which makes them nervous about volatile, undefined, and ungoverned assets like cryptocurrencies.  Although crypto may be perceived as a wild and unregulated asset – and perhaps even a dangerous one, given the recent crash in valuations –  ’s recent  has shown the opposite, providing vital financial services to .  Nevertheless, despite the volatility and fears around a “crypto winter”, a recent report showed that the investor interest in the sector has not frozen – suggesting that the momentum of mainstream digital asset adoption is set to continue.  As client engagement grows, and the adoption of crypto assets continues, major crypto  and other players in the space are already cooperating with lawmakers on sanctions and other monitoring tools.  This already indicates the beginning of the formation of a common regulatory framework that can no longer be denied.  Rather than responding to ambiguities by avoiding cryptocurrencies altogether, institutions should be taking the reins in advocating for stronger protections and more robust regulatory frameworks that will allow them to launch into digital assets more confidently.  3) Addressing environmental concerns  Finance companies have a growing list of voluntary and mandatory environmental standards to uphold in a landscape that is increasingly . Many institutions, therefore, cannot invest in areas or work with companies that are not environmentally friendly.  This is problematic from a crypto perspective in light of recent revelations surrounding Bitcoin ,  to use the same amount of energy as a small country.   from the European asset manager Candrium in 2021 has made the case that cryptocurrencies more broadly have a long way to go to satisfy ESG criteria.  But this is only the start of the story. Recognizing the need to reduce the carbon footprint of the technology, the market has already begun investigating ways to reduce energy consumption by making upgrades to the network or through other means, such as offsetting carbon use as some crypto mining companies have done.  Strides have been taken by some blockchains, like Ethereum, which is migrating away from the notoriously energy-intensive proof-of-work (  ) model. The transition to the proof-of-stake (  ) mechanism is set to make Ethereum’s carbon footprint over 17,000 more efficient than Bitcoin.  While this should be championed, more needs to be done across the industry to offset crypto’s environmental impact.  In order to tip the balance of the ESG scale and allow for institutional involvement, greater investment as well as a regulator-led approach, is required in this space – and institutions can play a major role in driving this forward.  4) Greater awareness around crypto’s social benefits  While the environmental aspect is currently dominating conversations surrounding ESG, the social and governance aspects should not be forgotten, as they are areas where cryptocurrencies are superior to fiat money.  The fundamentally open source, borderless nature of the blockchain technology on which crypto is built means it has the potential to create more inclusive, democratic financial systems.  Institutions looking for a non-environmental leg up in the ESG space would do well to remember this.  Time for a choice  Institutions have a choice to make: give in to the hubris of hegemons throughout history and push back against crypto, or form an alliance with the rising power. Many big financial firms have slowly come around, but there remains a level of Thucydidean paranoia.  As the market expands, and the solutions and surrounding regulatory ecosystems along with it, institutional confidence can and will rise.  By working with an established partner in the space, institutions can make the most of crypto’s new dawn and ensure they come down on the right side of history.  ____"
"169",2807,2022-07-30,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Kudzai Kutukwa, a passionate financial inclusion advocate who was recognized by Fast Company magazine as one of South Africa’s top-20 young entrepreneurs under 30.  Our society today is plagued by a trust problem. The institutions that govern our world are built on trust while they have now proven to be untrustworthy. On February 11, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto posted  stating,  “I've developed a new open source P2P e-cash system called Bitcoin. It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. […] The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.”  By developing a decentralized monetary system that made trusted third parties (the banking system) obsolete, Nakamoto also chipped away at the source of their power: the money printer. It’s the money printer that made it possible for a small clique of central bankers to centralize and seize control of the global monetary system. Though waning, they continue to wield this power to this day.  The top-down, centralized decision-making structure is not unique to central banking, but it pervades all spectra of the political institutions that govern our society today. The World Economic Forum (WEF), the Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the United Nations are but a few examples of the central planners of our day responsible for setting policy recommendations and regulatory frameworks that range from interest rates to carbon emissions. While, for the most part, these organizations are credible and trustworthy, more often than not, the policy recommendations they make create more harm than good when implemented at the community level. A recent example of this would be Sri Lanka, which is not only bankrupt, but is also experiencing hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials such as food, fuel and medicine.  While this economic collapse was caused by numerous factors; one of the biggest factors behind Sri Lanka’s demise is its support for “  i.e., prioritizing ESG compliance over food production. The megazord acronym “ESG” is the brainchild of the U.N. and stands for environmental, social and governance. It’s meant to be a set of investment criteria that guide corporations and governments to “further develop sustainable investments.” Sri Lanka has an exceptional  of 98 that trumps that of both Sweden (96) and the US (51). In order to achieve their ESG-inspired, virtue-signaling goal of being the first “organic country,” the government abruptly  in April 2021. This led to a dramatic drop in yields across the board and by the time the government realized their blunder and tried reversing course in November 2021, the damage had already been done.  (  )  According to environmental activist ,  “[O]ne-third of Sri Lanka’s farm lands  in 2021 due to the fertilizer ban. Over 90% of Sri Lanka’s farmers had used chemical fertilizers before they were banned. After they were banned, an astonishing 85%  crop losses. The numbers are shocking. After the fertilizer ban, rice production fell 20% and prices skyrocketed  in just six months. Sri Lanka had to import $450 million worth of rice despite having been self-sufficient in the grain just months earlier. The price of carrots and tomatoes  five-fold. While there are just two million farmers in Sri Lanka, 15 million of the country’s22 million people are directly or indirectly dependent on farming.”  The bigger question is, how on Earth did Sri Lanka find itself in such a self-inflicted mess? Well, the short answer is: They were ill-advised by the likes of the WEF to go down this path of protecting the environment at the expense of severely compromising their food security. ESG has officially collapsed its first country, just like the  did in the 1980s and 1990s.  In a , penned in collaboration with the WEF, economist Joseph Stiglitz showered praise on Sri Lanka’s overall economic development and wrote, “Given its education levels, Sri Lanka may be able to move directly into more technologically advanced sectors, high-productivity organic farming, and higher-end tourism.”  It is this very prescription that has failed dismally and the people of Sri Lanka are now facing the dire consequences of economic destruction, not “experts” like Joseph Stiglitz. What is suggested as a solution for the devastation caused by terrible ideas? More horrendous ideas from the institutions that caused the initial problem. In April 2022, as the government was negotiating with the IMF for a bailout, the United Nations Development Programme doubled down  that the Sri Lankan government should become a candidate for a “  ” that would unlock debt relief in exchange for investing a fixed sum on nature conservation. Furthermore, in May 2022, Sri Lanka signed onto a green finance  with the International Finance Corporation that, among other things, includes a commitment to organic fertilizers. It appears that they are determined to hold the line in support of ""the current thing.""  Despite the apparent failure of these policies in Sri Lanka, the Dutch government also threw their hat into the ring and is actively pursuing similar policies. The Dutch government is  in overall nitrogen greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. A 25 billion euro Nitrogen Fund was set up to help farmers (voluntarily) quit, relocate or downsize their business and make them more “nature friendly” (e.g. organic farming just like in Sri Lanka). The Dutch Minister for Nitrogen and Nature Policy, Ms. Christianne van der Wal, indicated that she expects about one-third of the Netherlands’ 50,000 farms to disappear by 2030 as a result of the plans and went on to point out that  was on the table as a measure of last resort should the farmers refuse to cooperate. Is this the part where they will   (  )  Furthermore, in order to comply with this draconian emissions target decreed by the government,  of all cows, chickens and pigs will have to be culled. This has sparked protests by farmers who object to these green dictates. These protests are reminiscent of the Canadian Trucker protests earlier this year, and we have now seen farmers from Spain, Italy, Germany and Poland  in a show of solidarity with their Dutch counterparts.  In addition to being the second largest exporter of food in the world after the U.S., the Netherlands is also the largest exporter of meat within the EU. Should the Dutch central planners have their way, it’s likely the Netherlands will join Sri Lanka on the list of countries destroyed by “the current thing.” Similarly, in an effort to cut emissions by half by 2030, both the  and . currently have different versions of “pay farmers to not farm” schemes in place. 35,000 acres of rice fields  will remain unused, while in the U.K., dairy and meat farmers are  to retire in exchange for a one-time payment of up to 100,000 pounds. The Canadian government also intends to implement  in an effort to reduce nitrogen greenhouse gasses by 30% by the year 2030. Not to be outdone, the New Zealand government  to tax livestock for belching and flatulence, which they hope will reduce emissions. Such is the infinite wisdom of the central planners running the world today.  On the surface, ESG virtue-signaling may look like overzealous attempts by governments to do obeisance to “the current thing” in meeting their emissions targets, but these policies do seem like deliberate attempts to massively shrink the farming sector while nationalizing agricultural land in the process. According to the U.N., there is a looming food catastrophe . In a recent report, the World Food Program warned that 670 million people on average will be on the verge of starvation by the . If this is true, why are governments around the world hindering the work of farmers?  While the WEF central planners are actively promoting “climate-smart” farming methods to make  to net-zero, nature-positive food systems by 2030, the catastrophe in Sri Lanka is proof that it’s a path that likely ends in disaster. While this approach works for smaller communities, as of today, organic farming alone isn’t enough to sustain large-scale farming. A full switch to organic farming would require more land use — something the Dutch don’t have a lot of — and thus, more agricultural inputs to match current production levels required to feed large urban populations. Ironically, organic farming is unsustainable both economically and environmentally. For example, a permanent transition to organic production in Sri Lanka would reduce  of every major crop; about 30% for coconut, 50% for tea, 50% for corn and 35% for rice. Why any sane government would embark on such a radical experiment is mind boggling.  , ESG is the fastest growing asset management class, which currently has $35 trillion assets under management and is expected to exceed $50 trillion by 2025. Despite sounding altruistic on the surface, ESG is actually a political metric that is used to indirectly control private companies by central planners through influencing the direction of capital flows to investments that they deem “sustainable.”  It’s a mechanism to further centralize capital markets in the hands of the central planners who get to pick winners and losers based on adherence to a subjective and opaque criteria, instead of on the basis of value created. ESG is analogous to feudalism, in that an elite group of central planners and their cantillionaire cronies allocate capital to causes that further enrich themselves in the name of “social good.” This state of affairs is in stark contrast to Bitcoin which upends this dynamic by guaranteeing inalienable property rights to all participants within the network, not just to an elite few. In the same way that the Chinese Communist Party’s social credit system scores an individual based on their allegiance to the state, corporate companies as well as nation-states pledge their fealty to woke institutional investors and the Davos elite with their ESG scores.  ESG is a mirror image of our fiat monetary system that distorts price signals within the economy, making it almost impossible to accurately measure which economic activities are creating the most value. Just like the fiat system, ESG adherence also encourages misallocation of capital resources and disrupts meaningful productivity.  that ESG is not only confusing and opaque, but is also vulnerable to rampant  With this in mind, it is astonishing that sovereign states are jostling over each other to obtain higher ESG scores by implementing policies that are self-destructive. How can an unjust monetary system produce a just society? Or as Jeff Booth puts it in “  ” “How is it possible to solve climate change from an economic system that requires inflation?” Any nation or company that destroys its productive capacity will collapse no matter how high their ESG score is.  (  )  In his classic essay,  renowned Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek wrote,  “The economic problem of society is thus not merely a problem of how to allocate ‘given’ resources—if ‘given’ is taken to mean given to a single mind which deliberately solves the problem set by these ‘data.’ It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only these individuals know. Or, to put it briefly, it is a problem of the utilization of knowledge which is not given to anyone in its totality.”  Central planners are not omniscient and therefore cannot accurately steer an entire economy that is composed of infinite complex systemic interactions that each require specialized knowledge. Knowledge which isn’t resident in any single individual or institution. Despite this obvious fact, a handful of central planners are slowly collapsing food production with their policies that do not factor in the unintended consequences of their decisions.  As a fully decentralized system, Bitcoin is the antithesis of central planning. It didn’t just become the beacon of a more just financial system but it represents a more superior governance model. Thanks to proof of work, all the nodes are able to arrive at the same truth independently without a central authority’s coordination. The true embodiment of rules without rulers.  Our current financial system is fueled by credit expansion and consumption. Such a system requires exponential growth to sustain itself. The end result is that the money supply continues to expand and money gradually loses its ability to coordinate economic activities efficiently. Price signals are mutilated in the process, thus erecting an economic Tower of Babel.  ESG is an attack vector that gains control of capital markets through this endless manipulation of money. The monetary policies that are being pursued globally by central planners are at odds with technological gains that would result in lower prices of goods over time. Instead, society is being kept on the treadmill of ever-increasing prices that require more consumption and more production ad infinitum in order to protect a credit-based system that would otherwise implode.  Political metrics like ESG do not hold sway over Bitcoin because it’s a monetary system that is anchored in objective truth. This opens up the room for capital allocation based solely on economic potential and value created — as opposed to “woke” capital allocation. De-growth strategies, top-down centralized management of resources and control of capital allocation via ESG are features (not bugs) of the current financial system. Countries like Sri Lanka are prime examples of the destruction ESG has caused.  The attacks clothed as ESG that are being meted out against farmers are strikingly similar to those that are usually directed at bitcoin miners. As the most secure computer network in the world, Bitcoin is censorship resistant and doesn’t bow to the tyrannical whims of central planners who have intentions of weaponizing the financial system against protesters. Unlike the Dutch farmland that is at risk of being confiscated, bitcoin cannot be confiscated via legislation; it’s money that you truly own. It’s for this reason that the energy usage of bitcoin mining has been incessantly attacked by ESG evangelists through  that portray bitcoin mining as an existential threat to the environment. This has resulted in some jurisdictions, like the EU, considering banning proof-of-work mining, like how the Dutch government is trying to get rid of some of its farmers. The truth is, bitcoin mining’s energy mix has the  of any industry in the world, plus it  that would have otherwise been wasted. A fact the ESG warriors conveniently ignore.  The time has come for the creation of bitcoin circular economies and for us to support our farmers in order to protect our food systems from Malthusian central planners. Instead of bowing to their zero-sum worldview, trade groups like the  should become the norm. These bitcoin-based commodity markets and/or exchanges can also play a big role in providing farmers with access to global markets in a frictionless manner. In addition, orange-pilling nation states is now more important than ever for two major reasons: First, it will give nations alternatives for raising capital, like the , that are not tied to “woke” capital with diabolical strings attached. Second, it will produce examples of the prosperity a nation with sound money can achieve. Samson Mow and JAN3 are doing great work on this front, but there is room for more to join.  In conclusion, should current trends of kowtowing to ESG by governments continue, Sri Lanka will end up being a harbinger of larger things to come in the months ahead.

As a PoS network, Ethereum will be free from the endless criticism that Bitcoin and Ethereum Classic face with respect to their high carbon footprint. The PoW transaction validation model requires the use of highly advanced machines that are manufactured by tech giants like Bitmain to solve complex computations before transactions are approved, added to the block, and generated a new token as a reward for the miners.  This system will be replaced by the more energy-efficient PoS model, which will now position Ethereum over Ethereum Classic concerning sustainability concerns.

Under , growth slows from last year’s 6.1 percent to 3.2 percent this year and 2.9 percent next year, downgrades of 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points from April. This reflects stalling growth in the world’s three largest economies—the United States, China, and the euro area—with important consequences for the global outlook.  In the United States, reduced household purchasing power and tighter monetary policy will drive growth down to 2.3 percent this year and 1 percent next year. In China, further lockdowns, and the deepening real estate crisis pushed growth down to 3.3 percent this year—the slowest in more than four decades, excluding the pandemic. And in the euro area, growth is revised down to 2.6 percent this year and 1.2 percent in 2023, reflecting spillovers from the war in Ukraine and tighter monetary policy.  Despite slowing activity, global inflation has been revised up, in part due to rising food and energy prices. Inflation this year is anticipated to reach 6.6 percent in advanced economies and 9.5 percent in emerging market and developing economies—upward revisions of 0.9 and 0.8 percentage points respectively—and is projected to remain elevated longer. Inflation has also broadened in many economies, reflecting the impact of cost pressures from disrupted supply chains and historically tight labor markets.  The risks to the outlook are overwhelmingly tilted to the downside:  *  could lead to a sudden stop of European gas flows from Russia  * Inflation could remain stubbornly high if labor markets remain overly tight or inflation expectations de-anchor, or disinflation proves more costly than expected  * Tighter global financial conditions could induce a surge in debt distress in emerging market and developing economies  * Renewed COVID-19 outbreaks and lockdowns might further suppress China’s growth  * Rising food and energy prices could cause widespread food insecurity and social unrest  * Geopolitical fragmentation might impede global trade and cooperation.  In a plausible alternative scenario where some of these risks materialize, including a , inflation will rise and global growth decelerate further to about 2.6 percent this year and 2 percent next year—a pace that growth has fallen below just five times since 1970. Under this scenario, both the United States and the euro area experience near-zero growth next year, with negative knock-on effects for the rest of the world.  Policy priorities  Inflation at current levels represents a clear risk for current and future macroeconomic stability and bringing it back to  targets should be the top priority for policymakers. In response to incoming data, central banks of major advanced economies are withdrawing monetary support faster than we expected in April, while many in emerging market and developing economies had already started raising interest rates last year.  The resulting synchronized monetary tightening across countries is historically unprecedented, and its effects are expected to bite, with global growth slowing next year and inflation decelerating. Tighter monetary policy will inevitably have real economic costs, but delaying it will only exacerbate the hardship. Central banks that have started tightening should stay the course until inflation is tamed.  Targeted fiscal support can help cushion the impact on the most vulnerable. But with government budgets stretched by the pandemic and the need for an overall disinflationary macroeconomic policy stance, offsetting targeted support with higher  or lower government spending will ensure that fiscal policy does not make the job of monetary policy even harder.  As advanced economies raise interest rates to fight inflation, financial conditions are tightening, especially for their emerging-market counterparts. Countries must appropriately use macroprudential tools to safeguard financial stability. Where flexible exchange rates are insufficient to absorb external shocks, policymakers will need to be ready to implement foreign exchange interventions or capital flow management measures in a crisis scenario.  Such challenges come at a time when many countries lack fiscal space, with the share of low-income countries in or at high risk of debt distress at 60 percent, up from about 20 percent a decade ago. Higher borrowing costs, diminished credit flows, a stronger dollar, and weaker growth will push even more into distress.  Debt-resolution mechanisms remain slow and unpredictable, hampered by difficulties in obtaining coordinated agreements from diverse creditors over their competing claims. Recent progress in implementing the  is encouraging, but further improvements are still urgently needed.  Domestic policies to address the impacts of high energy and food prices should focus on those most affected without distorting prices. Governments should refrain from hoarding food and energy and instead look to unwind barriers to trade, such as food export bans, which drive world prices higher. As the pandemic continues, governments must step up vaccination campaigns, resolve vaccine distribution bottlenecks, and ensure equitable access to treatment.  Finally, mitigating climate change continues to require prompt multilateral action to limit emissions and raise investment to hasten the . The war in Ukraine and soaring energy prices have put pressure on governments to turn to fossil fuels such as coal as a stopgap measure. Policymakers and regulators should ensure such measures are temporary and only cover energy shortfalls, not increase emissions overall. Credible and comprehensive climate policies to increase green energy supply should be accelerated urgently. The energy crisis also illustrates how a policy of clean, green energy independence can be compatible with national security objectives.  The outlook has darkened significantly since April. The world may soon be teetering on the edge of a global recession, only two years after the last one. Multilateral cooperation will be key in many areas, from climate transition and pandemic preparedness to food security and debt distress. Amid great challenge and strife, strengthening cooperation remains the best way to improve economic prospects and mitigate the risk of .  __  The article was first published on .  ____"

As opposed to other altcoins, this ensures the long-term sustainability of the SOL coin. Solana (SOL) has a long way to go to arrive closer to it's all time high. Solana (SOL) investors are worried and fear more drops are coming.  Cardano (ADA) has a long way to go to arrive back at ATH  The native cryptocurrency of Cardano, ADA, is one of the top 10 by market capitalization. Although ADA has lagged behind the other top ten assets, the price recently crossed the first Bollinger band. The last time this occurred, the coin increased by 20% in a single day.  Defi researchers almost unanimously agree that Cardano (ADA) is one of the most oversold coins on the market. According to a new poll of 53 industry experts, the ADA may be time for a run. The consensus is that ADA will likely increase by 6X by 2030. However we can’t see Cardano (ADA) making any significant gains anytime soon.

"179",791,2022-07-22,"Brave New Coin","After retreating for a moment on the news that Tesla had sold off most of its BTC holdings, Bitcoin has quickly recovered its positive momentum.  A 2nd quarter earnings report has revealed that electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla has sold 75% of its Bitcoin holdings. These holdings were worth ~US$936 million.  The firm, which is founded by technologist Elon Musk explained in a shareholder presentation that “Bitcoin impairment” had had a negative impact on the profitability of the firm. In Quarter 2, the price of BTC dropped from ~US$45,530 to ~US$20,110, a sharp ~55% drop. Tesla says the remaining value of its Bitcoin sits at $US218 million, in the previous quarter the firm’s BTC holdings stood at US$1.2 billion.    <center>In April 2022 Tesla was second only to MicroStrategy in terms of public company Bitcoin holdings. Source </center>  In its Q1 2022 letter, Tesla remained resolute in its commitment to BTC. Writing to shareholders that the company believed in the “long-term potential of digital assets both as an investment and also as a liquid alternative to cash.” The heavy loss in value of Bitcoin in Q2 appears to have made this position untenable.  In early 2021, Tesla initially invested US$1.5 Billion into Bitcoin, the firm also changed its business policy and allowed customers to make payments in BTC. The reaction to Tesla’s Bitcoin buy had an immediate effect on markets. It was perceived as a bullish flag and a mainstream moment for crypto. The price of BTC immediately shot up as a result.  In the two days following February 8th 2021, the day Tesla announced the Bitcoin purchase, the price of BTC jumped from ~US$38,883 to ~US$46569 - a 20% jump in value.  In the last two days, the announcement that Tesla had sold a chunk of its Bitcoin has interrupted a short bitcoin bull run, with the Bitcoin price dropping from ~US$24,160 to ~US$22,822 a ~6% decline. However, markets also appear to have shaken off the bearish news quickly. The price of Bitcoin is already rising again and is back above US$23,000.    Source: @venturecoinist  The above chart posted by crypto price analyst Luke Martin compares the price reactions to Tesla initially buying BTC and Tesla selling 75% of its BTC positions. In both cases, there was an immediate reaction to the news, what was different in 2021 was the extended period of price momentum that continued for days after the event.  This time, Tesla’s move had much less impact on the Bitcoin price - a fact which has some observers excited. Pseudonymous crypto analyst @cryptoSqueeze, who has 116,700 twitter followers,  “BTC not dumping after Tesla news is probably the most bullish thing ever. When bad news can't tank the market, it can only go up”  Will Clemente,  “So Tesla has already sold off their inventory, appears to have mainly done so to maintain positive cash flow (non bitcoin-centric reasons), and still has 25% of their BTC. Maybe I’m coping but seems like a nothingburger.” Clemente is implying that Tesla sold out of its Bitcoin position for financial reasons and not because the company has lost faith in utility of the Bitcoin network.  In May 2021, Tesla stopped accepting BTC for payments with Musk explaining that the decision was driven by the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.  During the Q2 earnings call, Musk did mention Tesla may be open to increasing its Bitcoin holdings in the future. He said the decision to sell “should not be taken as some verdict against Bitcoin” and continued that ""we were concerned about overall liquidity for the company given [COVID-19] shutdowns in China."" This backs up the view that market observers had, that Tesla’s decisions were driven because of a short term need for cash, as opposed lack of faith in cryptocurrency (Musk also mentioned that Tesla did not sell any of its DOGE holdings).  That said, during the Q2 2022 earnings report investor Q&A, an anonymous institutional investor representing 10.8 Million TSLA shares asked Musk about the future of cryptocurrency, to which the eccentric billionaire's response was decidedly ‘meh’.  “Tesla’s goal is to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy,” he said. “Cryptocurrency is a sideshow to the sideshow. So, cryptocurrency is not something we think about a lot.” He finished by saying, “my primary motivation here is to have the day of sustainable energy come sooner. That’s our goal. We’re neither here nor there on cryptocurrency.”"

Tesla Unloaded BTC in Q2  On Tuesday, Tesla’s earnings report for the second quarter of 2022 was released. The report revealed that the company had converted most of its Bitcoin holdings into fiat currency, earning around $936 million in cash for its balance sheet under “proceeds from sales of digital assets.” The sold-off assets comprised 75% of the firm’s Bitcoin holdings, as it had purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoins in February 2021. However, it had sold off around $272 million of these holdings in the first quarter of 2021. After the most recent selloff, the company now holds around $218 million of Bitcoin.  Musk Claims Liquidity Concerns  Tesla CEO Elon Musk addressed the matter during an earnings call with analysts on Wednesday. He explained that the sell-off was not a “verdict on Bitcoin.” Instead, it resulted from liquidity concerns due to covid shutdowns in China. He is referring to the two-month-long COVID shutdown in Shanghai, where the Tesla Gigafactory was briefly closed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. On top of that, parts shortages and shipping disruptions also caused further delays in production and deliveries. As a result, Tesla’s operations fell short of their targets. However, Musk has also said that the company would be open to increasing its Bitcoin holdings in the future.  Tesla CFO Explains Sale  The earnings call also included Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn, who revealed that the sale was for “a realized gain,” which means that the company sold the crypto at a higher price than it purchased it. However, he also pointed out that the remaining Bitcoin in its holdings is worth much less than their buying price, indicating that the drop in the crypto’s prices has been significant enough to offset the profit from the 2022 Q2 sale. According to Kirkhorn, the actual net result was a $106 million cost to the company’s balance sheet.  Musk’s BTC Disillusionment  In early 2021, the car manufacturing company also announced that it would accept the premier crypto payment for Tesla cars. However, later in 2021, Musk announced that the company was holding off the BTC payment option due to its energy-intensive mining process. Since the Tesla brand is all about sustainability, the high energy consumption of Bitcoin mining posed a problem. The CEO also clarified that Tesla would reconsider opening up the payment option if Bitcoin could switch to a more sustainable model.

"181",1108,2022-07-21,"Bitcoin Magazine","For many people, Bitcoin is synonymous with freedom, decentralization, independence and the future. Some consider it akin to anarchy, an online revolution that began with the minting of the first block of Bitcoin that flipped the proverbial bird at central banks and government policy makers.  For governments, however, the vista is different. Generally speaking, those who govern others routinely perceive the cryptocurrency ecosphere as a lawless place, used to fund terrorism and other illicit activities, launder money and evade taxes.  In response to the trillions of dollars of investor and commercial interest, President Joe Biden calling on the government to examine the risks and benefits of cryptocurrencies. The executive order's explicit aim is to explore a U.S. central bank digital currency (CBDC), which would be a digital fiat, backed by the United States government. But if the original purpose behind the creation of cryptocurrency was to eliminate government control and oversight over fiat and monetary policy, how far will the U.S. government’s control over its citizens' digital currency extend?  The executive order says that the “principal policy objectives of the United States with respect to digital assets are as follows: We must protect consumers, investors, and businesses in the United States.” The policy goes on to articulate that digital assets have “profound implications” on “crime; national security; the ability to exercise human rights; financial inclusion and equity; and energy demand and climate change.” The executive order isolates the asset class as “non‑state issued digital assets.” Future regulatory, governance and technological measures will purportedly be designed to “counter illicit activities” and “enhance the efficacy of our national security tools.” While there’s no denying the dark side of cryptocurrency and its possible criminal uses, not only does the U.S. government want to regulate cryptocurrency, they seek to control it.  It appears a sure bet that the United States government will (1) regulate private cryptocurrency while (2) issuing its own government-controlled digital token. And in the context of the world's leading liberal democracy founded on a rule of law based on limitation of government powers, this development warrants serious scrutiny.  Going all the way back to the formation of the United States of America, the founding fathers were skeptical about giving banks and governments control over currencies. During the drafting of the U.S. Constitution, John Adams drew on the colonist’s distrust of government-issued money and  that every dollar of printed fiat money was “a cheat upon somebody.” The drafters left the federal government with only the power to “coin money,” and forbade the states from making anything but gold and silver coin legal ""tender.” Years later, in 1816,  that “banking establishments are more dangerous than standing armies... [and] the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity, under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale.”  The advent of Bitcoin appeared to be the antidote to the centuries-old problem identified by Jefferson. Bitcoin was specifically designed to obviate the need for a central bank or single administrator. In fact, Bitcoin does not need government support, or to be “backed” by gold and silver. Bitcoin was architected to comprise a store of value who’s value would be determined by the global population’s free market dynamics, via simply supply and demand arithmetic.  So why should any of this matter? At times, the U.S. government has historically suppressed the rights of Americans, and many Americans have shown that they are more than willing to give up those freedoms. It is only a matter of time before the United States issues a digital currency, and likely attempts to suppress, through whatever means, the value and utility of bitcoin, along with the rights of its citizens.  With a U.S.-issued digital coin, the government will have the technical capability, among other things, to limit and apply pressure on what Americans can purchase, to track and monitor citizens’ expenditures and place limits on the quantity or amount of products we purchase.  In extreme cases, the government could rescind or remove all CDBC funds from circulation or from a person’s control. That is already a reality in criminal cases, but here the concern is the ability and willingness of the government to use digital dollars to monitor and control even without the existence of criminal charges or a conviction. These concerns are not merely hypothetical. Last year the Canadian government ordered financial firms to  any transactions from 34 crypto wallets tied to funding trucker-led protests over COVID-19 vaccine mandates.  Examples in the United States are easy to conceptualize. If Congress believes that cutting down on gasoline would lower emissions enough to reverse climate change, they could put spending limits on the amount of gas one could purchase. Instead of raising taxes on cigarettes, the government could nullify all cigarette purchases made with digital dollars. While the ""in party"" will be temporarily satisfied at the expense of the ""out party,"" fortunes can change fast. Constitutional questions (which often take years to resolve) notwithstanding, where a Republican administration might ban the use of digital dollars to pay for Planned Parenthood services for example, a Democratic administration could just as easily ban the use of digital dollars to purchase guns or ammunition. The reality is that both political parties may well be tempted to utilize digital dollars to influence societal behavior and punish transgressors by restraining the ability to use the currency for travel, education and other essential life activities.  So, are we headed inexorably and at warp speed towards a future where, as George Orwell , “nothing was your own except the few cubic centimeters in your skull?"" Will the United States government utilize digital coins to create a social credit scoring system on par with China's? That depends. Not only on the government's actions, but on the vigilance of lawyers in private practice and civil libertarians more generally. Careful attention must be paid to any efforts by the government to utilize digital dollars for surveillance, control or unlawful restriction of individual privacy and liberty. Because, after all, if ""love of money is the root of all evil,"" then unconstrained U.S. government-issued digital dollars may turn into the ""mother of all evils.""

The cause will find and fund community-led carbon removal projects to help fight climate change and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The Carbon Removal cause joins The Chopra Foundation’s mental health and well-being cause, ‘Never Alone’, on EarthFund, with over $116,000 raised for the cause so far.  “We’re all incredibly excited for Dr Tweed to be launching her cause on our platform,” EarthFund CEO Adam Boalt said. “Not only is she going to be conducting research into carbon storage at Cambridge University, but through her cause on the EarthFund platform, she’s also going to be growing a global community that gets rewarded for being the driving force behind finding and funding carbon removal projects around the world.”  The Carbon Removal cause will fund projects that offer real and meaningful action on the rising global temperatures with a special focus on funding nature-based initiatives that reduce the carbon footprint in the short and long term.  “Individual action is crucially important. Recycling, flying less, voting for progressive candidates, and eating less meat... are all great. But to accelerate climate action we need to come together to create scalable models for broader systemic change. This is no secret,” said Dr Tweed on the launch of “Carbon Removal on EarthFund.  Carbon Removal DAO: A collective pull towards fighting climate change  Over the past few years, the world has been working on a common goal to reduce the carbon footprint around the globe. While green technology and reducing the use of fossil fuels are viewed as long-term solutions, Dr Tweed believes nature-based solutions and collaborative efforts toward fighting climate change could lead to the goal faster.  “The problem is that there hasn’t been a tool for collective, meaningful, and coordinated global action until now,” Dr Tweed said. “The Carbon Removal cause is an accessible and inclusive community where people can come together as a collective to support sustainable community-led carbon removal projects and bring about real change.”  The Carbon Removal DAO, led by Dr Lucy Tweed, will be able to raise funds from the community and let the community propose and vote on projects they would wish to see funded. Unlike the current drives towards fighting climate change, which is becoming more about PR than actual action, the DAO will promote community-led causes, which make a real change for humanity. Additionally, Carbon Removal DAO will also ensure that the nature-based initiatives work with the local communities and ecology, offering the best-suited ways to fight climate change without disregarding the local people.  “The Carbon Removal DAO is set up to support communities around the world to reclaim sovereignty of their land by funding nature-based carbon removal projects that put local livelihoods and environmental justice front and centre,” Dr Tweed.  Furthermore, the DAO will aim to help global communities come together to fund various approaches to fighting climate change, including protecting carbon-rich ecosystems, restoring ecosystems, regenerative agriculture, and piloting new approaches to carbon removal.  Following the launch of the Carbon Removal DAO, EarthFund will drop the CarbonCommons tokens to its community members. The holders of the Carbon Commons token can use it to vote on projects and proposals and in turn get rewarded in USDT for participating in governance. However, the token will not be tradable in secondary markets and exchanges, users can swap it for 1Earth (EarthFund’s native token) on their official website.

"186",1727,2022-07-19,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Kudzai Kutukwa, a passionate financial inclusion advocate who was recognized by Fast Company magazine as one of South Africa’s top-20 young entrepreneurs under 30.  The release of the Bitcoin white paper in 2009 after the 2008 financial crisis was one the most significant events of the 21st century. For the first time ever, a trustless, peer-to-peer monetary system for the digital age that was independent of intermediaries and central banks was now a reality.  Initially, Bitcoin was dismissed as a passing fad and a worthless Ponzi scheme, but 13 years later, no one is laughing at Bitcoin anymore. In fact, it’s now being ruthlessly attacked in multiple ways. These attacks have included 2021’s ban of Chinese bitcoin miners by the Chinese government; the continual denial of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); the framing of Bitcoin as an environmental hazard (which later prompted the EU to consider banning proof-of-work mining); and, most recently, the EU’s attack on “unhosted wallets.” The latter is not just an attempt at the regulatory capture of Bitcoin, but it’s also an attack on your financial privacy. You can think of it as the 21st-century version of .  Financial regulators around the world have been slowly turning up the heat and cracking down on the use of unhosted wallets, but before we proceed any further, we need to address the elephant in the room, which is the term “unhosted wallet.” What on Earth is an unhosted wallet anyway? It’s simply a noncustodial wallet (aka self-custody wallet) where the user owns the private keys and is 100% in control of their money as opposed to handing it over to a third party for “safekeeping.” A simple example of an unhosted wallet would be your physical wallet or purse which isn’t tied to any financial institution, holds as much cash as you want to put into it and is 100% under your control. What makes this term even more bizarre and dangerous is that it implies that our personal financial data has to be “hosted” on someone else’s server. The implication being that self-custody is dangerous, suspicious and wrong.  Introducing the term “unhosted wallet” is a subtle but effective attack meant to maintain the role of “trusted third parties” that Bitcoin was created to replace. It makes absolutely no sense for a permissionless and trustless system to require the green light from gatekeepers before it can be accessed.  Der Gigi expressed this idea perfectly when , “The discussion shouldn’t be about ‘hosting’ in the first place. It should be about control. Who can access your funds? Who can freeze your account? Who is the master, and who is the slave? Just like ‘the cloud is someone else’s computer,’ a ‘hosted wallet’ is someone else’s wallet.”  There is no Bitcoin without self-custody, just IOUs from centralized exchanges. This is why “not your keys, not your coins” is more than just a catchphrase, but a reminder to remain financially sovereign.  Since Bitcoin is censorship resistant and cannot be effectively banned, the choke points that are now being exploited are the on-ramps and off-ramps into and out of the cash system. Given the fact that the average person is likely to acquire bitcoin from a centralized exchange, know your customer rules are then put into play with the intention of attaching a government ID and physical address to a “Bitcoin address.” The end goal being a state where every transaction is tied to an identity that leaves an audit trail for the authorities, through which they can easily conduct financial surveillance and exert control like they already do in the fiat system. Furthermore, your personal data is at risk from data leaks and hackers should the exchange get compromised, as is  with centralized databases. A recent example of this would be the  of the Shanghai Police Department’s database that resulted in the theft of one billion people’s personal data. Your bitcoin and personal safety are at risk should this happen to a centralized exchange where you have a hosted wallet. This is why the use of misnomers such as “unhosted wallet” should be seen for what it is: regulatory capture.  This attack was switched into gear in October 2021, when the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), in their “ ,” specified that transactions between unhosted wallets pose specific money laundering and terrorist financing risks and that, under certain situations, some transactions between unhosted wallets fall under the . In March 2022, regulators in Canada, Japan and Singapore  centralized exchanges should collect personal data, such as names and physical addresses of owners of unhosted wallets that receive or send bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to the customers of these exchanges. These requirements were implemented in Canada soon after the government had  and even “hosted wallets” of the truckers who were protesting against COVID-19 mandates. Similar rules to those implemented by Canada, Japan and Singapore  in the Netherlands on June 27, 2022.  Not to be outdone in this statist overreach, the European parliament reached a  on their cryptocurrency bill, dubbed “Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA),” which aims to regulate and place “unhosted wallets” under financial surveillance. According to a statement released by the parliament in a  :  “Transfers of crypto-assets will be traced and identified to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, and other crimes, says the new legislation agreed on Wednesday. … The rules would also cover transactions from so-called un-hosted wallets (a crypto-asset wallet address that is in the custody of a private user) when they interact with hosted wallets managed by CASPs [Crypto Asset Service Providers].”  Ernest Urtasun, a member of the European Parliament, posted a celebratory  outlining some of the key aspects of the bill that “will put an end to the wild west of unregulated crypto.” According to one of  in this thread, the new regulations will mandate centralized exchanges to unmask the identity of the owner of an unhosted wallet before “large” amounts of crypto are sent to them — by large, they mean €1,000 or more. In a subsequent statement, he hailed the new regulations as being the right remedy for fighting money laundering and reducing fraud.  The irony of the matter is despite their “good intentions” in seeking to curb money laundering, an estimated 2–5% of global GDP ($1.7 trillion to $4.2 trillion) is laundered globally, mostly via the traditional banking system . More money is laundered annually through the banking system than the entire market cap ($1 trillion at the time of publication) of all cryptocurrencies combined. It gets worse: The impact of anti-money laundering laws (AML) on  — meaning criminals have a 99.95% success rate in laundering money — and compliance costs exceed the value of confiscated illicit funds a hundred times over. Real criminals get a free pass while financial institutions and the average law-abiding citizen are penalized. According to the , AML laws are totally ineffective in stopping the flow of ill-gotten gains. Between 2010 and 2014, a paltry 1.1% of criminal profits were seized in the EU,  by Europol. No wonder AML laws have  the most ineffective anti-crime measures anywhere! Yet, the bigger problem seems to be unhosted wallets and the “wild west of unregulated crypto.” Talk about misplaced priorities.  (  )  Despite the obvious failures of AML in the traditional financial system, lawmakers and regulators still insist on targeting unhosted wallets with burdensome and impractical regulations. Not only will MiCA stifle innovation within the EU, it’s also going to result in capital flight to more Bitcoin-friendly jurisdictions like El Salvador. One would be forgiven for speculating that laws like MiCA are a slow creep toward the outright ban of self-custody wallets and are forerunners that will pave the way for the introduction of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs): a more Orwellian form of money. The architecture of hosted wallets and that of CBDCs are similar in that they are both centralized, they are subject to financial surveillance, and they are under the control of a third party.  In a world where digital payments are the rule and not the exception, it is critical to have payment systems and tools that are sufficiently decentralized and efficient in order to maintain the protection of privacy. The importance of having financial privacy was summarized perfectly in Eric Hughes’ “  ”:  “Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world … Therefore, privacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Until now, cash has been the primary such system. An anonymous transaction system is not a secret transaction system. An anonymous system empowers individuals to reveal their identity when desired and only when desired; this is the essence of privacy.”  These words still ring true today. Once your identity is paired to a wallet, your privacy is compromised and it becomes easier to track all your on-chain transactions forever. If you don’t control how much you can have or where you can store it, you don’t own your money. Whoever controls your money controls you. Centralized financial systems — of which hosted wallets are a part — are every authoritarian’s dream and are designed to grant the power of financial omniscience to the state. Bitcoin was designed to empower the individual through the separation of money and state. Self-custody wallets are integral in preserving that.  This is a guest post by Kudzai Kutukwa.

"187",2174,2022-07-19,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Vishvas Garg, a Ph.D. in pharmacoeconomics, epidemiology, pharmaceutical policy and outcomes research from the University of New Mexico.  In a previous article, I introduced . In this article, I discuss the details of my proposal by using a case example of the private insurance market in the United States. First, I describe the unmet needs in this private insurance market. Then, I discuss the idea of a new bitcoin-enabled, patient-centric health plan structured as a public good and a new electronic health-record system where patients own their data. The Bitcoin network creates an opportunity for patient-centric healthcare.  Patient’s Taking Back Their Data  Of the total data generated in the world, 30% is in healthcare. This data, including the patient’s own medical records, is owned by institutions. This healthcare data sit in silos in disparate health systems, making it difficult to access even by researchers for advancing research and development efforts in healthcare. In any patient-centric healthcare system, patients will own their data.  A Bitcoin-enabled innovative solution can deliver high-quality, equitable, patient-centric healthcare in an affordable manner to millions of Americans.  Satoshi Nakamoto wrote in the , “Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments.”  Insurance providers are financial institutions as well. I believe we can build a new integrated healthcare system that can deliver high-quality, equitable, patient-centric healthcare in an affordable manner.  The purpose of this Bitcoin-based innovative solution should be health empowerment.  We can start building this new system by developing a new electronic health-record (EHR) system based in Web5 and a Bitcoin-enabled health insurance product.  A New EHR System  Healthcare is the practice of data-driven science. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  the factors that influence health into: genetics, behavior, environmental and physical influences, medical care and social.  A traditional  such as administrative and billing data, patient demographics, medical histories, medications, labs, etc. Most of this information is only a part of the factors that influence health.  Instead, a new EHR system can be designed to capture data on all factors that influence health. For instance, data can be captured via the healthcare providers, patients, caregivers, wearable devices, travel and food apps. Health can be entered by various parties including the patients, caregivers, wearable devices and the various types of apps such as for diet, weight management, travel, women’s health, etc.  This EHR system will be based in , which is a decentralized web platform that uses bitcoin to revolutionize the commerce of the internet. Within Web5, the decentralized identifiers (DIDs) built on Bitcoin (e.g., via ION) can empower the patients to own their digital identity and . The decentralized web nodes (DWNs) in Web5 can be the new standard for storing the health data and relaying that data enables entities of any type (patients, providers, etc.) to send and store HIPAA-compliant messages and information.  Through , developers can build applications that can transcend the current document-based environment and enable access to data no matter what EHR operating system underpins the user’s infrastructure. This also means that the existing EHRs of the patients can be used as a foundation for the proposed system, hence significantly lowering the barrier to entry.  The main benefits of such a new EHR system are:  * Patient-centric healthcare system: Patients should own their data in any patient-centric healthcare system.  * Seamless patient care: A patient having the ability to seamlessly share their data with any healthcare provider of their choice will ensure continuity of care.  * Data on all determinants of health will drive higher-quality care: Having access to data on all factors that influence health can help enable and improve the quality of evidence-based medicine for each patient.  * Acceleration of development of new health technologies: Value-add services can be built atop this EHR system to promote research efforts for innovative, life-changing health technologies. The purpose of such services should always be to maximize patients’ health and optimize system efficiencies. Such services can also create new revenue streams for the key participating stakeholders.  * Waste reduction: Overall,  that about 25% of healthcare spending in the U.S. is wasted. Data-driven, value-add services can drive waste reduction by increasing system efficiency and cutting fraud and abuse.  A New Bitcoin-Enabled Health Plan  This health plan will have the following key characteristics:  * Operate as a public good: Like the internet, this insurance will operate as a public good making no profit. This public-good nature will make this the only plan available that will stand to benefit from driving the total cost of healthcare down versus up. This is because any savings will be directly passed on to the sponsors, which will make the plan more affordable. The more affordable the plan becomes, the stronger its value proposition is for expansion.  * Anyone who has access to the internet can enroll: This will allow the beneficiaries to be seen at a healthcare practice of their choice. This is important because not all healthcare practices will see uninsured patients or even take all health insurances. In this health plan, anyone can sponsor coverage for themselves or anyone else.  * Coverage and payments: Preventive care should be highly proactive and always offered without any out-of-pocket costs. The level of coverage for other healthcare services can be customized per the sponsor’s choice. Fairer credit products like “buy now, pay later” can be offered to help patients budget for the out-of-pocket portion of such healthcare expenses. Sponsors may also purchase a stop-loss coverage for larger health bills.  * The system will strongly encourage and reward evidence-based medicine (EBM). EBM is using the best research for making healthcare decisions. EBM can be strongly encouraged and rewarded on both the healthcare provider (HCP) and patient levels.  * Preventive care and early intervention. Practicing EBM will strongly encourage proactive and preventive care, which is always the best option for healthcare. After preventive care, the second-best option to maximize health is always early intervention. The system should also strongly promote EBM-based early intervention.  The network is the strongest protection for any insurance system. The bigger the network, the easier it is to distribute the risk of health-related expenditures among the entire base of enrollees. As the patient and provider networks of the proposed health plan grow, many synergies and innovations can be realized such as stronger bargaining power with providers and economies of scale in operating expenses. Through preventive care and early intervention, the population will become healthier, translating into lower total cost of care and, consequently, lowering the cost of health plans. All of this can help build an unparalleled affordable, high-quality and equitable health plan for millions of Americans.  Hypothetical Example Of The Bitcoin Health Plan  As displayed in the figure below, this health plan can be designed as a self-funded or level-funded insurance product. In this insurance type, the sponsors are eligible to receive back or roll over the unused premium contributions made by them. This creates a financial incentive to keep the sponsored persons healthy. The sponsor can also  the benefits design.  (Graphic/Vishvas Garg)  Currently,  are in a self-funded plan in the U.S. However, at small firms (three -199 workers) only 21% are in a self-funded plan versus 82% at large firms (200+ workers). Even the large, self-insured employers — where the workers are covered through a self-funded plan —  to effectively negotiate high hospital prices.  Level-funded plans are a newer hybrid option where the firms — usually small and mid-sized — can take advantage of a comparatively nominal, self-funded option while attaching a stop-loss coverage for high medical expenses.  Irrespective of the firm size, the current self-funded or level-funded plans do not meet the needs of the current employers. The cost of healthcare insurance has gone up every single year for at least the last two decades. In fact, after payroll, health insurance is the second biggest employee-related expense for an employer, with an average health plan costing  for family coverage in 2021. Hence, lowering the insurance costs can not only enable more employers to afford health insurance, but can also increase the competitiveness of the businesses.  85% of the collected premiums can be allocated towards paying medical bills and improving quality of care. The latter can include bitcoin rewards to patients for continuously improving their health and to healthcare providers for delivering high-quality care. The remaining 15% of premiums can be used for operating expenses and investing in bitcoin mining.  The 85/15% assumption can be varied to optimize the plan design. The same is currently based on the  for traditional fully insured plans through which millions of Americans currently get health coverage.  The key characteristics of the health plan proposed in the previous section will drive long-term savings. Examples of medical care and quality improvements:  * EBM: In the near term, 10% savings is likely achievable, while greater savings can be expected in the long term. As an example, a platform that enables EBM in Medicare Advantage plans has demonstrated .  * Bargaining power:  suggests that increasing market concentration of both insurance providers and hospitals in any given market is associated with more bargaining power.  * Reducing waste: , if even 20-40% of this total waste can be eliminated, it will translate into 5-10% savings.  The remaining 15% of premiums paid can be allocated as follows:  * Operating expenses: Running the health plan as a public good will incur operating expenses. I assume these to be at around 10%, but this number can be lower or higher. To operate in an asset-lite model,  can be leveraged. The TPAs can process or adjudicate claims, collect premiums, contract for healthcare services, provide utilization review of claims and similar ancillary services to the operation of the benefit plan.  * Bitcoin mining: The remaining amount from the premiums paid can be invested into bitcoin mining. This will have two benefits: It will strengthen the security of the Bitcoin network and the mining rewards can be used as a unique revenue stream to supplement the growth of the insurance network through offering referral bonuses and more.  Biometric screenings can be leveraged to establish person-specific goals for health and wellness promotions with bitcoin rewards. In 2021, 26% of small firms and 38% of large firms  for biometrics screening to their workers. Using these person-specific goals, bitcoin rewards can be offered for quality improvement purposes to incentivize those who continue to improve their health and wellbeing. The beneficiaries can apply these rewards against future healthcare expenditures.  Similarly, rewards for providers can be built for improving quality. As an example, established metrics such as the  used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can be used to define high-quality care.  Value-Added Services  Value-added services are the most dynamic part of this proposal. As the network grows, more innovative services can be built to maximize the participants’ health and optimize the system’s efficiency. Some examples are services for improving quality, accelerating research and development, optimizing system efficiency and lowering the enormous administrative burden.  Role Of Bitcoin  Bitcoin will play many roles in this proposal. Some key examples are:  * Making healthcare delivery patient-centric by enabling decentralized identity and giving ownership of the data back to the patients.  * Improving quality of care and reducing healthcare costs through enabling EBM and offering rewards to patients for improving health and to providers for improving quality of care.  * Supporting growth of the plan network through rewards from bitcoin mining.  * A superior payment mechanism that is desperately needed in healthcare. For instance, bitcoin can provide instant settlement versus the current time (often 30-plus days) it takes to process medical claims. This will not only reduce the revenue cycle for the healthcare providers but could also help lower the rate of claims denials.  In conclusion, my proposal is only the first draft. I invite input, feedback and partnership for refinement, development or execution from anyone who would like to contribute in delivering high-quality, equitable, patient-centric healthcare to millions of Americans in an affordable manner. I hope we can work together to one day make high-quality, equitable healthcare affordable for everyone.  This is a guest post by Vishvas Garg.

The startup combines cryptocurrencies with carbon credits to create tokens that can be burned when an owner wants to offset emissions. The token is known as the Goddess Nature Token (GNT).  FlowCarbon offers tokenized carbon credits to firms seeking to lower their carbon footprint. The credits can then be trading exchanges on crypto exchanges.  According to FlowCarbo n, these credits are traded until they are redeemed by the user, who can then claim the offset's environmental impact. The company said the token could be sold or redeemed for an underlying real-world credit.  Carbon markets are exceedingly opaque, and providing carbon credits can increase revenue and enhance transparency for buyers. Besides FlowCarbon, several venture capitalists such as OffsetFarm, JustCarbon, and Carbon Interface are also hinting toward the carbon credit market as they consider carbon credits a credible revenue source for projects.  Flowcarbon raised $70 million in a funding round led by a16z, Andreessen Horowitz's crypto arm, in May. Other investors participated in the funding round, including General Catalyst, Samsung Next, RSE Ventures, and Allegory Labs.  Weak Market Conditions  The news by Flowcarbon follows other tokens' launch delays.

The SEC is now left with just four members: Mr. Gensler, Democrat Caroline Crenshaw, Republican Hester Peirce, and Republican Mark T. Uyeda.  The commission normally operates with five members. President Biden will need to nominate another Democrat to fill an open seat vacated by Lee.  Lee has been a vocal proponent of the SEC mandating climate-related disclosures for public companies as well as investment firms, broker-dealers, and investment advisers. She also argued in favor of enhanced disclosures concerning other environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters and political contributions.  Lee recently supported a proposed rule for enhanced disclosures for private equity and hedge funds. She also recently encouraged the SEC to create a better system to hold securities lawyers accountable for providing bad advice to their public company clients.  In her public remarks, Lee expressed skepticism surrounding the crypto market. In March, she said digital assets mostly defy existing regulations and laws."

The date was suggested by Tim Beiko, the lead organizer of core developers at the Ethereum Foundation a Consensus Layer call held this past Thursday. Although no objection to the date was raised, Beiko opined that it is still a tentative date and is subject to adjustment if the need arises.

The PoW has a couple of criticism including the quantity of energy harnessed by the system and its effect on the environment.  is a transition of the ETH Proof-of-Work to a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model. It is currently getting tested on a few public testnet before finally moving to the ETH Mainnet.  Twitter user, Superphiz.eth, one of the developers attested to the fact that Beiko's suggestion is not concluding but only a roadmap. He took to his Twitter page to encourage observers to look out for the official announcement.  Per his tweet;  This merge timeline isn't final, but it's extremely exciting to see it coming together. Please regard this as a planning timeline and look out for official announcements!  In the few weeks left before the Merge, large amounts of carbon will still be emitted into the atmosphere and will cause consequential damage to the environment.  According to another developer Ben Edgington, There are very real costs associated with not doing the merge: 130,000 tons of carbon dioxide every day, It's nearly a million tons a week. Every week we twiddle our thumbs, that's a megaton of carbon dioxide we re emitting.  What Happens After The Merge?  After the transition is finalized, the newly installed PoS consensus mechanism will reduce the number of carbon emissions up to 99% by slashing the blockchain energy consumption during mining.  Also, the ETH scaling solution will experience an upgrade that will likely involve Sharding, a type of database partitioning into smaller and faster pieces. With the PoS,  on security, sustainability, and scalability.  It is worthy of note that the upscaling to the PoS consensus will not immediately mean a reduction in the transaction gas fee. It is not an increase in network capacity but only a transition in the consensus mechanism. Also, staked withdrawal is yet to be enabled with the Merge. Therefore, withdrawals might not be possible immediately after the Merge until the Shanghai upgrade which comes after the Merge."

The funds raised this time will be used to recruit more professionals and expand the current start-up team of about 100 people. It will also make preparations for the subsequent expansion of 5ire's business into Asia, North America and Europe.  In a statement, Cofounder Gauri said that: We are on a mission to embed sustainability into blockchain and shift the current paradigm from for-profit' to for-benefit'.  Upon completion of this financing, 5ire will be valued at $1.5 billion, becoming the first blockchain unicorn with sustainability at its core.  Founded by Indian entrepreneurs Pratik Gauri and Prateek Dwivedi last August, 5ire is a blockchain network that brings sustainability, technology, and Innovation to build the 5th industrial revolution (5IR).  In October last year, it received a total of $21 million in seed round financing from Marshland Capital, Launchpool Labs, Moonrock Capital, and other companies at a valuation of $110 million. The project has now attracted a total of $121 million in investment.  5ire's unique ""Sustainable Proof-of-Stake Consensus Protocol"" is committed to advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goals.  ""The secret sauce of our idea is to not use Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Work but instead reward sustainable behaviour by using Proof-of-Benefit,"" Gauri said.  5ire will also empower Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to help accelerate the implementation of the United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals."
"193",912,2022-07-18,"Brave New Coin","Kalima blockchain, has developed a dedicated IoT blockchain solution for industrial companies and asset owners, which is ready to be deployed at a global scale. Kalima, a 3rd generation blockchain, offers a new way to independently and securely collect, manage and monetize enterprise data.  McKinsey estimates the potential economic impact of IoT applications to be as high as $11.1 trillion per year in 2025, and the E.U. Commission stated that 80% of the industrial data currently generated within the EU is never used (representing €270 billion). To Kalima, this gap is explained by the fact that current data management solutions lack many important aspects, including end-to-end data management and monetization.  After 10 years of development, Kalima Blockchain is ready for global scaling and thus is launching an Initial Coin Offering to introduce the KLX, its native token designed to monetize enterprise data including data coming from IoT devices. Currently at the private sale stage, the public sale will take place in Q3 this year. Initially, up until the end of 2023, the KLX will be an ERC-20 compatible token after which it will be bridged to a native token in the Kalima MainChain.  In this regard, the KLX will have multi-purpose in manoeuvering within the Kalima ecosystem. The main uses are detailed below:  * KLX is a utility token and the basic accounting unit used to build on the Kalima ecosystem. Its first function is to pay transaction fees on Kalima Blockchain ecosystems.  * The Kalima blockchain is a decentralized ecosystem composed of the Kalima MainChain, enterprise-private and industry-public blockchains, dubbed “PrivaChains”. KLX will allow users, businesses and developers, to obtain their own PrivaChain and to create decentralized applications (Dapps).  * The monetization of any data can notably be done utilizing KLX tokens with integrated decentralized oracle networks. Oracles connect real world data to the Kalima Blockchain, through which businesses can monetize all or part of their data such as carbon footprint or ESG data.  * KLX tokens can be used to acquire Validation nodes and Master nodes, which are both in charge of securing the network. KLX token will be used for validator remuneration.  * Every holder possessing over 0,2% of KLX in circulation can create their own staking pool to become a validator and obtain the rewards associated with securing the network.  * Any user can contribute to the successful running of the network by staking their KLX tokens. In other words, KLX holders can delegate their tokens to a validator’s staking pool for a period of time, and earn rewards in proportion to their contribution to that staking pool.  * KLX owners will have the possibility to sell their tokens on decentralized exchanges, soon followed by centralized ones.  Kalima's blockchain is built to handle very large amounts of sensitive data generated by industries collecting data via IoT sensors and analyzing that data in real-time. The PrivaChains can be linked to one another or to other leading public chains (Tezos, Lightning, Polygon, and Cosmos hubs), boosting Kalima's industrial adoption.  The European Commission said, “80% of all data is expected to be processed in smart devices closer to the user, known as edge computing in 2025.” With Kalima Blockchain embedded into IoT devices (gateways) and in mobiles, Kalima client side smart contracts can process this data at the edge creating value that can be collected at oracle’s level. Oracles can be managed by PrivaChain owners or by partners through solution like Chainlink Oracles.  Stephane Dejean, CMO of Kerlink, who is an early member of the Kalima blockchain said, “While the Helium blockchain is used to reward contributors for providing hotspots to power The People's Network, the Kalima blockchain is used in a different manner. IoT sensors will offer real-time, trustworthy, and genuine data on this blockchain, which will benefit smart contracts first.”  With the recent development of new reporting frameworks within the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings, businesses are required to openly disclose their data on sustainability commitments, ethical operations, and social practices, making ESG data collection, management and analysis a multi-industry use case. Kalima’s objective for the near future is to focus on providing qualified and traceable data for ESG ratings, reporting, and ESG data monetization.  About Kalima   consists of both a Kalima MainChain and a network of decentralized blockchains known as Kalima PrivaChains. It provides an interconnected blockchain concept as a new paradigm for solving the decentralization objective and increasing scalability, adopting a paramount feature from blockchains such as Cosmos and Polkadot. PrivaChains allow users to independently own, govern and manage their blockchain and the data stored on it, notably through dapps, all the while maintaining data confidentiality.  As the company reaches its 10th anniversary, and after partnerships with several industrial companies such as SPIE, Kerlink (prominent IoT gateway provider), Kenza DAO, Tezos and more, Kalima has decided to launch its ICO (Initial Coin Offering) in order to fully establish itself as a blockchain industrial company, and to raise their operations to new heights.

"194",1057,2022-07-17,"Cryptonews.com","Tom Boellstorff, Professor of Anthropology, the University of California, Irvine.  _____  Quick, define the word “metaverse.”  Coined in 1992 , the relatively obscure term , particularly after Facebook rebranded as Meta in October 2021. There are now myriad articles on the metaverse, and  of companies have invested in its development. Citigroup Inc. has estimated that by 2030 the metaverse , with 5bn users.  From climate change to global connection and disability access to pandemic response, the metaverse has incredible potential. Gatherings in virtual worlds have considerably lower carbon footprints than in-person gatherings. People spread all over the globe can gather together in virtual spaces. The metaverse can allow disabled people . And during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the metaverse not only  but also served as a place where, for instance, those sharing a small apartment could be alone.  No less , from surveillance and exploitation to disinformation and discrimination.  But discussing these benefits and threats remains difficult because of confusion about what “metaverse” actually means. As a  who has been researching the metaverse for almost 20 years, I know this confusion matters. The metaverse is at a virtual crossroads. Norms and standards set in the next few years are likely to structure the metaverse for decades. But without common conceptual ground, people cannot even debate these norms and standards.  Unable to distinguish innovation from hype, people can do little more than talk past one another. This leaves powerful companies like Meta to literally set the terms for their own commercial interests. For example, Nick Clegg, former deputy prime minister of the UK and now president of global affairs at Meta, attempted to control the narrative with the May 2022 essay “ .”  Categorical prototypes  Most attempted definitions for metaverse include a bewildering laundry list of technologies and principles, but always included are virtual worlds – places online where real people interact in real time. Thousands of virtual worlds already exist, some gaming oriented, like  and , others more open-ended, like  and .  Beyond virtual worlds, the list of metaverse technologies typically includes avatars, nonplayer characters and bots; virtual reality; cryptocurrency, blockchain and non-fungible tokens; social networks from Facebook and Twitter to Discord and Slack; and mobile devices like phones and augmented reality interfaces. Often included as well are principles like interoperability – the idea that identities, friendship networks and digital items like avatar clothes .  The problem is that humans don’t categorize by laundry lists. Instead, decades of research in cognitive science has shown that . One could define “bird” in terms of a laundry list of traits: has wings, flies and so on. But the prototypical bird for North Americans looks something like a sparrow. Hummingbirds and ducks are further from this prototype. Further still are flamingos and penguins. Yet all are birds, radiating out from the socially specific prototype. Someone living near the Antarctic might place penguins closer to the center.  Human creations are usually radial categories as well. If asked to draw a chair, few people would draw a dentist chair or beanbag chair.  The metaverse is a human creation, and the most important step to defining it is to realize it’s a radial category. Virtual worlds are prototypical for the metaverse. Other elements of the laundry list radiate outward and won’t appear in all cases. And what’s involved will be socially specific. It will look different in Alaska than it will in Addis Ababa, or when at work versus at a family gathering.  Whose idea of essential?  This matters because one of the most insidious rhetorical moves currently underway is to assert that some optional aspect of the metaverse is prototypical. For instance, many pundits define the metaverse as  and cryptocurrencies. But many existing virtual worlds use means other than blockchain for confirming ownership of digital assets. Many use national currencies like the US dollar, or metaverse currencies pegged to a national currency.  Another such rhetorical move appears when Clegg uses an  with a foundation and two floors to argue not only that interoperability will be part of “the foundations of the building” but that it’s “the common theme across these floors.”  But Clegg’s warning that “without a significant degree of interoperability baked into each floor, the metaverse will become fragmented” ignores how interoperability isn’t prototypical for the metaverse. In many cases, fragmentation is desirable. I might not want the same identity in two different virtual worlds, or on Facebook and an online game.  This raises the question of why Meta – and many pundits – are fixated on interoperability. Left unsaid in Clegg’s essay is the “foundation” of Meta’s profit model: tracking users across the metaverse to  with maximum effectiveness. Recognizing “metaverse” as a radial category reveals that Clegg’s claim about interoperability isn’t a statement of fact. It’s an attempt to render Meta’s  prototypical, the foundation of the metaverse. It doesn’t have to be.  Locking in definitions  This example illustrates how defining the metaverse isn’t an empty intellectual exercise. It’s the conceptual work that will fundamentally shape design, policy, profit, community and the digital future.  Clegg’s essay concludes optimistically that “time is on our side” because many metaverse technologies won’t be fully realized for a decade or more. But , when definitions about digital technology get locked in they become difficult to dislodge. They become digital common sense.  With regard to the definitions that will be the true foundation of the metaverse, time is emphatically not on our side. I believe that now is the time to debate how the metaverse will be defined — because these definitions are very likely to become our digital realities.

"195",573,2022-07-17,"CryptoDaily","The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has yet to show signs of a full recovery. However, the weekly timeframes for the crypto king demonstrate a possibly weakening bearish sentiment. A few known cryptos like Cronos (CRO) and Chainlink (LINK) are also gaining momentum, including a newcomer that shows promise of price gains and long-term asset appreciation.  Uniglo (GLO)  Uniglo is a new social currency project and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) protocol designed to empower its community. Its tokenization involves an ultra-deflationary model with two parts–a standard burning model and an Ultra-Burn Mechanism.  The Uniglo protocol has a digital asset vault that will contain digital currencies, NFTs, digitized gold, and real-world collectibles. As such, it is attracting prospective investors who want their portfolio to consist of tokens and assets that help counter volatility and can hold their position in a bear market  The first presale period of Uniglo runs from the 15th of July until the 15th of August.  Bitcoin (BTC)  As the most ubiquitous crypto in the world, Bitcoin has been severely affected by the general economy and external environmental factors. It has struggled for many weeks, with its price falling below $20,000.  During the previous week, however, the price of BTC went over $21,000, which could be a sign that the bearish momentum is waning. While the price could still fall further in the coming weeks, CoinShares Chief Strategy Officer Meltem Demirors says BTC could reach new all-time highs within the next two years.  Cronos (CRO)  Developed by Crypto.com, Cronos (CRO) is an Ethermint-based blockchain that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications. The price of its utility token, CRO, entered an all-time low in June, which equated to a drop of 89% from an all-time high price.  However, Cronos offers a lot to the market. Staking, crypto buying and selling, and financial trading tools are just some of its applications. As such, it has a growing community that will support the growth of its token.  Chainlink (LINK)  Chainlink is an oracle network that powers hybrid smart contracts. It notably supports the transfer of tamper-proof data from outside sources. Similar to Bitcoin and Cronos, the price of Chainlink’s token, LINK, is also struggling in the bearish market. During the past weeks, its token price decreased by 84% from its November all-time high. The network’s total value secured (TVL) also dropped from $60 billion to $14.3 billion.  But because of its market position as a Web3 oracle services provider, Chainlink’s user count continues to grow and shows promise of recovery.  Final takeaway  The prices of major coins and tokens continue to suffer as the general economy faces a possible recession. Though there is hope that the bearish momentum is slowing down, investors should look to new crypto gems that could bring more gains in the coming months than established cryptos.

The company with a $1.5 billion valuation has suddenly emerged as the latest addition to the Unicorns in India.  Notably, Alphabit, Marshland Capital, Launchpool Labs, and Moonrock Capital, four well-known startup investors, each committed $21 million to a seed round.  Well, with this news, it might look like the Indian crypto sector is booming. However, this doesn’t seem to be the case, at least not in the last couple of months.  Reportedly, India’s biggest digital asset exchanges are preparing for a protracted crypto winter that may include some unfavorable local twists. Exchanges, including Binance-backed WazirX, have put expansion plans on hold as a result of the current crypto market conditions, the inability of consumers to move money to their accounts, and the impending introduction of a dreaded transaction tax on cryptocurrencies.  What does crypto market look like then?  As per Google Trends analysis of the past 90 days of search data, the 2022 Union Budget declaration of the 30% tax on revenue from cryptocurrencies and other virtual digital assets appears to have had a detrimental impact on the interest of Indian retail investors.  Furthermore, on 1 February 2022, searches for the term “Cryptocurrency” reached an all-time high, with a reading of 100. Since then, most days have seen values between 17 and nine.  The reason for this happens to be that the Indian government treats cryptocurrencies differently from equities and bonds by forbidding the offsetting of trading losses.  Additionally, the fact that crypto exchanges have been mostly shut off from the conventional financial system since mid-April adds to the misery of the Indian investors.  The current scenario of the market happens to be quite different from 2021 when India was one of the thriving markets for cryptocurrencies. That being said, , the country’s cryptocurrency market grew by more than 600% in the 12 months leading up to June 2021.  Where does 5ire fit then?  As per a  dated 8 December 2021, 5ire plans to replace the current mechanism with the SPoS, or Sustainable Proof of Stake consensus algorithm that provides high levels of security and efficiency never attained by neither PoW nor PoS. Furthermore, the organization plans to expand its base across America, Asia, and Europe.  Thus, despite an unfavorable Indian cryptocurrency market at the given moment, companies like 5ire are building a more democratic and impactful system that has sustainability and long-term benefits for the planet."

"201",1888,2022-07-15,"Bitcoin Magazine","A Decision-Making Framework For Bitcoin Miners — What Various Whatsminer Models Tell Us  The bitcoin mining space is rife with anecdotes, best practices and old wive’s tales about ideal operating conditions for ASIC computers. Beyond this, the market is only beginning to discuss environmental factors, contracting and alternative cooling mechanisms. For example, newer market entrants like MicroBT Whatsminers and their various M30S ASIC models are often seen as excellent hardware, but are comparatively under-studied relative to market competitors. In this paper we review empirical data generated via API query across multiple models of Whatsminer M30S to begin answering the broader ASIC question, “How do I make intelligent decisions around self-mining and/or hosting my machines?”  This data should be viewed as the beginning of a conversation around ASIC optimization and not a series of hard and fast rules for operating machines or facilities.  Distributed hash research is dedicated to studying the mining ecosystem and producing content that empowers miners of all sizes and experience levels. For project consultation, hosting, or general inquiries, please email hosting@distributedha.sh  Notes On Miner Data  The following data was collected in a dry, Western environment at an altitude of over 4,000 feet, but below the manufacturer recommended maximum operating altitude of 6,561 feet (2000 meters) for most new generation miners. Data was collected via API query in a single air-cooled datacenter across multiple weeks. Temperature conditions varied between a high of 94.3 F (34.62 C) midday and 41.2 F (5.1 C) in the evenings. Precipitation was 0.22 inches over the period of data collection with humidity between 93% and 15% (average 49%).  Miner Decision-Making: Rates, Hosting And Contracting  Bitcoin miners are taught to consider kWh as the golden number. The sacred kWh is often the single vector of decision-making when deciding when and where to mine. However, as experienced miners will attest, cheap energy is only meaningful when 100% machine uptime is assumed. Additionally, for miners who host their machines with third parties or have signed power purchasing agreements with mandatory minimums or fixed consumption agreements, these contracts are only cost-optimized when uptime is near maximized.  Considering only kWh when mining or hosting is both naive and financially reckless.  Imagine hosting a new generation miner for an agreed upon 6.5c/kW. Your bill starts at $154 per month, plus most companies have additional fees that can push your bill closer to $200 per month per miner (so you’re already at an effective rate of 8.6c/kW before you power up). However, that’s not all that influences your effective kWh rate. The overall uptime of your machine or facility and the way those terms are contracted is, especially these days, becoming a large factor in profitability.  If you’re contracted to pay a fixed $200 per month on your machine (we assume a hosting provider has a cheaper rate per kWh than 6.5c and makes money on the spread). What happens when a heatwave rolls through your state? A provider, or you,  50% of the time while you pay a fixed $200/mo to generate sats via your chosen pool effectively doubles your cost of sats production to over 17c/kW.  Outside of contract issues, uncontrollable factors such as environmental conditions, grid level supply issues (not to mention unexpected geopolitical upheaval) can invert even the most optimal contract for cheap kWh and leave operators hemorrhaging money with no recourse. What’s more, these factors come before consideration of macro bitcoin market conditions such as difficulty and price.  In the future, we hope to provide additional tools for miners to better navigate their hosting agreements, facility operations and external environmental conditions to maximize their sats production and minimize their risks.  Heat, Modes, And Downtime In Whatsminer M30s Models  Ambient heat poses a significant challenge to current air-cooled ASICs.  All miners should consider geography, altitude, humidity, and temperature when choosing which machines to purchase and operate. We look particularly in the following data at various Whatsminer M30S ASICs (M30S 86T, M30S 92T, M30S+ 102T, and M30S++ 106T) and have a few broad suggestions regarding which machines are optimal in environments that are subject to high summer heat.  Consider the above capture of machine-reported environmental temperatures over a five-and-one-half-day period. You will notice a general sine wave pattern reflecting the heat of the midday and the cool of the night. There is a more general cooling effect for the first three days, followed by a number of hot days in quick succession. Additionally, notice how machine-reported environmental temperature towards the right-hand side of the chart becomes more chaotic as ambient temperature increases overall.  A series of hot days are what pose the most serious risk to miner operation. During peak heat hours miners will automatically reset or switch to idle until the ambient temperature cools sufficiently to resume regular hashing. Consider the capture on the following page of four days of miner data with terahash reported on the upper lines and temperature reported on the lower lines. At roughly the same ambient temperature each day a series of machines in this subgroup will overheat and drop hash power until the ambient temperature decreases sufficiently. In the aggregate this is a substantial amount of downtime with negative outcomes for miners on fixed contracts.  Note: This is why distributed hash chooses to bill our hosting clients only on power consumed. This protects the miner from predatory contracting and becoming massively unprofitable during tighter market conditions.  So how can a miner maximize uptime in the most punishing midsummer environments?  Whatsminer machines have the option to toggle between “low,” “normal,” and “high” power modes. The vast majority of the time miners will choose to run their machines in  normal mode, which most closely delivers the TH listed on the machine at the stated wattage. However, during times of high heat it becomes preferable to run your machines in low mode, which, by decreasing the effective wattage of the machine, gives an additional ambient temperature buffer to the hash boards. Consider the below capture over five days showing a series of miners switching from normal to low mode on June 18 and the subsequent elimination of machine overheating.  The effect of switching the M30S ASICs into low mode from normal mode is obvious. No machines overheat during peak temperature days as the lower wattage draw has added an ambient temperature operating buffer. This switch to low mode has proven to be an effective remedy to midday overheating, but miners wonder how much hash they are losing by doing so. The answer is a discussion around chip manufacturing and PSU efficiency that is outside of the scope of this current paper; however, we submit the below data to open the conversation around various models of Whatsminer M30S ASIC:  As you can see in the above chart, when machines are switched from normal to low mode there is a general trend that goes: drop in hash power, larger drop in wattage, increase in watts per terahash. This is intuitive, as the less energy is consumed by a miner the efficiency of the miner increases. Increasing heat int a system will introduce some inefficiency.  What is most intriguing is how a drop in hash on low mode does not correlate directly with wattage across all variations of machine. Note that the highest powered new generation machines, the M30S++ series, remain largely stable in both normal and low mode. This suggests that you can run your top end machine in low mode, gain a temperature buffer for ambient conditions, and still hash within 2Th of the rating of the machine (104.27 actual versus 106 rated). On the other end of the spectrum, the M30S machines, specifically the 92T rated M30S machines, display a substantial non-linear variation in hash and wattage when switched from normal to low mode. For the miner using these machines, it suggests that mode switching should be considered during competitive markets or high ambient temperatures when the efficiency gain is meaningful to sat generation. We speculate that the differences between efficiency in the M30S 86T and M30S 92T ASICs are a consequence of the chip manufacturing process (an assertion outside of the scope of this discussion but interesting nonetheless and worth future study). Finally, the middle of the pack, the M30S+ machines, show efficiency gains that fall directly in the middle of the lower end M30S machines and the top end M30S++ machines.  The final question miners must have is when to switch between modes given certain prices and operating kWh conditions to maximize efficiency of their machines. We have prepared the larger model below, which takes into account various bitcoin price points at various electrical prices for you to determine how to run your personal machines.  Consider the below as rough data aggregation with the intention of optimizing the amount of bitcoin you’re able to generate during tight markets. During clear bull markets the best option is generally to operate at the highest recommended wattage draw of your machine.  If you would like a higher resolution version of this image, please contact us at hosting@distributedha.sh.  Conclusions  In summary, we began by considering the risks associated with using kWh as a single determining metric when operating ASICs. It is important to look into not only the terms of your contract with either your utility or hosting entity, but to also consider the political and geographical risks associated with hosting in certain jurisdictions or climates. There are no hard and fast rules for how to run X miners in Y location, but introducing these factors into the conversation will serve miners in making better decisions.  We continued by reviewing datacenter level figures around ambient variations in temperature and how midday heat can drastically increase miner downtime. We assert that running machines in low mode is the best option to mitigate this threat and continue with an in-depth analysis on a per-machine level to better understand what the nominal terahash losses are, versus efficiency gains measured in watts per terahash.  We found that the highest tier Whatsminer M30S++ machines demonstrate incredibly stable operation across various modes, while the higher terahash M30S machines (92T) demonstrate the highest watt per terahash efficiency gain when switched to low mode. We end our discussion by sharing a more comprehensive table of efficiency per machine across various prices per kWh and bitcoin prices to better educate miners around when to change operating modes.  We hope that you have found this data and the surrounding discussion informative and are better able to strategize around your particular mining operation. Whether you are a backyard miner or a client of a hosting facility, the more information you have around your particular operating situation, the better able you will be to navigate market conditions and advocate for yourself.

"202",599,2022-07-14,"CryptoDaily","The meme token sector now dominates the cryptocurrency market, and it will be seen as the future of crypto as the notion of memes becomes more prevalent.  Since 2021, several crypto titans from across the globe have achieved advancements in this sector.  RoboApe Token (RBA) is the most recent addition to the meme token business and aims to revitalise it. While most investors favour stable cryptocurrencies such as Chainlink (LINK) and Algorand (ALGO), many prefer more recent ones such as RBA.  Let's examine these currencies in further detail to determine if investing in a relatively new cryptocurrency makes sense over stable ones.  Chainlink (LINK)  Chainlink (LINK) is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency that provides investment and safety to the cryptocurrency market.  It promises to provide a dependable and secure bridge between blockchains and other distributed computing networks, enabling users to transfer funds from one platform to another while maintaining full control over their investments. It is an interesting investment opportunity for anyone wishing to join the world of rapid-fire cryptocurrency trading.  In addition, Chainlink's market capitalisation has climbed significantly over the last several years, making it a desirable cryptocurrency. Currently, Chainlink (LINK) is trading at $6.43 and has a market capitalisation of around $3.2 billion.  Chainlink will be one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the next few years, given its proven track record and potential for sustained development. Therefore, Chainlink (LINK) is the most promising investment opportunity regarding reliability and sustainability.  Algorand (ALGO)  The Algorand (ALGO) Token has enjoyed a bullish increase as the total value locked in the DeFi network has increased by around 7%.  In the last several weeks, the ALGO Token has shown bullish tendencies despite the general bearishness of the cryptocurrency market.  The Algorand network has released several noteworthy enhancements and secured a collaboration with FIFA that will aid in promoting the blockchain to millions of users worldwide.  RoboApe (RBA)  RoboApe (RBA) is now undergoing presale and will join the crypto sphere shortly. The project is a decentralised, community-driven network with no centralised authority.  RoboApe's built-in DeFi and DAO characteristics will apparently enable the project and its holders to achieve previously impossible objectives.  RoboApe strives to be a community-driven business that provides a range of financial alternatives to its clients to transform the cryptocurrency market. This is distinct from the traditional form of meme tokens, which increases their utility.  RoboApe (RBA) is a cryptocurrency platform that offers its consumers DeFi, DEX, crypto education, NFTs, eSports, and gaming. The RBA platform provides community members with access to smart contracts, the building of decentralised apps, and ongoing development.  The native token of the platform is RBA. This cryptocurrency on the Ethereum network is a meme coin and an ERC20 token.  The RBA token provides investors with several advantages. Investors will be compensated for holding the token and participating in the minting and trading of NFTs.  The NFT Marketplace on RoboApe is a site where people may buy, sell, and trade NFTs. Due to the meme nature of the token, it distinguishes itself from its rivals by allowing investors to mint photos and GIF memes in the form of RoboApe trading cards.

"203",390,2022-07-13,"AMBCrypto","Environmental activists have been behind crypto and blockchains for a long time now. They have been citing concerns that come with the use of this technology.

On the contrary, the altcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) did witness a slight drop below the neutral 50 line only to show an inclined trend at the time of writing.  The Awesome Oscillator (AO) was clearly not siding with the bulls. Thus, it is difficult to say if SUSHI’s current movement can actually help the token break out of its range."
"204",495,2022-07-13,"Blockchain.News","Greenidge Generation Holdings Inc., a US-based Bitcoin mining company, announced its mining production increased by about 18% in June.  According to its monthly operating update released on Monday, Greenidge said it produced approximately 230 Bitcoins in June, an increase of about 18%, compared to 195 Bitcoins it mined in May.  The miner disclosed that it increased its hashrate capacity to 2.5 exahash per second (""EH/s"") from 27,500 mining machines in June, an increase from 1.7 EH/s of mining capacity from 20,400 mining machines in the previous month.  Greenidge stated that it ordered an additional 200 mining machines, which are in transit, as they will be installed upon their arrival.  The miner said last month it located 24% of the hash rate capacity at its facility in Spartanburg, South Carolina, which was acquired and its operations started in December last year. Greenidge further said it has mined a total of 1,183 Bitcoins for the six months ended June 30.  Meanwhile, at the end of last month, the New York regulator denied the renewal of Greenidge Generation's air permit.  On June 30, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) denied a key permit for a gas-powered cryptocurrency mining facility owned by Greenidge on the shores of Seneca Lake. The regulator said the mining facility produces too much planet-warming pollution that cannot be allowed under the state's climate law.  However, Greenidge vowed to appeal the decision through the legal process and said it will keep operating as usual. The 106 MW Greenidge gas plant hosts a large-scale Bitcoin mining facility, with about 17,000 mining machines.  Adapting the Bear Market  The current sharp decline in Bitcoin price has made it difficult for several mining operations to generate a profit. While this bear market has caused many facilities to close their shop, experienced miners are becoming creative and capturing greater market share.  Successful mining firms have deployed innovative new strategies to gain competitive advantages through energy efficiencies; minimizing capital expenditures and operating expenditures.  Last month, , a major global cryptocurrency mining firm, mined 179 Bitcoins in June compared to 124 BTC in May 2022. The firm sold 637 BTC in June to offset operating expenses and outstanding loans.  Early last month, , a Canada-based Bitcoin mining company, bought 5,800 mining machines to add higher petahashes per second (PH/s) of hashrate to its Bitcoin mining capacity at its Ontario facility.  To address electricity concerns,  (""ACDC""), a U.S.-based crypto mining firm, launched a six-megawatts solar-powered facility for its new mining operations in the western part of Colorado.  The above examples show some of the successful, experienced Bitcoin mining firms that so far have been able to thrive regardless of Bitcoin Price by using flexible, long-term strategies that minimize monthly operating expenses."

The U.K. was the largest importer of Russian gold, accounting for about $16.6 billion (£13.5 billion) worth of gold now anticipated to be affected by the ban.  * The London Bullion Market Association, an international trade association representing the global over-the-counter (OTC) precious metal bullion market, has  the announcements from the participating G7 nations and will coordinate with the sanctions accordingly.  * Russian oligarchs are primary targets for a ban on gold as Western sanctions endeavor to amplify punishments against Russia’s wealthy elite. Sanctions have caused the  in their collective net worth with foreign nations confiscating Russian assets ranging from  to .  * The ban comes at a time when Russia  on its foreign debt obligations for the first time since the  when the Bolshevik government  and other financial obligations—costing foreign investors millions of pounds in lost Russian investments.  Excluding energy industries, precious metals such as gold are Russia’s largest export at  (£17.8 billion) in 2020. Banning the import of Russian gold aims to add economic obstacles for Russia’s participation in global markets and also works to push Russia towards an artificial default on their $40 billion (£38 billion) foreign debt. The isolated nation has the monetary means to make the impending payment, yet cannot do so given the stringent economic sanctions placed against them as well as countries freezing their foreign currency reserves held abroad.  In practice, international sanctions have wholly restricted the Russian government’s ability to make any payments and have effectively cornered Russia into international default. Centralized international systems like the  (SWIFT) will arbitrate the final settlement of funds depending on diplomatic relations with that nation, whereas Bitcoin does not discriminate against end-users — no matter the intent of the end-user so long as they follow the  of the Bitcoin network.  The blacklisting of newly refined or mined Russian gold exemplifies the necessity of an immutable and fungible alternative form of money resistant against authorities having jurisdiction—regardless of that authority’s intentions. The Bitcoin network, a permissionless and relatively instant final settlement layer without any intermediaries, serves to provide the most reliable and secure payment system capable of transacting with anyone across the Earth. It would then follow that Bitcoin’s permissionless nature makes it the , like Russia, but similarly the ideal money for oneself.  While the participating members of the G7 have conveyed the ban’s intention is to bring a resolution to the tragic and needless war in Ukraine, the decisions made by those members do not provide a podium for a majority of the world to participate in these tight-knit, globally influential discussions.  One Group To Rule Them All  The G7, an international coalition consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union as a non-enumerated member, addresses macroeconomic and monetary issues to achieve their global socio-economic goals. Originating from an ad hoc gathering of finance ministers centered around the , their scope of discussion has broadened to also include international security, environmental objectives and humanitarian crises.  Although lacking a legal or institutional basis, these upper crust leaders wield substantial sway in the outcome of international diplomacy and economic action. Chosen representatives from non-member states and international organizations are invited to the summits as guests, yet the significantly influential group remains highly exclusive to formally join. The current countries in the G7 account for roughly  of the collective global net wealth and make up , or approximately 10% of the global population.  Every year the G7 deliberates on the increasing instabilities of the world and how to solve them. Although the  for the summit is to “progress towards an equitable world,” the people that are likely to be most affected by global instabilities are excluded from participating in the discussion. In effect, the summit’s ambitious goals are largely dependent on the self-interests of affluent countries representing a fraction of the global population. In some respects, the G7 operates as an oligarchy themselves given the disproportionate representation of the demographic they’re supposedly serving.  If there were ever to be a globally coordinated attack against the Bitcoin network, then it would likely originate from a multinational organization with established diplomatic prowess. The global decentralization of hash rate (miners) and full nodes (users) maintain the impracticality of a nefarious entity, perhaps a coalition of nations, seeking to  or  to limit blockchain accessibility.  Although the U.S. has seen a  of international mining operations seeking a stable political environment to cheaply mine bitcoin following the “  ” China ban on bitcoin mining, the  in a single nation presents a situation not much more comforting than when bitcoin miners in China contributed to more than half of all network hash rate before the China ban. The consolidation of a majority of hashrate under one jurisdictional umbrella further enables potentially detrimental U.S. government intervention.  1 BTC = 1 BTC  A refusal to import newly refined or mined gold purely because of its provenance is an attack on the monetary characteristics of gold. Gold as a mode of payment fails if , the equal exchange of one unit for another unit, is no longer recognized by a transacting party. Similarly, bitcoin must exhibit total fungibility between , currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin currency, else the Bitcoin network would fail as a permissionless monetary system if an exclusive, powerful group of leaders can deny bitcoin payments because their provenance is decreed illegal.  The ban, if hypothetically directed at Bitcoin mining, would deem all newly mined bitcoin by any Russian-affiliated mining operations as a criminal offense to transact with and therefore worthless outside of Russia. Such a ban would affect about 4.6% of the network hash rate (estimate prone to error due to redirected IP addresses via the use of VPN or proxy services) and accordingly 4.6% of all newly mined bitcoin on average. Because Bitcoin implements  and not , any attempt to blacklist the accumulation or distribution of newly mined bitcoin does not catalyze authority of the network’s ledger simply by virtue of possessing a majority of the circulation supply.  Although Bitcoin exhibits the necessary monetary properties of scarcity, portability, fungibility, divisibility, durability and acceptability, there are companies that specialize in exposing the privacy missteps of Bitcoin users which only serves to degrade fungibility for those users. Blockchain analyzing firms leverage the open ledger’s transparency to potentially yield identifying information from one’s  history; and then  to determine ownership of addresses. In other words, one’s total bitcoin net worth can be gleaned from the blockchain if privacy practices are not prioritized.  The pseudo-anonymous transparency of the Bitcoin network is intentional; however, this can also work to . Fungibility, and consequently user privacy, can improve, but requires more than just a few concerned tech-savvy people in the corner of a room to make meaningful improvement.  of increasing fungibility and security are  ; such methods often require proactive UTXO management and technical know-how when sending bitcoin payments to a merchant, friend or to one’s own cold storage wallet.  Bitcoiners must work to implement and advance privacy solutions to ultimately solidify the fungibility of the bitcoin currency. If a vast majority of network participants voluntarily buy and send bitcoin from a custodial exchange requiring checks on  (AML/KYC), then the on-ramps to owning or sending even a single satoshi will be increasingly subject to centralized intermediary discretion.  A quick, simple way to transact more privately is using the Lightning Network, a second layer instant payment system, which, while imperfect, does help to obfuscate one’s transaction history. There are many  available to begin learning the nuances of privacy when transacting in bitcoin. One can even purchase non-KYC bitcoin through the Lightning Network using !  Closing Thoughts  The effectiveness of this ban will not be immediately known; indeed, a global effort to enforce the restriction of Russian gold imports and inflict Russian default would not serve to help global debt markets — making investors more cautious and less willing to advance capital which could result in a domino effect of defaults in other emerging markets.  Heightened inflation at a multinational scale and global commodity shortages exacerbated by supply chain disruptions are the result of restricting access to international trade networks, either because of the pandemic or the war in Ukraine. Gold is historically an inflation hedge and many people, including Russian oligarchs, seek financial security in buying gold. The totality of the ban’s ramifications may be subtle, but the precedent is set and Bitcoin is fair game for the G7 nations.  As mentioned, Bitcoiners must take proactive measurements in individual privacy to supplement bitcoin fungibility. Bitcoin can still be valuable in purchasing power but fail as a permissionless, peer-to-peer transactional layer if fungibility is compromised.

Here is all you need to know about the coin’s performance over the last three days.  An overview of the last 72 hours  MATIC was trading at $0.52 before the announcement on 7 July. Priced at $0.5746 at press time, the altcoin’s price saw an 8% hike in three days. Within that period, the coin’s market capitalization also registered a 10% hike from $4.18 billion on 7 July to $4.60 billion.  Interestingly, during a 24-hour window period, the crypto saw a decline in its performance. According to data from , with the price pegged at $0.5746, a 3% decline was logged.  Data from  also revealed a 55.75% decline in trading volume over the last 24 hours.

New York State’s Department of Environmental Conservation to the upstate Greenidge Generating Facility, which produces electricity for the power grid and also mines bitcoin.  Greenidge stated that the decision, announced on Thursday, to deny them a new “Title V” Air Emissions permit will “not have any impact on our current operations.”  The firm, located in New York’s Finger Lakes region, said it will continue to operate its natural gas-fired plant as it appeals DEC’s decision. In a statement, the company said “We can continue running uninterrupted under our existing Title V air permit, which is still in effect, for as long as it takes to successfully challenge this arbitrary and capricious decision.” The company stated its intention to pursue legal actions if their appeal is not successful.  Source:   Climate Activists Urge Governor Hochul To Take The Next Step  Referring to the recent legislative bill to put a two-year moratorium on cryptocurrency mining, Yvonne Taylor of the Seneca Lake Guardian organization said, “Governor (Kathy) Hochul must finish the job by signing the crypto moratorium.”  The moratorium bill passed both the Senate and the Assembly, and now awaits Hochul’s signature. Hochul recently said, however, that she doesn’t anticipate looking at the bill until late this year.  Activists continue to push for the moratorium, as they contend that other mining operations are looking to set up shop in New York state. Other gas-fired power plants are being eyed by cryptocurrency mining operations, according to Sen. Kevin Parker (D), one of the cosponsors of the moratorium bill.  Assembly Cryptocurrency Supporters Launch Compromise Bill  In a recent development, the New York State Assembly has passed a bill to direct the New York State Department of Financial Services to establish a task force to study cryptocurrency mining, without imposing a moratorium. Introduced by Clyde Vanel (D),  would propose studying various aspects of cryptocurrency, including consumer and investor protections. The bill passed the Assembly by a vote of 122-25 on March 28.  The New York State Senate also passed the bill, on June 2, overwhelmingly, by a vote of 61-2.  That bill now also goes to Governor Hochul for signature.  Cryptocurrency Proponents Continue To Tout Benefits Of Mining  Construction and trade unions, especially the electrical workers union, have been big proponents of the cryptocurrency mining industry. Establishing mining operations using previously-shuttered power plants could create thousands of good paying jobs in upstate New York, they claim. The area is part of the vast Northeast “Rust Belt,” which has been bleeding manufacturing jobs for decades.  And of course, when making their case to state government officials, proponents are quick to point out that these operations may very well generate significant tax revenue for the state.  New York State in many ways has long been considered the financial capital of the United States, and cryptocurrency advocates want to ensure that the state does all it can to foster a climate that is business-friendly and a home to innovative technologies.

"211",671,2022-07-09,"CryptoDaily","Today, the cryptocurrency market is one of the most popular investment opportunities, and it is simple to see why. Cryptocurrencies offer a great substitute for fiat currency.  These are digital, decentralised peer-to-peer currencies that aim to change the financial system and serve as a solution to the issues.  Encryption, which is semi-anonymous, not under the control of other parties, borderless, secure, inexpensive, and quick, is the primary factor contributing to the growth of crypto.  In the cryptocurrency market, there have been several sorts of currencies offering their own uses. Utility tokens are noteworthy owing to their real-world uses and are feasible long-term cryptocurrency investments. Flow (FLOW) is one of the dominant utility tokens on the market.  Meme Tokens, another category that was formerly considered a lost cause, is currently advancing quickly. Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) are among the most well-known cryptocurrencies launched in this industry.  Recently, a new meme token, RoboApe (RBA), was presented to the market. This platform claims to alter analysts' and investors' perceptions of the meme world. It aims to transform the world of meme tokens. Let's go further into what it has to offer.  Flow (FLOW)  Flow (FLOW), a blockchain developed by DapperLabs for Decentralised Applications (dApps), focuses on NFTs and the development of online games in the Metaverse. Flow is quick and has minimal transaction costs. It utilises Proof-of-Stake to power its network.  FLOW is the native coin of the Flow blockchain and is used to store and power all transactions on the network.  The Flow (FLOW) coin has already shown significant promise with the success of its NBA Top Shot NFTs, which had over 3 million active members at the time of writing.  This coin is quickly gaining traction and has risen to the top 35 cryptocurrencies with a market valuation of about $2 billion.  The Flowverse comprises the integration of the Flow network into the Metaverse. Here, users can stake FLOW tokens and conduct transactions with them; other DeFi tokens and NFTs will also be linked into Flowverse transactions, making it an attractive long-term cryptocurrency investment.  RoboApe (RBA)  The RoboApe (RBA) token is a futuristic meme token aiming to transform the meme token culture with various user-friendly services. It believes that resolving economic restrictions via a culture of sustainability and reward will enhance and permit development.  It is a unique utility deflation token that returns more than it takes.  Additionally, it will provide a DeFi platform for meme and cryptocurrency fans.  It will be implemented by prohibiting team incentives and monetisation techniques. It will be a community-driven platform DAO, preventing team members from controlling its governance and empowering the community to make choices.  With the RBA token, the platform will give multiple financial options.  The ecosystem will be community-driven, with decentralised interaction and revenue generation alternatives. RBA is a token for deflationary memes.  There will be a transaction charge associated with each transaction.  Half of the charge will be burned, while the other half will be returned to users. It causes the RBA token supply to decrease with each transaction.  This deflationary process ensures the token's longevity and enhances its value.  This ecosystem is not limited to conventional blockchain systems and will offer a one-stop-shop for all cryptocurrencies.  Users can purchase, sell, and trade NFTs on the RoboApeNFT Marketplace. It will include an RBA gas price for minting new NFT units via a new smart contract. Once produced, the NFT will appear in the creator's wallet without any fees.

He spent four years in the infantry before transitioning to the Finance Corps.  Dutch Farmers are out in strength as a  is expected to cause one in three livestock farmers in the country to lose their businesses. While I think we can all agree that less pollution is better, the proposed solution doesn’t even fix the problem, it just moves the pollution somewhere else. The only thing the Netherlands seems to actually be reducing is domestic food security at the expense of their farmers.  Fiat society breeds fiat mindsets; fiat mindsets breed fiat solutions. If we can’t see the problem anymore, then it must have been fixed, right?  You Can’t Solve Low Time-Preference Problems With High Time-Preference Thinking  The government wants farmers to reduce pollution stemming from animal waste. An admiral goal — a low time-preference goal. I don’t think anyone would disagree with this policy in principle. The unreasonable timeline, however, seems to be a coercive measure to force these farmers out of business.  Will Dutch animal product consumption go down based on this legislation?  What will happen to emissions now that animal products presumably have to travel further to reach markets?  What does the government think about animal waste in the locations from which the Netherlands will need to import their goods now?  It’s hard not to think that decisions like this weren’t really thought out on a long time horizon. Fiat currencies lack scarcity, the absence of which obscures the idea of trade-offs. In a system without scarcity, people are tricked into thinking they can have their beef and eat it too; if I can’t see the poop, then it’s no longer a problem.  Incentives Are Stronger Than Coercion  The view of animal waste is flawed. As mentioned, this doesn’t even fix the problem, it just exports it.  Beyond domestic food security and the second highest agricultural exports in the world, what if the Netherlands was also exporting a potentially valuable and renewable energy source?  In 2021, the  about a farmer who was using an anaerobic digester to produce methane, and in turn, used that methane to generate electricity and mine cryptocurrencies.  This is an inventive system that can truly allow for environmental goals to be achieved. Under the current regime, waste products are nothing more than an inconvenient and expensive cost of business.  By transforming your waste into an asset and potentially diversifying income streams, farmers are incentivized to be better stewards of animal waste. Every ounce of poo not properly gathered means a leak in your energy system; a system that is less efficient than it could be. With the war in Ukraine forcing Germany to , why would anyone want to waste a precious and renewable energy resource?  Stop Opting For Fiat Solutions  I’m not going to try to calculate the elasticity of Dutch demand for meat, assuming prices will rise at least a little bit through the necessity of importation. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist, however, to see that this decision makes pollution worse, not better. If demand is even close to where it is prior to the decision, emissions are added to the system via importation supply chains.  Just like using the money printer to paper over mistakes, this decision simply moves the problem out of sight and out of mind.  Only through the adoption of incentive systems rather than coercion systems can long-term problems truly be solved.  Only through the adoption of a bitcoin standard, can governments and individuals change their mindset to a truly long-term perspective. Trade-offs can only be understood in a system with scarcity and free market signals. Fix the money, fix the world. Now let’s go monetize some poop.  This is a guest post by Mickey Koss.

Additionally, Infrawatch PH convenor Terry Ridon asserted that Binance violated regulations in the Philippines by operating as a virtual asset service provider (VASP) without a license.  Binance has faced numerous regulatory issues that only seem to get worse. Furthermore, unrestricted investor access to digital currencies that financial officials are unaware of and the absence of conventional investors pose threats.  Binance carrying out unrestricted activities?  Last month, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, stated that the exchange aims to secure virtual asset service provider (VASP) and electronic money issuer (EMI) licenses despite not being registered in the Philippines.  To which Terry Ridon, convenor of Infrawatch, wrote in the letter, “Their unregistered activity allows Filipinos to buy and sell cryptocurrencies and with wanton disregard of Philippine regulations. They perform the functions of a Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) through an unregulated platform.”  However, a Binance spokeswoman responded to the allegations stated in the letter. She said that the organization takes compliance issues seriously. Additionally, the organization also plans to collaborate with government officials, law enforcement, and business leaders to improve the industry’s security and sustainability.  The Binance official also stated that the exchange strictly enforces compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the exchange has made Know Your Customer (KYC) policies a requirement for its users. The official continued by saying that investments in compliance programs had not stopped.  Regulatory issues for Binance  Binance has aggressively introduced new cryptocurrencies and most recently it introduced NFTs. These recent additions have been introduced in the absence of a set process. This may end up putting Binance in a fix. Furthermore, since the start of 2022, Binance has been the target of litigations worldwide. A new lawsuit has been filed against the organization for allegedly misrepresenting TerraUSD, a stablecoin.  Investor Jeffrey Lockhart brought the lawsuit. The lawsuit states that Binance misrepresented information about TerraUSD as security. According to Lockhart’s lawsuit, TerraUSD is not registered with the SEC or any state regulators.  Additionally, as per  that investigations into cryptocurrency exchange Binance have been broadened by the US to look at potential insider trading and market manipulation. The investigation has also included officials examining if Binance or its employees profited from exploiting its users.  Not the first time for Infrawatch  Infrawatch PH has already objected to the exchange’s activity in the nation. The research group contacted the Philippine central bank in June and asked the organization to take legal action against Binance. Infrawatch described Binance as a “risk to the public” and cited the cryptocurrency meltdown as justification."

"216",1238,2022-07-08,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Vishvas Garg, a Ph.D. in pharmacoeconomics, epidemiology, pharmaceutical policy and outcomes research from the University of New Mexico.  Compared to the total world population of over 7.7 billion people, bitcoin is owned in less than 150 million wallets today. While this does not mean one wallet translates to one person, it is safe to assume that the vast majority of the world population still doesn’t own any bitcoin at this time.  Block and Wakefield Research conducted a  of 14 countries and reported that education is the key to bitcoin adoption. People with higher levels of knowledge about Bitcoin were found to be more optimistic about its future. Furthermore, lack of knowledge was found to be the top reason for people not buying the asset.  Bitcoin is a revolutionary force, but to significantly grow its rate of adoption, the knowledge and perception of Bitcoin needs to improve. This can be done by establishing an evidence-based value proposition of bitcoin. Having an evidence-based value proposition for bitcoin available can also enable major investments from various institutions: private, public or government.  To help understand the importance of such a value proposition of bitcoin, let’s use the example of a  by Ark Invest and Block (then Square). This paper has shown that bitcoin is key to an abundant, clean energy future, as it could enable deployment of substantially more solar and wind energy capacity. What if we can leverage the findings of this research to understand the acceleration of the transition to renewable energy and assess what quantifiable value bitcoin can deliver for society, consumers, merchants, policymakers and financial institutions?  An evidence-based case can be made with:  * Policymakers: Why bitcoin adoption should be part of the carbon elimination strategy with key stakeholders such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  * Consumers: How owning bitcoin and supporting bitcoin mining are doing their part in the fight against climate change.  * Merchants: How small, medium and large businesses can help fight climate change through bitcoin adoption.  * Society: How the bitcoin-led transition to renewable energy can create a sustainable planet while providing prosperity through creation of new jobs.  * Financial institutions: Why any good ESG-type index should have bitcoin investments as a key criteria for inclusion.  In another instance, as I briefly discussed in my recently published , I believe bitcoin can deliver high-quality, equitable healthcare in an affordable manner to everyone. In upcoming articles, I will share more details on this proposal.  To further enable the global adoption of bitcoin, a framework is needed that can be used to quantify its value proposition. One state-of-the-art framework to quantify the value of bitcoin that is currently available is . This framework is an excellent approach to calculate the price and performance of bitcoin through the fundamental analysis of its network and adoption. However, as Cathie Wood — who I believe is the Benjamin Graham of the modern era — may kindly agree with me, sometimes price and network adoption may lag the long-term value of any asset. This may be especially true for a generational innovation like bitcoin that involves network effects.  The Ark Invest bitcoin valuation framework is highly complementary to the proposal suggested in this article. One way to understand this concept is to compare the Ark Invest framework to Benjamin Graham’s framework for securities from “ .” For one to fully understand the growth potential of Bitcoin, particularly due to its network effects, a comprehensive qualitative and quantitative thinking framework is warranted that can be leveraged to capture the full long-term value proposition of bitcoin.  Based on this comprehensive qualitative and quantitative thinking, a framework of three concentric circles that comprehensively captures the full long-term value proposition of bitcoin is proposed below. See the first figure for more information.  The first and the innermost concentric circle is the core of this framework. This core is based on the following three big questions:  * What is the unmet need? This is the purpose of bitcoin.  * What are the benefits of fulfilling the unmet need? This is the benefit of bitcoin.  * Why is Bitcoin the best and only candidate to fulfill the unmet need? This is the potential of bitcoin.  The middle concentric circle is constituted by the PESTLE (political, economic, social, technology, legal and environment) factors from Mike Morrison’s “ .” Originally, the PESTLE framework was proposed to understand the impact of external factors on an organization. However, the proposed framework calls for the inverse — to seek the answers to the three questions posed in the innermost circle in the context of the PESTLE factors.  The outermost concentric circle represents the direct and indirect stakeholders that can be impacted by bitcoin adoption or lack thereof. Depending on the stakeholder under assessment, the answers to the three questions posed in the context of the PESTLE factors may differ. For example, in understanding the economic benefits of addressing the unmet needs of today’s trust-based financial institutions, the answer may be different for the society or consumers versus the financial institutions themselves.  (Graphic/Vishvas Garg)  I know that Jack Dorsey wouldn’t want me to do this, but given the instrumental impact his ideas had on shaping my own, I would like to kindly propose that this framework be called the “Blockhead Three Circles (BTC) Value Framework.”  How Can This Framework Be Used?  This framework can be leveraged to assess the total long-term net benefit of bitcoin, qualitatively or quantitatively, for all direct and indirect key stakeholders, including consumers, merchants, policymakers, financial institutions and society.  Such assessments will positively impact the knowledge and perception of bitcoin, which in turn, can help drive its adoption globally.  What Are The Next Steps?  There are three major next steps:  * Finalize the structure of the proposed BTC Value Framework: Anyone who would like to give feedback and inputs into this framework is welcome to provide their input directly to my . I will post a link to this article on my profile upon publication.  * Build an open-source model based on the BTC Value Framework: One way to benefit from the framework proposed in the current article is to build a model based on it that can help generate evidence to support the value of bitcoin adoption. I call upon the fellow Bitcoin community to support the development of this model. This model should be built using the “bitcoin standard” and be freely accessible to anyone in this world.  * Accelerate evidence generation to assess the value of bitcoin: As of today, the research studies evaluating the value of bitcoin are still scarce. Especially if we review the existing literature through the lens of the proposed BTC Value Framework, it becomes clear how major the gaps are in the value proposition of bitcoin. Given this, a long-term, open-source, coordinated effort for the development of bitcoin’s value proposition is warranted. This effort should be as open-source and inclusive as the technical development of bitcoin itself. Such an effort will create a new high bar for scientific research across any discipline.

Ever since Bitcoin came into existence in 2009, it has provided people with a new method of exchanging, transferring, and earning money digitally. Despite the recent unnerving occurrences of the crypto market, people are still eager to purchase viable and reliable coins to succeed in their journey to reach financial fruition. Here are three eco-conscious crypto coins that have the potential to do so: Big Eyes (BIG), Avalanche (AVAX), and Cardano (ADA).  Keep an eye out for Big Eyes (BIG)  If you are a buyer looking for a coin that provides something new and innovative to the market, Big Eyes (BIG) is the coin for you. It is an upcoming community-driven meme token that aims to move affluence to the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem whilst protecting an important part of the world’s atmosphere. The blockchain network plans to give more to the crypto ecosystem by having a self-propagating platform, permitting its holders to use NFTs that propose access to more events and content.  BIG will launch on the decentralised network protocol Uniswap - a blockchain network ranked nineteenth on CoinMarketCap. This will contribute to the succession of Big Eyes, as Uniswap has a consistently reputable market capitalisation and would push BIG to an expanded audience within the crypto community. But the most distinct element that Big Eyes has to offer is its mascot - a large-eyed cat that has a cute and detailed anime design. BIG has deliberately used a cat as their mascot as it diverts from what is traditionally used for meme coins, notably dogs. A unique selling point well established in online media but yet to find its space within crypto. It currently plans to have 90% of its 200,000,000,000 tokens available at launch, along with a charity wallet that donates 5% of its earnings to ocean-based charities.  Branch out your portfolio with Avalanche (AVAX)  Avalanche (AVAX) is one of the most successful blockchain networks in the crypto market. A layer one blockchain-primarily known for being able to conduct approximately 6,500 transactions per second, not comprising its sustainability while labelling its speed ""blazingly fast"".  AVAX is a strong competitor of Ethereum, aiming to leapfrog over its cousin as the most popular blockchain network known for its smart contracts. Avalanche can deploy customised blockchains that benefit the application needs of its users, permitting people to build their virtual machine while outlining how it operates.  Furthermore, AVAX attempts to solve the blockchain trilemma which posits that blockchain cannot achieve decentralisation at scale. Even further, it boasts the best finality speeds in the industry.  Additionally, major DeFi players from Ethereum such as Curve and Aave have decided to launch on Avalanche during their rush DeFi initiative. With a solid market capitalisation of $4,840,705,280 and a rank of seventeenth on CoinMarketCap- Avalanche is a network that will provide you with eco-friendly protocols and lightning speed.  Preserve energy with Cardano (ADA)  Cardano (ADA) is a blockchain network known for its proof-of-stake consensus which states its goal of allowing ‘innovators, visionaries, and changemakers’ to bring about a positive international change. It has been referred to as ‘the green blockchain’ by crypto enthusiasts and journalists due to its reputable sustainability and environmentally friendly nature. Cardano aims to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to individuals - aiding the creation of a transparent, fair, and secure blockchain network.  ADA is also one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use the proof-of-stake consensus, its primary factor that makes it more sustainable than Bitcoin which uses the proof-of-work algorithm. Proof-of-stake is more energy efficient as it eliminates complex computations. Furthermore, Cardanotakes pride in guaranteeing that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research - which means ideas are challenged and means-tested before they are validated. Currently ranked the eighth most profitable crypto on CoinMarketCap - Cardano has established a solidreputation for itself through brilliant execution of the proof-of-stake consensus.

"220",523,2022-07-06,"Cryptonews.com","There has been a sharp increase in regulations targeting the crypto space, with regulatory bodies mainly in North America and Europe aiming for everything from non-fungible tokens (  ) to stablecoins and ordinary cryptocurrencies, found a global RegTech (regulatory technology) firm CUBE.  In a new report on the regulatory outlook for the crypto space, CUBE said that there has been a 7,436% increase in crypto-related regulatory messaging in the past four years, compared to pre-2018.  For 2021, the report found a large increase in new regulations using the terms “Virtual & Cryptocurrencies.”  Regulations focused on other crypto-related topics such as “Bitcoin,” “Digital asset,” “Crypto” and “Non-fungible token (NFT)” also saw significant growth last year, although to a lesser extent than “Virtual & Cryptocurrencies.”  The change in the use of various terms goes to show that “a new iteration” in crypto tends to be developed just as regulators have “come to terms with the latest development,” the report said.  Further, the report acknowledged that the crypto market has already grown to become a critical piece of the global financial system, and that risks from crypto could spill over into traditional markets.  “As the participation of investors increases for cryptocurrency, so too do the risks that market volatility for crypto could have a knock-on effect for the global economy. It is fast becoming a financial stability risk,” the report said.  CUBE added that most of the regulatory issuance comes from North America and Europe, accounting for 51% and 32%, respectively, of all new regulations in the space.  In these regions, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) have been among the most active in issuing new regulations.  Among the issues that CUBE finds regulators have missed is the sustainability aspect of crypto. According to CUBE CEO Ben Richmond, global regulators need to drive forward regulations that show that crypto can “thrive without undermining” efforts to mitigate climate change.  And although Richmond admitted that there are “aspects of ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] and crypto that do work in tandem,” he argued that the failure to address the environmental impact of crypto will lead to “an inevitable clash of two titans that could set the trajectory of the modern financial world back significantly.”  Looking ahead, the report said that regulators face a universal challenge in managing crypto risks at a global level. And although many national regulators, for the time being, appear to be focused on stablecoins as the most urgent area to regulate, there is “uncertainty as to whether any regulatory regime will hold” without increased global cooperation.  In conclusion, the report said that “time is running out before the volatility of crypto bleeds into global financial stability.” As a result, it is likely that regulators – in an attempt to get faster results – will “stretch existing regimes to cater for cryptocurrencies.”  The report added that,  “In turn, they may use stablecoins as a blueprint for new regulation to come. Undoubtedly, international bodies will work tirelessly to tie centralised regulation together with a decentralised currency.”  ____"
"221",481,2022-07-06,"CryptoDaily","Co-founder of the Cardano blockchain, Charles Hoskinson, joined Vitalik Buterin in expressing his displeasure over the recent criticism of the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. The reaction was in response to Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song’s stinging criticism of the consensus mechanism.  Jimmy Song’s Proof-of-Stake Criticism  Proof-of-Stake had recently come under some criticism, primarily from Bitcoin developer Jimmy Song, who stated that the consensus protocol does not give a definitive solution for the Byzantine Generals Problem. Song’s argument found support in Emin Gun Sirer, founder of Ava Labs, who stated,  “Proof of Stake isn’t a consensus algorithm. I think I was the first person to publicly point this out years ago. Anyone who doesn’t understand this should, in Jimmy’s words, stay out of the discussion.”  Hoskinson Calls Claims Stupid  Charles Hoskinson also waded into the conversation, quoting Jimmy Song’s tweet and stating that the “level of stupid here is beyond explanation.” In an attempt to further buttress his argument, Song stated that with the Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, it is impossible to ascertain the canonicity of a blockchain without having to refer to a central authority, thus defeating the entire purpose of decentralization.  Hoskinson, when asked about his thoughts regarding Song’s claim, simply referred to the paper on the Proof-of-Stake blockchain “Ouroboros Genesis: Composable Proof-of-Stake Blockchains with Dynamic Availability,” stating that all of Song’s claims and doubts are addressed in it. Song had argued that anyone not understanding his assertion is not qualified to comment on Proof-of-Stake.  Vitalik Buterin’s Comments  Hoskinson was not the only one who was shocked by Song’s line of argument, with Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin also responding to the claims on Sunday. Buterin stated that one-line technicalities involving the definition of a line of argument should not be the basis for condemning the line of an argument.  The Byzantine General’s Problem  The Byzantine Generals Problem refers to a theory that describes the level of difficulty faced by decentralized systems when they attempt to achieve consensus. For example, Bitcoin uses the Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism to reach a consensus through miners, each of who serves as an independent general. However, Proof-of-Work is hugely energy intensive, which has given rise to significant concerns around its environmental impacts, with some countries completely banning Bitcoin mining within their borders. Proof-of-Stake solves this problem by being far more efficient while consuming significantly lesser energy. However, Proof-of-Work proponents such as Song have argued that Proof-of-Stake is not completely decentralized.  Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As , Ripple upgraded its serves in order to let validators vote in favor of implementing the aforementioned standard. The developer team started testing whether or not the XRPL would be able to support the additional transaction load brought by on-ledger NFTs.  The RippleX team was able to reach the peak sustained throughput of 2,199 transactions per second when XRP payments.

The streaming service detailed its plans for incorporating Web3 into its business in its latest Litepaper V1.  Interim CEO of Napster, Emmy Lovell, stated,  ""We’re entering the streaming-plus era of music, which is one of the few scaled business sectors where adoption of blockchain tech actually makes immediate sense for everyone. People who make music, people who listen to it and those who own its IP all already depend heavily on technology. Web3 offers a chance to deepen, extend and improve the music ecosystem.”  The Litepaper mentions that Algorand is the only carbon-negative blockchain infrastructure currently in existence, indicating Napster’s focus on sustainability.  The Napster Network  $PSTER will be capped at 10 billion tokens and will be used as a payment method for music subscriptions, exclusive content from specific artists, and premium features of the streaming service. Token holders can also use them to pay for goods and services on third-party applications interoperable with the Napster Network. The token will also enable fans to be a part of an exclusive content drop or even collaborate in the studio with their favorite band. For professional artists and music makers, the platform is launching a collection of tools and services called the Artists Studio, which will democratize opportunities, improve collaboration, and add supplementary revenue sources.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC)  on Thursday that Greenidge's Bitcoin mining operation does not meet the requirements of state climate laws.  Greenidge Generation applied for the renewal of its air permit in March 2021.  In a statement, NYSDEC said that Greenidge's application was inconsistent with the climate goals highlighted by the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which focuses on reducing New York's greenhouse gas emission by at least 85% by 2050.  The regulator stated that a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions from Greenidge's Dresden-based power generation facility has been noticed since the previous permit was issued to the crypto mining company in 2016 and after the Climate Act (CLCPA) was enacted in 2019.  However, Greenidge stated that the decision by the regulator would not have any impact on our current operations in Dresden. The firm said it will continue operating its mining business under its current air permit while it challenges the NYSDEC ruling in court.  Greenidge said its ""facility represents a remarkably insignificant 0.2% of New York's target GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions level for 2030"" and that the level of its emissions is down by 70% compared to the reference date of 1990 under the law.  Meanwhile, the Governor of New York state, Kathy Hochul, congratulated NYSDEC's move to nullify Greenidge's license. I applaud NYSEC's decision, which will stop future increases in greenhouse gas emissions at Seneca Lake, the Governor tweeted.  On the other hand, workers and union members who are employed at Greenidge's Dresden facility have expressed their disappointment by the NYSDEC's decision as well as the proposed mining moratorium passed at the beginning of this month.  Early this month, emotions were high after the New York State Senate  that barred fossil fuel power plants from creating new projects to provide energy to proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency mines for two years.  On 4 th June, state assemblywoman Anna Kelles, who sponsored the bill, as well as environmentalists, called on New York Governor Kathy Hochul not just to sign the bill into law, but also to deny air permits for Greenidge Bitcoin mining firm.  The environmental groups thanked the elected New York lawmakers who passed the bill through the state's two houses.  The bill effectively prohibited the establishment of new Bitcoin mines that utilize behind-the-meter fossil fuel power by denying air permits to the power plants that provide them with electricity. Greenidge Generation is one of two Bitcoin mining firms that use this model in New York state.

Entering the meme coin scene, the Big Eyes (BIG) mascot is changing the game with their cute crypto cat who has a passion for sushi. With unsurprisingly huge anime-style eyes, this cat is likely to steal hearts internationally, and he’s asking for just one thing: circulate his cryptocurrency coin to save the seas. After all, more fish means more food.  How is Big Eyes Saving the Ocean?  At launch, 90% of the 200,000,000,000 coins will be available, with an additional 5% going to a charity wallet. This wallet is donating to ocean sanctuaries, giving Big Eyes more delicious fish for his sushi. On their Cat Command Roadmap, Big Eyes considers these charity donations every step of the way.  Stage One is ‘Crouch’ - the cryptocurrency coin is launched and the social channels go live. Stage Two is ‘Leap’ and this is where the sanctuaries start seeing the benefits, as the first charity donation is made. Stage Three is ‘Run’. At this point, Big Eyes (BIG) aims to have 50,000 holders, making the second donation potentially very lucrative. Stage Four is ‘Catwalk’ and is all about community events. For the ocean sanctuaries ‘Catwalk’ means a donation of $1 million. All for the oceans. All to save the fish.  How do Ocean Sanctuaries Make a Difference?  Our oceans are in severe need of protection. They are an essential part of our climate’s natural balance, as water covers over 70% of our planet and provides food for billions of people. However, industrial fishing, oil spills, climate change, and plastic pollution have all had a toll on ocean health. As our planet warms, so do our oceans. Sea levels are rising and the waters are absorbing a higher rate of carbon dioxide, putting the delicate equilibrium of the ocean out of balance.  Ocean sanctuaries are like national parks underwater. Within the sanctuary, marine life is protected from oil drilling, fishing, mining, and the direct effects of human activity. Although overall ocean pollution and climate change can’t be filtered out, this pressure relief should help some of the ocean wildlife regain strength and flourish.  (Source: Greenpeace)  The good news for Big Eyes: ocean sanctuaries allow fish stocks to recover with more (and bigger) fish. Without the direct impact of oil drilling and pollution, these fish will hopefully be healthier too. This is essential for communities that rely on fish for their diet, and also helps to regulate the climate. Whales and krill both store carbon in the deep sea for thousands of years, helping to purify the air. Just like protecting our forests, we must protect our seas.  With help from charity donations like the ones expected from Big Eyes (BIG), these ocean sanctuaries can spread across the globe and protect marine wildlife, improving the biodiversity of the waters. This should have a powerful impact on climate change, helping to remove carbon from our atmosphere.

The legislation will require players within the crypto ecosystem to “declare information on their environmental and climate footprint.”  In addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will “develop draft regulatory technical standards on the content, methodologies, and presentation of information related to principal adverse environmental and climate-related impact.”  Further, within the next two years, the European Commission will publish a report on the environmental impact of crypto-assets. With this report, the Commission will introduce “mandatory minimum sustainability standards for consensus mechanisms, including the proof-of-work.”  The not-so “stable”coins  While noting the recent events that have plagued the stablecoins market, the Council stated that the risks posed to holders of these categories of assets are heightened without a regulatory framework.  With the proposed MiCA, issuers of stablecoins will be required to build a sufficient liquid reserve with a 1/1 ratio and partly in deposit. Holders of stablecoins will be offered a claim at any time and free of charge by the issuer. For increased regulatory oversight, the proposed MiCA will ensure stablecoins are brought under the purview of the European Banking Authority (EBA). Before an issuer can operate, it must be present within the EU."
"231",1190,2022-07-01,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Colin Crossman, a corporate attorney and entrepreneur.  The Case  On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court of the United States issued an opinion in the case . This decision, which found that the EPA exceeded its authority, will have wide-ranging benefits for Bitcoin.1  At first glance, this appears to be a case related to the Clean Air Act, and the EPA’s ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. And if that’s all it was about, it would be a good result. The EPA was stopped from implementing a plan that would have massively increased the costs of operating fossil fuel energy plants. Specifically, the EPA’s  was to use its regulatory power to shift the entire energy mix of the United States from 38% coal to 27% by 2030.  Fundamentally, the EPA was trying to use an “obscure, never-used section of the law” (Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act), as a general “permission slip” to recalibrate the power mix of the entire country.2 The large amount of procedural posturing aside, the fundamental question the Court faced was whether or not Congress intended Section 111 of the Clean Air Act to grant the EPA the extraordinary power that it wished to use.  Had it issued a less sweeping edict, the EPA likely would have succeeded in making its rules stick. However, the Court has previously held that for certain major questions, where there are “extraordinary cases” of “economic and political significance,” an administrative agency cannot simply conclude that “Congress meant to confer such authority” when the law does not explicitly and clearly provide for it.3 The Court concluded that such a broad restructuring of the country’s energy economy, especially using such an obscure and unused provision, qualified as that kind of major question.4  “Capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that will force a nationwide transition away from the use of coal to generate electricity may be a sensible solution to the crisis of the day. But it is not plausible that Congress gave EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme in Section 111(d). A decision of such magnitude and consequence rests with Congress itself, or an agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.”5  Impact On Bitcoin  The benefits to the Bitcoin mining industry seem clear: the EPA has been stopped from implementing a regulation that arguably would have had negative impacts on miners’ ability to obtain inexpensive power. In addition, further regulation along the path the EPA was taking could have reached into the uses of power, impacting miners’ freedom to operate. That specific policy was stopped cold here.  But, in a broader sense, the EPA being unable to unilaterally use its authority to modify the country’s energy mix, the invigoration of the major question doctrine is a much bigger deal. This can potentially be used whenever an administrative agency (such as the SEC, OCC, CFTC, the IRS and Treasury more broadly, etc.) seeks to expand its authority, without “clear congressional authorization.”6 Of course, whether or not a specific instance of agency overreach will be seen by the Court as an “extraordinary case” where they will apply the major question doctrine, remains open to question and hence much further litigation.  What this does mean is that if an administrative agency attempts to extend their authority over Bitcoin in an unprecedented manner, without clear Congressional authorization, those affected should consider whether or not they can make an argument under this rationale (in addition to whatever other arguments they have). This is especially true if the new regulation by the agency can be shown to have broader effects than just on Bitcoin itself; given the global significance of Bitcoin, I believe such arguments should be tried even if no such broader effects are present.  Final Thoughts  While it is not mentioned anywhere in this decision, today’s decision can be seen as another step towards finally reversing the terrible doctrine known as Chevron deference.7 Chevron deference essentially gives administrative agencies a pass when interpreting ambiguity in their enabling statutes.8 This doctrine has made it nearly impossible in most circumstances to challenge a government agency’s interpretation or rulings or to hold them accountable to a reasonable standard when making determinations. For example, if a ditch has run-off in it after a large rainstorm, and the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers decide to label it “navigable waters” in order to assert their jurisdiction over it, the affected property owner has no real prospect of overturning that absurd designation, thanks to Chevron deference.9 This near-total lack of democratic accountability has been a significant factor in the insane growth of the administrative state since the early 1980s.  Justice Gorsuch once observed that, if the Supreme Court were to overrule Chevron, “[t]he only difference would be that courts would then fulfill their duty to exercise their independent judgment about what the law is.”10 Yet that comparatively small legal difference will ultimately make a huge difference to everyday Americans, who will once again be able to hold their government to account for its decisions. The sooner the court abandons Chevron and forces both Congress and the administrative state to return to their proper duties, the better.11  Footnotes  1: In the interest of time and space, this is an extremely concise overview, which leaves out a ton of detail.

"233",500,2022-07-01,"CryptoDaily","The European Parliament and the Council Presidency have agreed upon landmark crypto regulation, with negotiations resulting in the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) proposal, which will provide clear rules for crypto issuers, and focuses heavily on the regulation of stablecoins.  EU officials structured the MiCA proposal after negotiations took place in Brussels on Thursday, with the aim of increasing the regulatory purview of cryptocurrencies in Europe, particularly stablecoins and crypto asset issuers.  The press release outlining the negotiations of the MiCA agreement has set out the structuring of a register of non-compliant CASPs, specifically “those operating in the EU without authorisation or those who bypass the regulation.” The register set out in the proposal would enable authorities to shut down non-compliant CASPs and support efforts to support data protection and fight money laundering.  The European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs drafted the MiCA regulation package in April after ​​the first proposal to introduce MiCA in September 2020. The MiCA proposal is the first comprehensive regulation of digital assets in Europe.  Ernest Urtasun, Greens/EFA Vice President and Shadow Rapporteur on the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation, noted:  “MiCA will be the first comprehensive regime for crypto-assets in the world and will contain strong measures to guard against market abuse and manipulation. The crypto sphere is rife with risk and open to abuse and attack. We want to ensure that investors will have guarantees of protection for their assets and privacy, and that we avoid cases like the recent crypto-crash with retail investors losing all their money because of badly designed products or scams. Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) operating in the EU will now be subject to EU rules.""  Stefan Berger, a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), was the lawmaker who led negotiations on behalf of the European Parliament strongly opposed a ban on proof-of-work (PoW)-based assets such as Bitcoin during the negotiations, and was the representative appointed to report on the outcome of the proposed bill:  “Today, we put order in the Wild West of crypto assets and set clear rules for a harmonized market that will provide legal certainty for crypto asset issuers, guarantee equal rights for service providers and ensure high standards for consumers and investors,”  In line with the newly agreed upon rules, stablecoins will be required to maintain sufficient reserves to support mass withdrawals, and they will also face a cap, limited to 200 million euros in transactions per day. In addition, The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) will be given additional powers to restrict or ban crypto platforms that do not protect their investors.  The proposal will also address environmental concerns of cryptocurrency, with crypto issuers being required to declare their environmental and climate footprint.

"234",753,2022-07-01,"Cryptonews.com","After the EU has reached an agreement on cryptoasset regulation that sets out strict rules for all actors in the crypto market, the crypto industry reminds itself that there's still ""more work to be done.""  Rebecca Rettig, the general counsel for decentralized finance (  ) platform  and a board director at the crypto-friendly Silvergate Bank, applauded the effort to “provide clarity in the crypto space,” which she  they have been “requesting for years. But more work to be done.”  She went on to say that given how DeFi will be on the EU’s radar next, the DeFi sector now needs to make sure policymakers understand the technology and the fact that DeFi “must be regulated differently” than centralized crypto actors.  “As the EU delves into DeFi we will collaborate with policymakers to ensure there is a safe & robust system for users while making space for continued innovation in the  world,” Rettig added.  Meanwhile, the new rules constitute a provisional agreement on the long-awaited Markets in Crypto-assets (  ) regulatory framework, and hold so-called cryptoasset service providers (CASPs) liable to a much higher degree than before.  Commenting on the agreement, Bruno Le Maire, French Minister for the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty, said that the new regulation “will put an end to the crypto wild west,” while confirming the EU's role as “a standard-setter for digital topics.”  Among the requirements that will be placed on CASPs under the new rules is legal liability for the companies if they lose their clients’ cryptoassets. The rule covers all centralized companies in the crypto space, including wallet providers of ‘hosted’ or custodial wallets, but not so-called ‘unhosted wallets’, or just regular, private wallets, controlled by their users.  In addition to rules on wallets, the new regulations also impose new requirements designed to prevent “market manipulation and insider dealing,” the announcement said.  Further, the rules went into detail on the “environmental and climate footprint” of various actors in the cryptoasset market. These actors will in the future be required to declare information related to their environmental impact, in line with technical standards that will be developed by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).  The announcement added that the European Commission within two years will publish a report on the environmental impact of cryptoassets, as well as introduce “mandatory minimum sustainability standards” for consensus mechanisms such as proof-of-work (  ).  Moreover, the newly reached agreement says that the European Banking Authority (EBA) will be tasked with keeping an up-to-date list of all service providers who do not comply with the EU’s rules.  For service providers whose parent company is located in the countries that the EU considers at high risk for money laundering, or in the countries on the EU’s list of “non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes,” additional measures will be taken. This includes “enhanced checks” in line with the EU’s anti-money laundering framework.  Compliant stablecoins  For stablecoins, the new regulations state that only fully backed stablecoins will be compliant, and that holders must be able to redeem the coin at a 1:1 ratio “at any time and free of charge by the issuer.”  It added that all stablecoins will fall under the supervision of the European Banking Authority.  A physical presence of the stablecoin issuer in the EU will be a “precondition for any issuance.”  Meanwhile, commenting ahead of Thursday’s announcement, Philipp Pieper, the co-founder of the DeFi infrastructure provider Swarm said in an emailed comment to Cryptonews.com ahead of the decision that the new rules are expected to hit stablecoins particularly hard.  Stablecoins are “in the firing line,” Pieper said, correctly predicting that there would be “some fairly heavy-duty new rules coming in relating to registration and issuance.”  Excluded NFTs  The announcement said that non-fungible tokens (  ) are “excluded from the scope except if they fall under existing crypto-asset categories.”  It added that further regulations covering the NFT market will be proposed by the European Commission “if deemed necessary.”  Subject to approval  The new rules are still subject to the approval of the European Council and European Parliament before going into force.  They come in addition to the Transfer of Funds Regulation (TFR) that was , which covered the traceability of crypto transfers and rules relating to the so-called ‘unhosted wallets’.  ____"

"236",1168,2022-06-29,"Bitcoin Magazine","This is an opinion editorial by Marie Poteriaieva, a Ukrainian-French crypto industry observer and educator, following the space since 2016.  Bitcoin is routinely treated as an  : its  is quite simple to track and  as “anti-ecological.” This statement is wrong on many levels, but public opinion is rarely nuanced, and politicians often have little to lose by attacking Bitcoin on ecological grounds — at a (comparatively) small expense of alienating crypto enthusiasts they can position themselves as planet-saviors to a larger audience.  This approach won’t last long though. More and more voices are rising to contest this immature presentation of Bitcoin, its mining, and its importance for the world. These arguments go in three main directions:  - Energy consumption of Bitcoin versus the traditional monetary system it is intended to replace.  - Green mining and its potential to boost green energy development around the world.  - Multi-purpose use of miners, recycling their waste heat or capturing flare gas.  Fiat System Energy Consumption  The notion of “a lot” only makes sense in comparison. In the case of Bitcoin energy consumption, the most relevant comparison is with the fiat money system (and not with some small European country, as some clickbait articles may quote).  While Bitcoin is pretty much self-sufficient, in the fiat world its job is done by a plethora of different organizations in charge of issuance, distribution, management, bookkeeping and payment services.  A , an asset management firm specializing in cryptocurrencies, looked deeply at only four metrics of the fiat world — branches, servers, ATMs and card networks' data centers — and estimated that the banking system consumes over 263 TWh yearly.  More detailed research,  by Michel Khazzaka of the Paris-based consultancy Valuechain Technology Ltd., combs through the energy consumption of more aspects of fiat money: the printing and minting of physical notes and coins, ATMs, cash in transit, cash at electronic points-of-sale, card payments, banking offices, banking employees’ commutes, banking IT and inter-banking. The results are stunning: the traditional money sector — excluding finance and insurance — would consume around 4,981 TWh yearly.  Bitcoin Energy Consumption  Bitcoin network hash rate — the collective computational effort miners are deploying to mine a block — is public information, which makes it possible to calculate Bitcoin electricity consumption by estimating how much energy is needed to produce it.  The most popular resource on Bitcoin energy consumption is the  (CBECI), which estimates electricity use by “simplistic weighting of profitable hardware,” a method relying heavily on electricity cost estimate and is thus not particularly accurate. CBECI currently estimates Bitcoin yearly energy use at 120 TWh.  The above-mentioned study by Valuechain proposes a different methodology: counting miner nodes and their efficiency, i.e., watts consumed per hash and the release date of each miner (assuming that non-ASIC mining is marginal and should not be taken into account anymore). This method gives another figure of 88.95 TWh.  Bitcoin is thus estimated to consume 2-56 times less energy than the fiat system it is an alternative to.  Bitcoin As A Way To Greener Energy  A number of studies, such as those conducted by the , have pointed out that the exceptionally high percentage of renewables in the Bitcoin energy mix — 58% — is considerably more than any other major industry.  This is not surprising, for Bitcoin miners are mobile, and they naturally go where the energy is cheapest — which in many cases means going to green energy sources that cannot efficiently stock and transport their extra energy.  Bitcoin mining is also flexible, meaning that a miner could be turned on and off instantaneously following energy fluctuations, which in case of green energy can be considerable.  These two qualities allow Bitcoin mining farms to be installed in some of the world’s most remote places, like a dam on the Amazon or a solar farm in West Texas, making them more profitable and incentivizing more green energy developments.  Good examples of such incentive alignment would include  built on the edges of Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The initial investments were enough to build the plants, but not enough to get electricity to people, who continued using charcoal and cutting trees in Virunga, precipitating its deforestation … until a Bitcoin mining company from Paris came. Now based in Switzerland,  has installed mining rigs on the dams, making them profitable and allowing them to finance the rest of operations, including the necessary infrastructure.  Carbon-Neutral And Carbon-Negative Mining  Miners are subject to constant innovation, not only in the size of their chips (smaller chips equal less energy required to transmit data), but also in technologies allowing them to capture and repurpose the waste heat they generate, making mining de facto carbon-neutral.  Canadian MintGreen  to warm water for a whiskey distillery, and  to heat buildings in Vancouver is underway. Norwegian Kryptovault recycles the waste heat to dry timber, and soon — seaweed. Sweden’s Genesis Mining uses its miners to heat up greenhouses. Similar initiatives are popping up all over the world, and projects like The Block’s “custom silicon” rigs will only increase the number of ways a Bitcoin miner can be used.  What’s more, Bitcoin mining can be carbon-negative, i.e., effectively reducing the quantity of greenhouse gasses emitted into the atmosphere. It can do so by capturing flared gas — a by-product of oil production, which is often too expensive to transport, so it is simply flared into the atmosphere, emitting harmful air pollutants like black carbon, methane and volatile organic compounds. Oil producers all over the world are being increasingly told to curb the gas flaring, and Bitcoin mining is a clever way to do it.  Some smaller oil producers in Texas and Montana have already partnered with mining companies to capture the flared gas, but it was the arrival of  that has definitely put this practice on the map.  Humanity needs energy to live and to develop, and instead of trying to curb its use, bringing us back to candlelight, we should aim to develop energy efficiency and sustainability.  Bitcoin uses 2-56 times less energy than the fiat system, and the Lightning Network can allow it to scale as needed without spending much more.  Bitcoin mining is already the greenest industry, and it can incentivize many more green energy developments around the world.  Bitcoin miners can also be used for a number of non-mining endeavors, including actually preventing more greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere.  Now it’s the fiat system’s turn to justify its ecological footprint.  This is a guest post by Marie Poteriaieva.

"237",668,2022-06-29,"Cryptonews.com","The authors of a new report claim that  is “ready” for use in the world of business – albeit with “some caveats.”  The  was compiled by the Ethereum Enterprise Alliance (EEA) – a business-focused affiliate of the Ethereum Foundation. Its authors claimed that while the “pieces are in place” for “the safe and productive use of Ethereum as a business platform,” the aforementioned pieces do not yet “necessarily fit together seamlessly.”  In a press release, the EEA’s Executive Director Dan Burnett was  as stating that the body’s “analysis and examples” showed that “the pieces are now in place in the Ethereum ecosystem for the safe and productive use of this technology as a business platform.”  The report’s authors, who provided a number of case studies to back up their claims, wrote that Ethereum was a “safe and productive” business platform that has “matured greatly” and was now a “battle-tested and “globally significant settlement layer.”  They explained that the “important thing for businesses to keep in mind in this context is that Ethereum is a complete ecosystem,” writing:  “Compared to its early days, there is a rich assortment of standards, tools, providers, and platforms that businesses can turn to.”  In addition to the mainnet,  and  (L2) solutions help provide the “sustainability, performance, and privacy” that some companies will likely hanker after.  Although they conceded that the “regulatory environment for digital assets and blockchain technology (as opposed to cryptocurrencies)” was still far from stable “in many respects,” they claimed that this “need not be seen as a blocker.” They added that “many jurisdictions” now “see the potential of blockchain and look favorably on it.”  While all the ingredients are in the kitchen, though, no chef has yet managed to blend them together, the authors indicated. Critics have often claimed that Ethereum suffers from scalability problems.  The authors admitted that scaling solutions and other tools are “relatively new, and carry the risks associated with any new technology or platform.”  They also mentioned the issue of interoperability, admitting that the world was “yet to see the rise to prominence of comprehensive development and deployment suites that are often to be found in more mature technologies and that can be used to seamlessly bind all the pieces together into a whole.”  But, they claimed, developers were aware of this issue. The authors asserted that the situation on this front would “improve over time.”  What Ethereum can offer its users, the authors continued, is flexibility – in the form of multiple “options for setups based on business type and needs.”  For instance, they explained that while the Ethereum mainnet “scores high on usability and interoperability for tokenization,” projects that require high levels of performance and regulatory compliance might prefer to work with Layer 2 solutions or sidechains – or even build an Ethereum-based private network.  In the payments sphere, too, the authors claimed that moving away from the mainnet could provide solutions for “high-volume use cases,” including retail, or industries “where privacy and regulatory compliance are high priorities” such as the financial services sector. Again, this would allow businesses who “rely on L2s or sidechains to reduce network costs and gain scalability.”  They wrote:  “In its early days, Ethereum promised to support decentralized business and collaboration through, among other things, tokenization and smart contracts. Today, this promise is becoming a reality.”  Furthermore, they claimed that there was no shortage of incentives for companies to “explore” Ethereum-based decentralized business models and “processes of the type Ethereum makes possible.”  They claimed that tokenization and smart contracts allow digital assets to be “uniquely and verifiably represented.” Smart contracts, they argued, mean that “agreements about these digital assets can be programmed, validated, and executed by machines more quickly and accurately and cost-effectively than by humans alone.”  This, they said, would allow companies to slash overheads, as well as develop new “cost-effective” products and services.  ____"

Hosted mining allows these individuals to utilize outside facilities, opening up mining opportunities to the broader public.  “We’re building a full suite of products and services for miners at Luxor, and the hosting marketplace is a crucial piece of the full-stack we are building,” Foster said. “Now miners can buy, host, and mine all in one place with Luxor’s services.”"

The WTO successfully concluded the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in Geneva on 17 June, confirming multilaterally negotiated outcomes on a series of key trade initiatives, the so-called “Geneva Package”. This multilateral consensus confirms the historical importance of the multilateral trading system, and better underlines the essential function of the WTO in solving the world’s most urgent challenges, especially at a time when mankind is still confronting with the on-going COVID 19 and UKRAINE war.  The Geneva Package is expected to play a new role to solve problems, mainly including the most pressing issues such as: the Emergency Response to Food Insecurity, the WTO Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Preparedness for Future Pandemics, and a Decision on the e-commerce  Moratorium and Work Program.  Justin Sun, a 30-ish entrepreneur on digital economy, is surely keen to the WTO’s decision on the e-commerce which is also his cause for life.  Justin Sun successfully established a crypto currency platform, TRON, a couple of years ago. This fruitful period had granted him plenty of experience and expertise on digitalized solutions. Therefore, his speech and attitude are for sure block chain-oriented.  He had harvested a lot and is able to deliver more given his new career urges him to do so. Justin sun got political since last December. He had convinced a lot people to help with his agenda, literally the same agenda as the WTO called on.  As per the MC12 agenda, Justin Sun had set out a series of solutions and attitudes to help with poverty alleviation, environmental protection, climate change and efficient attribution of food supply to some poorest countries. Justin Sun believes that all solutions could be connected with a block chain approach. He had extended the concept of block chain on the international forum, and called on more attentions.  “Digitalized economy and social lifestyle may ease the pains by COVID 19 and UKRAINE war” Justin Sun formally proposed such solutions based on his past experience and expertise on the forum. A great proportion of representatives of the WTO members shared Justin Sun’s ideology and philosophy.  On behalf of Grenada, he then pointed out that beneficial outcomes on e-commerce must be protected by relevant stakeholders. He chose to close the digital divide among countries, which may lead to higher levels of investment in infrastructure; modernization of the legal and regulatory framework; and training and capacity building among others. It is in this context that Justin Sun and his country Grenada support the renewal of the e-commerce Work Program, including the development dimension, and a renewal of the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions.

Aspen said its mining operation is co-located at a solar farm that has a capacity of 10 megawatts. While the miner intends to begin with Bitcoin mining at its data centre, it plans to eventually provide computing services to other businesses.  The Colorado data centre will run S19 Bitcoin mining machines and be co-located with a 75,000-square-foot research-and-development centre and fulfilment facility, Aspen said. The facility will serve as centralized testing, maintenance, storage and training hub for the company's computing infrastructure.  Founded in January, Aspen is entering the industry at a time when existing miners are facing difficulty to remain profitable with the current plunge in crypto prices.  Alexandra DaCosta, CEO of Aspen Creek Digital Corporation, commented: ""Recent market volatility has demonstrated the importance of our core strategy: controlling power as the principal input in bitcoin mining. The success of our first project is proof of our concept to substantially lower the cost of energy, the single largest input for bitcoin mining, and to do it sustainably. Our talented team and partners will dramatically improve the sustainability of the industry while building strong partnerships with local communities, delivering carbon transparency, and enhancing grid resiliency.""  Galaxy Digital a crypto-focused financial services firm was delighted by Aspen's solar power project and management team, and therefore accepted to collaborate with the miner. As a result, Aspen said it has hosted some of Galaxy's own miners at its Colorado site.  Besides that, Aspen stated it is building its second Bitcoin mining facility in Texas. The mining site, which is set to be operational this summer, is a 30-MW data centre with the capacity to host 10,000 ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners co-located behind-the-meter with an 87-MW solar farm. Aspen also said it is developing its third mining centre elsewhere in another site in Texas the 150-MW data centre co-located behind-the-meter, with a 200-MW solar farm.

"243",788,2022-06-27,"CryptoDaily","The utility of a token is an essential aspect that crypto project developers must consider before releasing a new cryptocurrency into the coin market. Unfortunately, many tokens have failed to live up to expectations due to a lack of real-life application or valuable use cases attached to the project.  Tokens with no utility are hardly adopted, and when the potential for adopting a coin is low, its run in the crypto market will be short-lived. Such is the case of early meme tokens like Safemoon and Dogecoin. On the other hand, CashFi (CFI), a new meme token that'll soon be launched, took a cue from past failed meme coins to avoid being short-lived like others.  Cronos (CRO) is a more established coin that's still relevant in the market due to its utility. Projects with significant use cases are sustainable. Beyond sustainability, they have high adoption potential, contributing to market success. We review our case studies below:  Cronos (CRO) Paves The Way  Cronos (CRO) is a decentralized blockchain-based platform created in 2016 to provide greater utility to users of Crypto.com — a payment, finance, and trading services platform. Cronos chain is Ethereum-compatible, and it utilizes a proof-of-authority consensus mechanism to ensure the proper functionality and security of its platform.  The network allows users to transfer/port decentralized Apps (dApps) built on Ethereum-blockchain to its ecosystem. Thanks to its compatibility with the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). Cronos chain has incentive mechanisms for the community. It rewards holders that stake their tokens and offers cashback percent on vendor payments and gift card purchases.  It enhances peer-2-peer transfer among users, providing a highly efficient and swift transaction. Cronos chain improves Defi, allows creators to transfer dApps to its network, and ensures a low-cost and high-speed transaction. Cronos chain utility token is called ""Cronos Token (CRO). It powers the ecosystem, can be used as a transaction fee and helps users earn rewards.  Cronos (CRO) token currently ranks amongst the top 25 cryptocurrencies on Coinmarketcap, with a market app of $2.8 million. It reached an all-time high of $0.9698 in 2021 but has since declined to the current market price of $0.1+. The bear market rally could be one of the reasons for the price increase.  Experts believe that Cronos (CRO) token has great profit potential. In addition, it sells at a relatively low price and boasts great utility in decentralized finance. These factors make it likely for the coin to perform better in the coming days.  Introducing CashFi (CFI)  CashFi (CFI) is a scalable and decentralized blockchain-based platform developed with strong utility and application in asset management, including liquid staking, NFTs, synthetics, and cryptocurrencies. It is widely regarded as the next generation for liquid staking, and it enables users/investors to assess assets through a fee-sharing model.  CashFi (CFI) uses the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism for optimal functionality of the ecosystem. It aims to unite the blockchain ecosystem to provide fast-paced, scalable, and cost-effective services. CFI offers off-chain, on-chain, and multi-chain operability with a Web3 framework.  It aims to seamlessly provide a cross-chain NFTs marketplace and a creator's center for minting Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) at a reduced fee while promoting transparent and secure peer-to-peer (P2P) interactions by removing any centralized requirements in the NFTs marketplace.  CashFi token (CFI) is the platform's utility token with uses beyond staking. It will be used in the NFT marketplace for minting, purchases, and other transactional needs on the platform. CFI is set to revolutionize the NFT market by leveraging the blockchain ecosystem. This use case makes it highly adoptable upon launching. The native token of the platform will become a necessary purchase for everyone who intends to leverage the platform to mint or purchase NFTs on any platform. This guarantees the sustainability of the token.  The Bottom Line  The utility determines how adoptable a project would be in the early days. It also determines the sustainability of the project moving forward. Projects with great use cases always make a great long-term investment. The CFI token is currently available and on presale, and it will be beneficial to get in early.

"244",1331,2022-06-26,"Cryptonews.com","Sergey Vasylchuk is the Co-founder & CEO of the staking provider .  ______  As  sunk below the USD 20,000 mark, the panicking voices filled with eschatological fervor seemed to come from around the community. The same USD 20,000 mark that five years ago looked like a pinnacle of cryptocurrency success is now a grim gravestone sitting comfortably over the crumbling pipe dreams of Lambos, luxury yachts, and gambling sprees in Monte Carlo.  This is the very thing that is wrong with this sort of thinking. Those who think of Lambos and Manhattan penthouses will always be on the losing side, no matter what market they live through. To stay in crypto, you must act like a tough entrepreneur in a highly volatile market and think about creating value for the ecosystem, not consuming it.  Market conditions  The market is going through yet another recession, crypto winter, downturn — you name it. Anyone with the slightest idea of risk management knew for a fact that it would happen sooner or later. The bear market always comes after bull markets and vice versa. This is as inevitable as a sunrise.  But was everyone prepared for that? No. There was no proper risk management on the part of too many people and organizations. There are always risks; accepting them means getting ready to see them become a reality.  Let’s take , a lending and borrowing platform that operated on the failed  platform. Too many people were mesmerized by their magical 20% offer ignoring the question of where the liquidity would come from, and never thought about the possibility of an economic attack on the protocol, which eventually happened.  They suffered severe punishment for letting pipe dreams take over their rational thinking.  Those folks on the bull market thought it would be forever as long as new people came along. Have they even thought about how we call business models based solely on the supply of new participants? Or that this supply cannot be endless, and that’s why such business models we know as pyramids or Ponzi schemes always crumble? That’s another example of daydreaming that, I believe, has no place in the market.  The so-called market downturn hardly affects people who build and run their businesses with a complete account of profits, expenditures, and risk assessment. Of course, there was some impact, but I believe we should treat all those events in a neutral or even positive way.  Why market crash is good for the ecosystem  I can hear some of you asking: what’s so positive about people losing lots of money or even jobs? Well, there are many reasons to be optimistic.  Market crashes sober people up. It sobers up those who came to the market looking for a quick buck from speculating or pumping. It sobers up those who live for expectations and pipe dreams. Nearly 75% of the market seems to consist of players of this sort. And this kind of behavior is punishable by reality.  This downtrend happened precisely because people preferred expectations to real life. If 75% of the market expects it to crumble, it will crumble.  That’s how markets work: they just comply with whatever people expect of them. So, first, there allegedly was an economic attack on Anchor where it looked like some cynical whales pocketed nearly a billion from poorly educated lemmings or people with excessive risk appetites.  Those losses dragged dependent businesses down to the grave. At the same time,  found itself ears-deep in the bog because of regulatory attention and risky statements. People panicked out of expectations of loss and started selling , which threw the ETH staking market into unrest and upheaval. And there we go—a panic sale.  But again, what’s so positive about it? In a word, this is the natural process of the market getting rid of inefficient players.  It is they who made the market the way it was, so it is the market they deserve in the first place. Those who faint looking at bitcoin price charts have no right to stay in the market. If you start working with crypto, you must ready yourself for downtrends and market downturns, just as you should be prepared to have your leg broken if you are serious about skydiving. If you are not serious about it, frankly, you shouldn’t get into it in the first place.  This downturn drives useless profiteers away. It drives away those who got lucky to make some money but then proclaimed themselves financial messiahs and gurus. It will kill off startups that build their businesses on an endless streak of grants instead of sound business models. This will cause programmers to join real projects with a steady economy, risk management, and true sustainability.  The market will grow again and crash again, and it will be happening over and over again. But with each iteration, there will be more and more efficient businesses serious about making a change, not making a quick buck.  So, if you are serious and prepared, you’ll survive and eventually thrive. If you are not, then what can I say. Serves you right.  Errors are not wrong  I’m not claiming to be right all the time, of course. Nobody’s perfect, and we had our share of failures, all stemming from wrong decisions. But to err is human, and there isn’t a single company that has never made a grave mistake, not just in crypto but in the entire global economy. The trick is not to avoid errors but to make more correct decisions than erroneous ones. That’s what risk management is all about.  It is mathematically proven that those who make many mistakes are more likely to succeed through the sheer number of going through the cycle of erring/learning/drawing conclusions. As long as you are correct more often than you are wrong, your growth will remain steady—an effect known as an anti-hook.  So, of course, I admit to making a lot of wrong decisions. We made too risky investments for our risk appetites. Still, the strategy of expanding the number of blockchains with Everstake presence was the correct one. The mistakes were mainly about the choice of particular blockchains.  One of the most idiotic errors that comes to mind in this regard is the negligence some of us treated  tokens back at the project’s dawn. I told everyone that Solana would be the next big thing, but nobody took it seriously. Still, we got many tokens when we entered their ecosystem and launched a testnet. But since there was this negligent attitude, especially considering the symbolic price of each Solana token back in the day, some tokens were just lost. Others were sold at around USD 1 to cover some testnet expenses. Needless to say, it turned out to be one of the most remarkable instances of lucrum seccans, or lost profit, in my career.  But what is the lesson here? There are two, actually. The first one is that errors are inevitable. The second is that you will survive and even thrive no matter what mistakes you make if your strategy and risk management are sound.  Conclusion  If I were to draw a line under all this, it would be a classic rock quote: don’t fear the reaper. The market will be better off without the high-risk futility brought about by daydreamers, and it will become more robust than before. Seasons change, and crypto winter will inevitably become a crypto spring, followed by a proper crypto summer.  Crypto is not a scam or a pyramid. It has undergone several cycles of upturns and downturns and always ended up stronger and more attractive than before. And it will happen again and again.  Just don’t you forget about proper risk management.  _____"
"245",611,2022-06-20,"Blockchain.News","Sustainable finance company Likvidi on Thursday announced a strategic investment and partnership deal with Israeli startup Albo Climate.  Through the partnership, the two firms have launched Veriforest', a new global digital registry forestry platform, to enable small and medium-sized projects to access the carbon offset markets.  The carbon credit market has been inaccessible to such landowners due to high transaction, monitoring, and reporting costs that have discouraged their participation.  The global digital registry forestry platform, therefore, removes barriers preventing small landowners and midsize forest administrators from accessing the carbon offset markets. The platform will make it possible for millions of such landowners to commit themselves to sustaining their land's legacy for future generations.  Albo Climate applies AI to satellite imagery to map, measure, and monitor carbon sequestration and scale-up carbon removal.  Agriculture and forestry activities are sources of GHG emissions. The good news is that forest landowners can generate carbon offsets through new afforestation, and reforestation projects, among others. This ensures that land use has a positive impact on livelihoods, food supply, the economy, environmental restoration, development goals, and climate targets.  To do this, Likvidi and Albo have launched the global technology-enabled platform for carbon sequestration (removal). This global platform provides entry to the international carbon market for small-scale forest landowners who are realizing agroforestry projects for carbon sequestration through biomass growth, majorly through trees, which is measured with the help of satellite monitoring.  The platform supports the initiation and development of such agroforestry projects and facilitates the subsequent trade of the so-called carbon removal units (CRUs)' that are generated from the sequestered carbon.  The launch of the new platform is set to enable landowners to get a real-time value assessment of how much income their forest properties could generate in the voluntary carbon market.  Landowners who choose to enrol their forest or land properties on the digital registry platform would lock in multi-year payments for the resulting carbon offsets from buyers seeking to offset carbon emissions. There is no cost to landowners to use the digital platform.  Veriforest combines blockchain with Albo's satellite and AI capabilities to accurately monitor the carbon sequestration of forestland which will make carbon credits more tangible than ever before.  Veriforest has therefore created an end-to-end solution that offers tokenized carbon credits for offset to individuals and firms.  The new partnership means that forested areas can now be quickly and accurately assessed for carbon storage and credit issuance and logged in the Veriforest registry platform. The Veriforest solution can scale to meet the massive demand for measurements of carbon-related data and can bring carbon credits to market faster than existing traditional methods.  Albo Climate CEO Dr Jacques Amselem talked about the development and said: It's a pleasure to work with our fellow passionate technologists at Likvidi and to be able to bring our satellite imagery analysis products to enhance the Veriforest solution that Likvidi is building. We look forward to years of partnership ahead.  Israeli startup Albo Climate has built a revolutionary technology for the estimation of carbon stocks and sequestration. It's AI technology uses proprietary Deep Learning algorithms to analyze satellite imagery and validate carbon credits for forestry projects anywhere across the world. Satellite-mounted sensors are able to scan vegetation and pick up information not visible to the naked eye.  Albo's technology uses AI (artificial intelligence) and ground truth datasets to produce an in-depth profile of carbon storage over a huge area. The analysis has applications for both small- and large-scale projects."

"249",533,2022-06-06,"Blockchain.News","Oman Investment Authority disclosed on Wednesday that it bought an equity stake in Crusoe Energy Systems Inc.  Crusoe is a U.S software firm based in Denver whose mission is to help the oil industry reduce routine flaring of natural gas.  In April, Oman's sovereign wealth fund participated in the $350 million equity round that Crusoe Energy Systems Inc. raised.  Chase Lochmiller, the CEO and Co-founder at Crusoe Energy Systems Inc., said that Crusoe would open an office in Muscat, Oman, to help deploy mining equipment and power generators for capturing gas at well sites.  The ME region (the Middle East and North Africa region) accounts for about 38% of the world's gas flaring the burning of excess natural gas from oil fields. The practice has faced increased scrutiny for worsening climate change and releasing harmful greenhouse gases.  We've always felt it was important for us to have a presence in the ME region, given its share of global flaring. Having the buy-in from nations that are actively trying to solve the flaring issues is what we are looking for, Lochmiller stated.  According to the report, Crusoe held a workshop in Oman on Monday with the country's biggest oil producers, including OQ SAOC and Petroleum Development Oman.  Lochmiller disclosed that the first Middle East pilot will be launched by year-end or early 2023. Although the drop in Bitcoin prices certainly impacts our top-line revenue, it doesn't impact any plans for growth and expansion, the executive stated.  Crusoe uses excess natural gas from energy operations to power data centres and crypto mining operations. The firm, which keeps all coins it mines, focuses on creating shops in remote areas where it's not economically feasible to build infrastructure to cut gas flaring.  Ismail Ibrahim Al-Harthi, senior manager of technology investments at Oman Investment Authority, said that in the past, the Oman government signed an agreement with the World Bank's initiative to end routine flaring by 2030. Al-Harthi further disclosed that the Oman government invested in Crusoe early last year, then increased that stake with the April round.  Oman is committed to reducing greenhouse gases in line with the Paris climate agreement, Al-Harthi said.  Crypto Climate Impact Under New Scrutiny  Cryptocurrency has  for being energy-intensive and reliant on burning natural gas. Crypto mining is considered an energy-intensive actitivities, and in most cases, fossil fuels are burned to create that electricity, contributing to global warming.  The use of flare gas to mine cryptocurrency has been regarded as a win-win solution, which means less natural gas is wasted, and crypto mining is not burning extra fossil fuels.  Some oil and gas companies, such as , have been working with Crusoe Energy Systems Inc. to turn wasted energy (flare gas) into electricity used to power thousands of crypto miners.  However, the process is under environmental scrutiny.

All of the paintings depict an interpretation of a local community- Sham Shui Po, and are now being sold as NFTs on Cathay's shopping platform - Cathay Shop - and Articoin's Proof-of-Capacity (PoC)2 Green NFT platform.  Josephine Leung, Executive Director at children's support concept The Hub Hong Kong, said, ""the emergence of blockchain and NFTs offers our charity work a new perspective and possibility. And we are grateful to have two highly-regarded partners and supporters to make this happen together. All net funds raised from the campaign will go to support the much-needed education and development programs for underprivileged children at The Hub Hong Kong.""  The energy source for minting these NFTs is environmentally friendly. Compared to the carbon footprint generated by traditional blockchain consensus algorithms, the Green NFT platform Articoin is backed by the more energy-friendly PoC mechanism, which reduces carbon emissions to a greater extent (2,600 times).  These NFTs have been released as limited editions, which can be bought with Asia Miles, cash or Miles Plus Cash on Cathay's shopping platform, Cathay Shop, and redeemed on Articoin. However, buyers can also purchase them directly through Articoin's platform by credit card and debit card.  Andy Wong, General Manager of Corporate Affairs at Cathay, said, ""through these NFTs, we hope to provide an innovative new way for people to lend their support to the incredible charitable work being done to help the vulnerable in our community."""

The Dubai based non-profit organization wants to raise funds by selling 10,000 generative non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and launching a new cryptocurrency.  The green startup plans to launch its token as a way to raise funds by crowdsourcing.  The company seeks to partner with 100 brands across the UAE and the Middle East with a sustainable product or solution. Whoever buys or owns the NFT would have discounts or benefits with these firms.  The aim of the company is to raise awareness and funds to build boats that clean up the oceans.  Oceans Us has progressed in talks to partner with various firms including the team behind the Qatar World Cup, the top UAE-based retailer Landmark Group, coffee brands that already have a mission to promote green practices, solar home solutions companies, and sustainable fashion brands, among others.  The startup said that it is closely working with Marakeb Technologies, a major tech firm based in the United Arab Emirates, to design autonomous, self-driven boats powered by AI that will clear plastic from oceans and rivers.  Marakeb Technologies is 30% owned by the Abu Dhabi government. The launch of the AI self-driven boats is scheduled to take place in July this year.  Joel Michael, the founder of Oceans Us, talked about the development and said that the partnership is mainly to bring together the community and bring art as a means of communication.  The executive stated: Sustainability is an ecosystem, and NFTs work as a gateway. Buying an NFT enables people to invest and participate in a hands-on way. The idea is for all of this to sit on the blockchain that is transparent so every single dollar invested can be seen clearly where it goes.  The biggest thing we want to solve is transporting plastic we collect back to land so it can be repurposed. Michael elaborated further.  He disclosed that since the government supports such initiatives, firms in the private markets are seen joining hands. Michael said: We have seen tremendous support from the UAE and think it's the epicentre of sustainability in the region.  Blockchain Paving the Way  The  was born out of the need to create something that was decentralized, immutable, transparent, and completely secure. Such characteristics echo what people look for when they hear the term social good.  This explains the reason why many firms are now looking at how they can use this technology to improve themselves while also helping others at the same time.  Overfishing and pollution have adversely affected marine biodiversity, while climate change threatens to increase the severity of diseases, storms, and other impacts.  Oceans Us is working with various partners to develop and scale blockchain projects to rid millions of tons of plastic that enter the world's oceans.  By supporting the firm, consumers help it progress towards its goal of cleaning up 90% of floating ocean plastic pollution."

Mairead noted the innovative nature of digital currencies as they can help sustain the financial ecosystem through their speed and tamper-proof nature. He also highlighted the technology's decentralised nature that has stirred the elimination of intermediaries that generally make financial transactions cumbersome.  Mairead observed that the recent  issued by President Joe Biden and the Markets in Crypto Assets (  ) pursuit by the European Union are commendable first steps towards regulating cryptocurrencies. Still, he noted that since crypto is a global movement, regulators' efforts are also meant to be global. He believes the US and the EU can champion this proposed global drive.  I believe that the EU and the U.S. can together lead the way on a shared international approach to regulating crypto. Together, we can enable innovation in finance, while protecting consumers and maintaining financial stability, he said in an OpEd published by The Hill.  Despite the innovative nature of cryptocurrencies as highlighted by Mairead, he did not turn a blind eye to the inherent risks associated , including environmental considerations. He noted that should global effort not be strengthened to regulate the space, investors will likely fall victim to bad projects that may swindle them of their cash.  In all, Mairead highlighted the exact aspects in which the two global powers can collaborate to make the nascent ecosystem acceptable and more efficient.  A global agreement on crypto should first enshrine that no product remains unregulated. Second, supervisors should collect and exchange information globally. Third, any agreement must protect retail investors. Fourth, the crypto ecosystem should fully integrate environmental considerations, he added.  There have been a lot of calls around the world for a combined effort to regulate crypto, seeing there is no border with the reach of digital assets. Whether or not this advice will be taken is yet to be seen by the core stakeholders to whom the appeal is made."

The move became necessary based on requests from its community of donors as detailed in an announcement shared by the Foundation.  The Wikimedia Foundation is an umbrella body for a group of platforms that adhere to the Wiki style of websites which permits editing from various internet users. Some of the branches within the company's body include Wikipedia, Wikibooks, Wikiversity, and Wikinews respectively.  The Wikimedia Foundation started accepting digital currencies for its donations back in 2014 at the behest of its community, and it said the decision to halt these forms of donation is based on months of discussion by the same community over the suitability of digital assets as donation assets for the platform.  The Wikimedia Foundation has decided to discontinue direct acceptance of cryptocurrency as a means of donating. We began our direct acceptance of cryptocurrency in 2014 based on requests from our volunteers and donor communities. We are making this decision based on recent feedback from those same communities, the announcement from the foundation reads.  As revealed, the implication of the move, according to the Wikimedia Foundation, is that it will be closing down its Bitpay account, a move that will take away its ability to directly accept cryptocurrency as a method of donating.  A number of critics have continued to talk down the environmental friendliness of digital currencies due to the high energy utilization and carbon footprint of Bitcoin (BTC) and other Proof of Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies. The Wikimedia Foundation's move to ban crypto donations was preceded by a related move from Mozilla, the tech firm in charge of the Firefox browser.  Mozilla Corporation also  on its acceptance of cryptocurrencies due to the environmental impact of the nascent asset class. The only difference between the Mozilla and Wikimedia Foundation's decisions is that the latter is open to further evolution in the crypto industry in the near future."

Fort Worth, a city in Texas State, announced Tuesday that it has become the first city to mine Bitcoin in the US.  The city, which is ranked the 12th largest and home to over 800,000 residents, said this initiative is a partnership with Texas Blockchain Council - a non-profit association made up of companies and individuals that work in Bitcoin, Bitcoin mining, crypto and blockchain industries.  In its , the city government said initially it will utilise three S9 Bitcoin mining machines, placing them in its city hall for the mining operations, which are donated by Texas Blockchain Council.

Parker believes the city would be positioning itself to be the capital of Bitcoin mining of Texas . The administration aims at becoming a leading hub for technology and innovation, according to the statement.  Yet, the process of Bitcoin mining is regarded as not environmental-friendly enough, as mining methods are usually based on Proof-of-Work (PoW), instead of Proof-of-Stake (PoS), and PoW is considered more energy-intensive, requiring more energy input which could be harmful to the environment. The government said, the city estimates each will consume the same amount of energy as a household vacuum cleaner, based on the number and type of machines being used, adding that the energy it uses for mining would be less: the nominal amount of energy needed for the program is expected to be offset by the value of Bitcoin mined. The programme would be evaluated after six months, according to the official information.  More enterprises are trying to put efforts into mining Bitcoin, for instance, U.S.-based energy operator ExxonMobil recently  a pilot programme to conduct Bitcoin mining by converting excess energy through the production of natural gas.

"267",1038,2022-04-27,"Brave New Coin","Although the launch of ApeSwap Treasury Bills was one of the most anticipated NFTs of Spring 2022, nobody could have predicted their immediate success.  When the  launched on April 12, 2022, the first batch sold out almost immediately after they became available. The ApeSwap community ensured the success of the limited-edition NFTs, with tremendous excitement for the next round.  Because of the early success and more to come, the ApeSwap team wanted to offer a look at how Treasury Bills became a blue chip NFT at launch, with a vision of the roadmap to come.  Why the Treasury Bill Presale was Successful  The launch of the Treasury Bill product was among the most heavily awaited events of the year for the ApeSwap community. Within minutes of launching, the discount turned negative  —  meaning the Treasury Bills price was higher than the price of BA  —  and purchases were disabled. As a result, ApeSwap community members wanted to know how Treasury Bills can become unavailable so quickly. The answer lies in tokenomics.  The key utility of the NFT is selling Liquidity Pool (LP) tokens and receiving BA tokens, which vest over a 14-day period. There are three key incentives for purchasing the Treasury Bill NFT: The unique art procedurally generated with each mint (more on that below), the ability to earn BA tokens at a discount, and generating protocol-owned liquidity for the ApeSwap DAO to build long-term sustainability for the product.  How the Discount Rate Works  As Treasury Bills are minted, the BA discount rate slowly decreases until it gets to (or below) 0%. This has two primary effects: First, a lower discount increases the return on emissions (ROE) for the entire protocol, adding inherent value to the BA token. Second, once the BA discount crosses 0% and goes negative, Treasury Bill purchases are disabled until the discount rate becomes positive again.    When , they will see the available LP combinations, the current price, and discount against the current BA market rate. If the discount is in the red, then it is currently at a negative rate and the buttons will read “Available Soon.” This acts as a countdown for buyers to look forward to the next release. Once the discount rate goes above 0%, the NFT — along with the earning utility from purchasing Treasury Bills with LP tokens — will be available for purchase.  What’s Next for Treasury Bills: New NFT Art  Building on the excitement, there’s much more to come for the project. In the next phase, the NFTs will feature new art, with each unique piece created procedurally at mint.  The ApeSwap team is working with the very talented, a Uruguayan artist who primarily designs tattoos. Her experience in ink offers a very creative eye to illustrate one-of-a-kind, unique NFTs that pay homage to designs from traditional paper notes. Although it is her first NFT project, ApeSwap is confident it won’t be the last.  At minting, each Treasury Bill NFT will feature six variables with 10 options each, creating over 100,000 original combinations which honor the trailblazers of cryptocurrency. Although the history of crypto is relatively short, the activity to further the industry by these trailblazers is immense. ApeSwap is excited to acknowledge and celebrate the collective past of cryptocurrency, with a vision towards the future.  The six variables found on every Treasury Bill NFT are:  * The Certification: The frame color around the legend reflects the purchase amount, ranging from bronze to diamond for the highest-value NFTs.  * The Legend: The trailblazers of cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, and Lighting Labs CEO and founder Elizabeth Stark.  * The Location: Digital and physical spaces which created early use cases for cryptocurrency, such as The Silk Road, The Sandbox, and Switzerland’s Crypto Valley.  * The Moment: Key developments which helped to shape where the cryptocurrency atmosphere is today, including the Bitcoin hard fork, the moment when Tesla began accepting Bitcoin for purchases, and Bitcoin becoming legal tender in El Salvador.  * The Trend: Trends which developed further utility and use cases for cryptocurrency, including the HODL phenomenon, GameFi, and (naturally) NFTs.  * The Innovation: Innovations like the mining rig, stablecoins, smart contracts, and hardware wallets which helped drive cryptocurrency forward into everyday adoption.    The full range of the Treasury Bills NFT collection will launch on April 29, 2022. For those who want the special edition Obie Dobo NFT, it will be available for an additional seven days.  The Future of Treasury Bills  The launch of Treasury Bills was a successful case study by ApeSwap in creating a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT) through an NFT, and the ApeSwap community has played a key role in this success. The sale of Treasury Bill NFTs shows a demand for a liquid token, where the utility is purchasing BA at a discount (as needed based on the SAFT), which can be sold or traded at the discretion of the NFT holder.  Treasury Bills are also one of the first recorded cases of fundraising for community-focused projects after an initial Token Generation Event (TGE). By generating growth without mining more coins, ApeSwap can actively work towards BA remaining a deflationary token, while returning rewards to NFT holders.  Finally, the Treasury Bill product is a complimentary solution to ApeSwap’s liquidity mining products. While liquidity mining is a short-term liquidity source, the Treasury Bills represent a more robust and sustainable liquidity source for products. The ApeSwap DeFi Hub approach to multi-faceted product offerings fulfills the needs of users interested in both short-term opportunities (like Yield Farming) and long-term opportunities (like the purchase of Treasury Bills).  The future of DeFi is a collective effort: it’s up to the greater community to bring ideas to life, and ultimately approve their proposed value proposition. The ApeSwap team couldn’t be more excited to build a new world of products in the crypto space, charting the future of DeFi with the incredible band of Apes."

The IPCC also included the energy requirements for artificial intelligence (A.I.) alongside cryptocurrency and blockchain. However, the body mentioned that all technologies have the potential to enable emissions reductions and increase emissions depending on how they are governed. Large improvements in information storage, processing and communication technologies, including artificial intelligence, will affect emissions. They can enhance energy-efficient control, reduce transaction cost for energy production and distribution, improve demand-side management [...] and reduce the need for physical transport, The IPCC stated.  Cryptocurrencies in the Crosshairs  The IPCC is not the only authorized body to have singled out cryptocurrency as a concern for carbon emissions.  Early this year, U.S. lawmakers began probing Bitcoin mining firms to disclose how much electricity they use for crypto mining, as the impact of cryptocurrency mining on energy is being felt across the world.  In January, eight U.S. senators, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), sent letters to six Bitcoin mining firms in the U.S., asking them to disclose how much electricity they use, where it comes from, and how they plan to grow.  The letters were sent amid an oversight hearing on crypto mining's effect on energy by the House Energy Commerce Committee.  In November last year, Erik Thed en, the Vice-chairman of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), called for a bloc-wide ban on proof of work (PoW) crypto mining in Europe, stating that the industry's energy usage was becoming a national issue in his native Sweden. Bitcoin is now a national issue for Sweden because of the amount of renewable energy devoted to mining, Thed en said.  The E.U. regulator pointed out that crypto mining threatened targets to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius under the 2015 Paris Agreement.  Last year, data from the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index from Digiconomist and the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index showed that the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, consume around twice as much electricity in one year as the whole of Sweden."

In its recent announcement, the platform - Diamond - will use smart contracts and blockchain technology. It will be designed to perform a one-stop shop for data trading and custody with instant settlements, Glenda So, co-head of markets at HKEX, said.  The platform is expected to launch this year, according to CEO of HKEXNicolas Aguzin, We're very excited about the opportunities in digital and the whole transformation that we're observing around the world, said Nicolas Aguzin.  Trading in Diamond will initially consist of ESG (environmental, social and governance-related) products, including carbon-emission related contracts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The platform will also look at digital assets and megatrends.  However, the HKEX - operator of Asia's third-largest stock market - has not planned to make the trading of cryptocurrencies part of the initial stage of Diamond.  According to So's estimation, there could be $60 trillion to $100 trillion by 2030 in the annual trading volume of digital assets.  Digital assets today represent a total market capitalisation of about US$3 trillion. And we've talked about the potential of the market in terms of trading in the future, it could be up to US$100 trillion (in annual volumes) for the whole market in the next 10 years, Aguzin said.  In other crypto-related developments in Hong Kong, Blockchain.News reported earlier this month that the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) published a discussion paper soliciting public contributions to its proposed regulatory approach to digital currencies and stablecoins in particular. The financial regulator also offered 5 ways to the public for further development.  According to the published paper, the HKMA has acknowledged the steady growth in the market capitalization of stablecoins. They are pegged at close to $150 billion, up significantly from less than $20 billion back in January 2020."
"280",528,2022-03-30,"Blockchain.News","Bitcoin's impact on the environment is about to face the limelight as several climate activist organizations such as Greenpeace and crypto billionaire Chris Larsen are launching a campaign to tackle its power usage system, Bloomberg reported.  The campaign titled Change the Code, Not the Climate is trying to push the Bitcoin society to change the way it orders transactions. According to Bloomberg, Bitcoin  consume as much power as Sweden.  Larsen said in an interview that Bitcoin might consume as much power as Japan in five years' time.  Over the next months, the campaign will purchase advertisements in leading publications. Bloomberg said that Greenpeace, Environmental Working Group and some local activist groups have begun working on grassroots efforts to battle Bitcoin miners.  According to the person in charge of the campaign - Michael Brune, the team has already reached several key people and corporations. Some of them have pledged Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) compliance, even though they are involved in Bitcoin.  We are in this campaign for the long haul, but we are hoping - particularly since Bitcoin is now being financed by entities and individuals who care about climate change - that we can compel leadership to agree that this is a problem that needs to be addressed, said Brune. Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, PayPal, Venmo, Fidelity - there are lots of companies we anticipate will be helpful to this effort.  The campaign also said that a supporting cause is increasing frustration in some communities in the U.S. that have found themselves hosting Bitcoin miners and dealing with issues such as excessive noise.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin's rival, Ethereum, is working on a software overhaul to become more environmentally friendly. Currently, it is using giant server farms to order transactions via a process called Proof of Work (PoW), similar to Bitcoin. However, Ethereum's software overhaul could see a switch to Proof of Stake (PoS), which is projected by some to cut its energy consumption by 99%, Bloomberg reported.  Now, with Ethereum changing, Bitcoin really is the outlier, Larsen said. Some of the newer protocols - Solana, Cardano - are built on low energy.  Larsen claims to have put in $5 million to fund the campaign as he feels that Bitcoin will not continue to enjoy investors' support unless it changes. I want to see Bitcoin and Ethereum succeed, said Larsen, who owns some Bitcoin and Ether and XRP.  Bitcoin's impact on the environment was highlighted last year after Elon Musk announced that Tesla Inc. would resume taking Bitcoin only after at least 50% of the mining relies on renewable energy.  According to Larson, Bitcoin's energy consumption problem could be solved through a soft or a hard fork - both changing the network's code to make Bitcoin less power-hungry.  A soft fork would preserve Bitcoin as a single blockchain. A hard fork would split Bitcoin into two separate networks, one supporting miners and the other running different code - perhaps PoS.  Bloomberg reported that the campaign believes that about 50 key miners, crypto exchanges and core developers have the power to change Bitcoin's code."
"281",327,2022-03-29,"Blockchain.News","Rather than wasting natural gas through flaring, oil and energy giant ExxonMobil has launched a pilot program to convert this excess natural gas into energy that powers mobile generators that can mine Bitcoin (BTC).  As  by Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, the pilot program was floated back in January 2021 and was expanded in July of the same year.  ExxonMobil has partnered with Crusoe Energy Systems Inc to take the excess energy from an oil field in Bakken to power the Bitcoin mining farms on site. Per the report, a total of 18 million cubic feet of gas per month, massive energy that would have been burnt as the region does not have enough pipelines to channel the excess gas for commercial or domestic uses.  The role of Bitcoin mining in the environmental sustainability agenda of the world is quite a contentious subject nowadays. While mining activities, in general, have received a lot of criticism and  from regulators across the board for contributing to climate change, the use of this same Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining systems to save natural gas that could have been flared as is being championed by ExxonMobil lends another positive narrative to the story.  With many Bitcoin advocates proposing the use of related excess energy for Bitcoin mining, the perception around the entire PoW activities can be changed from bad to good. In the case of ExxonMobil, the company has planned to take this pilot program to other locations worldwide, including the Qua Iboe terminal in Nigeria, Guyana, Alaska, and Germany.  Bitcoin mining can be relatively productive depending on the approaches adopted. While many miners are moving towards a more renewable energy source to power their mining operations, the conversion of  for BTC mining by oil giants will do more good for our climate than the energy consumed by BTC do prominently posited."

"288",467,2022-03-16,"Blockchain.News","The European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee voted Monday, a move that quashed a ban on popular cryptocurrency Bitcoin across the European Union (EU). The committee voted against the ban on Proof-of-Work mechanisms underlying major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The committee decided to keep out the rule of the proposed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework, the EU's comprehensive regulatory package for governing digital assets.  The rule, which was introduced to the draft last week, aimed to limit the use of cryptocurrencies powered by an energy-intensive computing process known as proof-of-work across the EU's 27 member states. The proposal was eventually repealed as a result of widespread opposition from the sector.  Dr Stefan Berger, EU parliamentarian in charge of the MiCA legislative framework, talked about the announcement on Twitter social media platform: ""First stage win at #MiCA in committee! By accepting my proposal, members have paved the way for future-oriented crypto regulation. It is now a matter of accepting the report as a whole in the final vote sending out a strong signal for innovation.""  However, Dr. Berger stated that the controversial paragraph has been withdrawn, and a final decision is yet to be made.  Switching to Proof of Stake  The use of Proof-of-Work (PoW) cryptocurrencies was uncertain following the draft of the European Union's (EU) proposed legal framework for managing virtual currencies, known as the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) framework.  The clause, which could have forced PoW cryptocurrencies to shift to more environmentally friendly mechanisms, failed to get the votes required in the parliament.  Major crypto assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on PoW, a consensus mechanism underlying the digital assets that require a lot of energy to operate.  In recent months, the computing process has come under intense examination from legislators because of worries about the usage of energy. While the popularity of Bitcoin has grown, the controversy over its energy consumption and environmental impact has intensified.  As a result, some of the major cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Dogecoin have shown intentions to migrate from the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) crypto consensus mechanism. PoS refers to processing transactions and creating new blocks in a blockchain in an environment and efficient friendly manner.  However, there is still no consensus in the crypto community about the PoS model being better than PoW. Some users and well-known names in the market, like Jack Dorsey, have highlighted that the new method does not provide as much security to the network as proof of work offers. Meanwhile, there is no sign that Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, will migrate to the PoS system."
"289",2176,2022-03-15,"Brave New Coin","With Ethereum’s ultimate move to Proof-of-Stake rapidly approaching, ThumbsUpFinance offers some new perspectives on the POW vs POS debate.  When I first got interested in cryptocurrency, I was immediately enamoured with the technology and had to dig deeper and learn all I could. I learned about how transactions are written to a global, decentralized ledger, and those transactions are immutable — meaning they can’t be stopped or reversed — which makes them censorship-resistant and very secure.  As a technophile, born into the dial-up days of the internet, I’ve always been one to become obsessed with the way things work. The how, the why, and the way systems can evolve excites me. Little did I know, the world of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and Web3 would provide more information than I knew what do with.  One of the first things I learned is that Bitcoin maintains its decentralization through a process called Proof-of-Work mining. You’ve probably heard that this is not great for the environment, that it’s slow and wasteful; or perhaps you’ve heard that it’s decentralized, egalitarian, and secure. In a way, both are true, and in a way, neither are.  In this article, I want to take a look at what Proof-of-Work is and compare it to another method of securing and decentralizing blockchains, which you may have heard of, called Proof-of-Stake.  So let’s get into it  Proof-of-What?  I’ll start by laying down a little foundation for this discussion, since, for some readers, this may be your introduction to what is a rather complex subject. As I mentioned in, Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) are commonly referred to as consensus mechanisms, however, this is actually a misnomer. These are Sybil resistance mechanisms and are only one-half of the full consensus mechanism employed by a given blockchain.  According to Ethereum.org, Sybil resistance ""measures how a protocol fares against a. Sybil attacks are when one user or group pretends to be many users. Resistance to this type of attack is essential for a decentralized blockchain and enables miners and validators to be rewarded equally based on resources put in. Proof-of-work and proof-of-stake protect against this by making users expend a lot of energy or put up a lot of collateral. These protections are an economic deterrent to Sybil attacks.""  With Sybil resistance being at the core of securing a blockchain, it’s no wonder that tensions run high over which mechanism is chosen. Interestingly though, many people don’t fully understand how these work, how they differ, and how similar they are to one another.  Below I’ll briefly explain how Proof-of-Work… works, how Proof-of-Stake differs, and finally, I’ll make the case that one has more upside. But which?  PoW: How Does It Work?  At the core of the Bitcoin, Ethereum, Flux (and many other) networks is a mechanism called Nakamoto Consensus. First described in a 2008 whitepaper by a pseudonymous (or group of cypherpunks) called Satoshi Nakamoto, this combination of Proof-of-Work Sybil resistance and the longest chain rule for maintaining a canonical blockchain history was — and is — groundbreaking.  Jargon aside, what this looks like, in the simplest of terms, is the following:  Using specialized hardware like computer graphics cards (GPUs) or application-specific integrated circuits (), networks like Bitcoin require those who validate the transactions to provide proof that they have done a difficult and energy-intensive task. This function is called ‘mining’ and miners are engaged in a race to find an extremely random number called a nonce.  The nonce is the missing piece of a cryptographic puzzle that is holding up the current block from being finalized so that the next block can become available. Given the pace at which transactions are intended to occur, the first miner to solve the puzzle receives a block reward: a predetermined payout from programmatic inflation doled out in the respective block.  Those with more computing power (referred to as hashrate) will be more likely to win block rewards. In order to attain that computing power, miners–and more often mining companies or pools–will need to purchase more hardware and expend more energy.  This is where the energy debate usually begins.  Environmentally minded folks worry that Proof-of-Work’s energy usage begets a huge carbon footprint. After all, much of the world is still getting its power from fossil fuels.    <center>Source: </center>  Interestingly, does not seem to support this argument, as many mining operations set up shop where energy is cheapest: near hydro-electric dams, solar and wind farms, and other renewables. This also demonstrates that Proof-of-Work is agnostic to the kind of energy used. And, interestingly, the idea that Proof-of-Work can serve as a means of monetizing energy itself creates some unique opportunities. For example, solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal operations typically produce more energy than they can use or store, creating what is known as stranded energy.  This energy could be stored (as battery technology improves), but even then, there may be more value in diverting some or all of this excess to mining. The reason? Building renewable energy infrastructure usually requires subsidies from governments, which slows the rate at which it’s rolled out. Whereas operations that can monetize stranded energy could hypothetically fund themselves, perhaps eliminating the need for subsidy altogether.  This is just one of many interesting ideas, all of which are worth studying further. Here’s that’s worth checking out on this subject. Now to Proof-of-Stake  What’s At Stake with PoS?  As we’ve seen above, Proof-of-Work is, at its core, about trading capital (investments in equipment and property; ongoing energy costs) for the opportunity to validate blocks and thus earn rewards. This is done in a roundabout way that creates numerous externalities, some positive, as discussed above, and some negative, which we’ll come back to later.  Proof-of-Stake is built around that assessment. Its proponents assert that if all that’s truly happening in a PoW system is that someone is putting their capital at stake by investing in equipment, property, and energy, then why not just stake the capital itself?  Since it was first implemented by Peercoin in 2012, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) has grown to become the most prominently used method of Sybil resistance for cryptocurrencies and other blockchain-based projects. Outside of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin, nearly all of the most well-known blockchains (Polygon, Avalanche, Tezos, Cardano, Solana) use Proof-of-Stake. Furthermore, Ethereum itself is fast approaching a long-awaited conversion from PoW to PoS.  In essence, running an Ethereum Proof-of-Stake validator requires either some basic computer hardware ( a Raspberry Pi is sufficient) and either 32 $ETH (around $80,000 at today’s prices), staked in a smart contract; or any amount of $ETH deposited into a staking pool—I’ll come back to that in a future post.  Proof-of-Stake validators are incentivized to participate honestly to earn rewards. They are disincentivized from attacking the system, in most cases, through a penalty called. This is an automated process built into the staking protocol that burns a portion of the staked capital of those who violate any of a small set of clearly defined rules.  In the case of Ethereum’s system, malicious actors will only have three chances before they’ve had their entire stake slashed. This method of fraud/censorship prevention reduces the need to fork the chain in the event of an attack. However, that remains a completely viable option in the event of a sustained.  Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake - who wins?  While the simplest appeal, to the arguably needless waste of energy by Proof-of-Work, is often the one made as justification for why Proof-of-Stake is better, that’s not the narrative I intend to follow.  Proof-of-Work can work and could be ideal for some blockchains. Needless to say, it provides a way to monetize stranded energy, subsidize green energy, and at the same time decentralize blockchain computation. However, there are several areas where I believe PoS outperforms PoW, which we’ll go over below.  Note: While I’ve formulated my opinion through countless hours of absorbing information from whitepapers, interviews, and reflection on the subject, much of what I’ve come to believe overlaps with the points made by Charles Hoskinson in from an interview with Lex Fridman. As such, I recommend watching it as a supplement to this article.  Egalitarian Participation  While some may argue that the barrier to becoming an Ethereum validator ($80,000 at today’s cost) is higher than to becoming a Bitcoin miner (entry-level ASICs can be purchased for around $5000), this is a bit misleading. As I mentioned above, those winning the majority of the block rewards are those with the most hashpower, and since increasing hashpower benefits from economies of scale, larger operations disproportionately benefit. This creates a feedback loop that adds to centralization.  Similarly, those with access to cheap energy, like governments for instance, can easily create major mining operations. On a small scale, this seems like a good thing. El Salvador, for example, is using its Bitcoin profits (mined renewably from) to provide public goods to its citizens. But imagine, for example, several countries with large amounts of energy at their disposal, like Russia, China, Saudi Arabia joining forces to exercise 51% attacks on the system and censor transactions from their adversaries.  This brings me to my next point…  Security  Not all Proof-of-Work is run by ASICs in densely packed warehouses. It is entirely possible for numerous small participants to contribute to the security of the network. In a hypothetical scenario where every citizen of the world had one or more miners, the level of decentralization would create tremendous security. However, in the current system, and in some ways even in that hypothetical system, large mining operations would still be easy targets.  For example, if tomorrow, a non-economic actor (someone who cares more about destroying a blockchain network than the economic costs they will incur; like a government), decided to attempt to attack the Bitcoin network, finding large scale operations and thus the majority of hashpower is very easy due to the footprint left by their energy consumption.  In a Proof-of-Stake system, validators are effectively invisible. They have blockchain addresses that can be traced, but their energy footprint is no more than that of an ordinary computer. It can quickly and easily be relocated across town, across the country, across borders.  Which brings me to my next point…  Hardware  While everyone focuses on the energy use of running blockchains, they miss a far more important point: the hardware used has a shelf life. Over time it gets worn down and becomes less profitable. In some cases, it's refurbished and resold to amateur miners, which is a wonderful way to extend its life. But nonetheless, the final resting place for all of this equipment is the landfill. Bitcoin at present serves only a tiny portion of population, but requires tremendous amounts of specialized hardware, running at high temperatures 24 hours per day. As it scales, the potential for this eWaste to get out of hand is inarguable.  Mining hardware also has a centralization problem. Popular ASICs are made by only a small handful of companies that could themselves act maliciously, or more likely become targets for state interference. Graphics cards companies, like NVIDIA have already shown a predisposition for bricking their own cards. And of course, they do this for a reason. Demand for graphics cards to build mining rigs has altered the markets and made buying a card for gaming or professional applications overwhelmingly costly.  This brings me to my final thought on the externalities of using hashpower for mining…  Why?  If you agree with the premise that both Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are equally dependant on capital, and thus the hardware expended arguably does not add sufficient value to the process, then wouldn’t it be more ethical to pool that hashpower to do other valuable things like open-source medical research, or modelling climate change solutions, or at the very least using all those graphics cards to democratize access to 3D rendering, like what is aiming to do?  In my humble opinion, it would. But that’s just me.  Hopefully, I’ve provided a little food for thought. I see potential use cases for both mechanisms. Do you?

"290",324,2022-03-15,"Blockchain.News","The European Union could see a major change in the cryptocurrency industry as proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrencies face an indeterminate future.  Proof-of-work cryptocurrencies are designed in an energy-intensive consensus mechanism.  PoW cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have been added to a proposed legislative framework for governing virtual currencies, which is set to be voted by a European Parliament on March 14 local time and could limit the use of such currencies.  The current draft version of the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework has  switching from PoW cryptocurrencies to the more environmentally friendly proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism.  It says that crypto assets ""shall be subject to minimum environmental sustainability standards with respect to their consensus mechanism used for validating transactions, before being issued, offered or admitted to trading in the Union.""  The previous version of the MiCA framework saw heavy industry backlash as it contained language that appeared primed to prohit proof-of-work cryptocurrencies. The framework proposed a prohibition of crypto services that rely on environmentally unsustainable consensus mechanisms from 2025.  However, Dr Stefan Berger, EU parliamentarian in charge of the MiCA legislative framework, had noted that a final decision is yet to be made.  The provision also added that if a PoW consensus mechanism is operating on a small scale, it is exempt from having to meet sustainability standards.  According to the provision, if a PoW consensus mechanism is operating on a small scale, it is exempt from meeting sustainability standards. What qualifies as a small-scale operation has yet to be determined.  The EU has cited environmental concerns as to its main reason for cracking down on cryptocurrency in the radical proposal.  Even though Ethereum is under process to move from aPoW to a less energy-consuming PoS consensus, Bitcoin - the largest global cryptocurrency by volume traded - is unclear how it will transition from PoW."
"291",1079,2022-03-14,"Brave New Coin","In this article, we will talk about what Ethereum is, how 2021 was for Ethereum and whether 2022 will be a make-or-break year for Ethereum.  What is Ethereum?  Launched in 2015 by computer programmer Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH), the native cryptocurrency of the platform, is the second-largest as well as the world in terms of market capitalization, outranked only by Bitcoin.  Ether and Bitcoin both can be used as digital currency and stores of value. But what makes Ethereum more special is that it allows developers to build and run decentralized applications and smart contracts. Being a blockchain-based software network, it therefore has compelling use cases in a range of industries; gaming, music, entertainment, and decentralized finance (DeFi) to name a few.  Before diving into what 2022 will look like for Ethereum and whether or not it will prove to be a good investment, let us first have a quick recap of how 2021 was for Ethereum.  Ethereum's 2021 Recap  2021 was the busiest year for Ethereum so far. In November 2021, the price of Ether jumped to an all-time high of over US$4,800. The  rate was around ₨ 345,480 at that time.  Since Ethereum's use cases are endless and are not limited to only being a store of value, it has witnessed a massive rise in its market capitalization.  In April 2021, the global market capitalization of Ethereum reached new heights - hitting 300 billion U.S. dollars. By August it was over 400 billion and had hit 500 billion by November. However, it closed the year at around 400 billion U.S dollars. Then, in January 2022, the Ethereum market capitalization again saw a dump and fell down to around 300 billion U.S dollars.  However, all that glitters is not gold. Ethereum has also received a major backlash from users and investors for several reasons. It seemed as if Ethereum had been a victim of its own success.  Let's delve into why Ethereum received criticism from all around the world and how 2022 will bring a change to that scenario.  Ethereum 2.0: What 2022 holds in store for Ethereum?  From $0.311 in 2015 to an all-time-high of around $4,800 in 2021, the journey of Ethereum has been a roller coaster ride. However, it has had a difficult start to 2022 when the Ethereum price slide down to $2,200 in January.  Despite a rough entry into the year, most experts are bullish on Ethereum, expecting ETH to cross the US$10,000-mark by the end of the year, which is equivalent to approximately 76,000 INR at current rates.  Even at the time of writing, the is Rs. 2,04,514 and has fallen down by 4.3% since yesterday. However, Ethereum (ETH) is on an upward monthly trajectory as it has increased around 20% from Rs. 1,79,718 in mid-January.  Much of the optimism surrounding the Ethereum network currently are related to a range of important updates Ethereum will release during the year - commonly referred to as Ethereum 2.0.  Let’s take a look at what changes will be introduced in the Ethereum network.  The most crucial change is the transition of Ethereum's consensus verification mechanism from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake. Bitcoin and Ethereum currently use the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. Unfortunately, since PoW networks require the use of energy-intensive mining processes to establish consensus, they have been singled out for criticism for their environmental impact.  For instance, the Ethereum network annually uses around 99 Terawatt-hours of electricity. To give you a perspective, this is more power than is required by the Philippines or Belgium. Therefore, the transition to Ethereum 2.0 is a significant event for users and investors concerned about environmental issues.  In addition to this, what made many Ethereum users unhappy in 2021 was its high transaction/gas fees and low transaction speed. This is an ongoing issue for Ethereum and is creating an open door for prospective Ethereum killers to onboard new users at a faster pace - which has seen many of them achieve major growth.  To address its energy usage and transaction speed issues, Ethereum began transitioning to the beacon chain proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism around the end of 2020. The end of the transition, sometimes referred to as ‘The Merge’ is expected occur close to the end of 2022.  Ultimately this transition will result in a reduction in transaction fees and energy consumption - bringing Ethereum into a more sustainable position longer-term - both from an environmental and economic perspective. Finally, some happy news for Ethereum lovers in 2022!  Moreover, for users who are worried if Ethereum’s transition will impact their work, a team member from the Ethereum network confirmed that the transition is designed to have minimal impact on how Ethereum operates for end-users, smart contracts, and dapps.  Future of Ethereum in 2022 and beyond  With the booming growth of decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, blockchain technology, Metaverse, and Web3, cryptocurrency has become a topic of household discussion in India.  With almost every company jumping on the crypto bandwagon and announcing its entry into the Metaverse, it seems 2022 will bring good times for blockchain networks. Ethereum already has several NFT and metaverse projects running.  With the increase in the adoption of Blockchain technology paired with continuous improvement in the Ethereum Network such as lower transaction fees and seamless working, the growth of the Ethereum Network may further surge in the future.  Assuming Ethereum 2.0 is successful, experts believe Ethereum's chart will witness an elevation in the long run. On the other hand, when it comes to short-term sentiments, they are pretty bearish. It won't come out as a shock if the chart keeps declining.  Ethereum has maintained its position as one of the leading smart contract platforms. What is yet to be seen is whether Ethereum 2.0 will continue to be one of the clear leaders in 2022 and beyond as well.  Editorial Note: This is a sponsored article.

"293",415,2022-02-23,"Blockchain.News","Russia's finance ministry has said that it is willing to take suggestions on cryptocurrencies from the country's central bank, but they should not clash with their approach.  This approach has paved the way for legislating governance of digital assets.  Last Friday, the finance ministry submitted legislative proposals to the government, which heated a debate over cryptocurrency regulation in Russia as it clashed with the central bank's demand for a total crypto ban.  The Bank of Russia has argued that cryptocurrency trading and mining should be banned as they threaten financial stability. On the other side of the argument, the finance ministry suggests that regulating cryptocurrencies will allow them as an investment tool but not as a legal tender.  The finance ministry's draft legislation aims to create a legal market for digital currencies, it said on Monday.  One proposal is for  involving the purchase or sale of cryptocurrency requiring customer identification, a move that may diminish one of the cryptocurrencies' major selling points - their anonymity.  Other proposals from the finance ministry include issuing licences for foreign cryptocurrency exchanges in Russia and financial literacy tests that determine how much individuals are permitted to invest.  According to the finance ministry, citizens who successfully pass the tests would be permitted to invest up to 600,000 roubles ($7,853) in digital currencies each year. Those who fail would have an investment limit set at 50,000 roubles annually.  The central bank also stated that cryptocurrency mining absorbs a lot of energy and has warned of inefficient energy consumption and the environmental impact of the mining. At the same time, the finance ministry prefers to permit mining on a taxation basis.  According to a recent report by Moscow-based news outlet The Bell, data collected from Russian authorities showed that the country could earn 1 trillion rubles ($13 billion) each year by taxing cryptocurrency transactions.  The global crypto market capitalization was $1.87 trillion in 2021, with a 12% share coming from Russians. The report further added that Russians form 10% of the crypto users or 12 million people who use foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, the report added.  Previously, Bloomberg reported that Kremlin estimated the Russian cryptocurrency market values more than 16.5 trillion rubles ($214 billion), which is around 12% of the total value of global crypto market capitalization - a number significantly higher than the $5 billion put forward by the central bank."

As a result, ETH's median fees dropped to lows not seen since July 2021. Market insight provider Santiment  :  With Ethereum dropping back below $3,000, the demand to make $ETH transactions has stayed relatively low. And with this, transaction fees are now officially at their lowest level since July 28, 2021. Low fees typically maximize the chances of a bounce.  Source:Santiment  Furthermore, the average gas fee on the Ethereum network slipped to $15.13 or 0.0052 ETH per transfer, a scenario not seen since September 2021, according to crypto insight provider Bitinfocharts.  Source:Bitinfocharts  A drop in gas fees is bullish because it can attract more participants to the ETH ecosystem, thus reigniting demand, and this boils down to a price increase based on market forces.  The fee issue is fundamental in aiding the sustainability of the Ethereum network, given that users have developed a keen eye as to where to get value for money in the crypto space.  For instance, Ethereum killers like Solana have gained steam because of their relatively lower fees and faster transaction rates.  With the merge to a consensus layer, formerly Ethereum 2.0,  for the second quarter of this year, it remains to be seen whether the high gas fee challenge in the ETH ecosystem will be amicably addressed.  The consensus layer seeks to transition the present proof of work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof of stake (PoS) framework, deemed more cost-effective and environmentally friendly."

Can this growth be sustained?   is a Hong-Kong based one-stop-shop cryptocurrency exchange that offers derivatives, fiat-to-crypto, crypto-to-crypto, and OTC solutions for investors and traders. The exchange is powered by a native token, FTT. Using FTT on FTX gives traders discounts on trading fees and a variety of other perks. Staking FTT gives users further powerups on the exchange including access to airdrops and further fee discounts. FTX works as both a utility token and as a proxy bet on the growth of the FTX ecosystem.  Despite only being founded in 2019, FTX has risen to a position of prominence within the crypto exchange space. It is currently the second largest fiat-to-crypto exchange in the world, behind Coinbase, controlling ~18% of the fiat-to-crypto trading volume. It also hosts the second largest share of Bitcoin futures open interest in the world.

While some competitors struggled to handle and capture the influx of new crypto buyers in 2021, FTX’s volume surged and it appeared to competently onboard many new users.  In the last week, the exchange has grabbed headlines following a  that gave FTX an enormous US$32 billion valuation. FTX is not just large for a crypto company, its new valuation makes it the 8th largest start-up, of any kind, in the world according to .  It is bigger than powerhouse tech brands like Epic Games, Nubank and Grammarly. Participants in the funding round included Paradigm, Temasek, Multicoin Capital, and SoftBank. All participants had participated in previous FTX investment rounds. This Series C funding comes a few months after the firm raised $420 million, which at the time gave it a US$25 billion valuation.  Matt Huang, co-founder of VC firm Paradigm, , “Their volume and market share growth over the past two years tells a clear story … just the beginning of what's to come!” Huang also described FTX as, “a generational company in the making.”  The FTT token is currently the 29th largest on the Brave New Coin market cap table. At the beginning of 2021, it was the 41st largest asset in crypto. At the time the market cap of FTT was US$653.3 million, the value of the token is now US$4.9 billion.  In the last year, the price of the FTT token has risen from US$11.86 to currently sit at US$45.14. This constitutes a ~281% rise in value.  Exchange Token Performance in the Last Year    Source: The Block Data, CryptoCompare  While perhaps not as exciting as the gains of other exchange tokens like Binance's BNB and Crypto.com's CRO, the gains of FTT appear to be more consistent and cycle resistant than others as it has shown an ability to hold relative value and resilience during bearish periods.  An indication of this resilience is its price performance over the last month. In the last 30 days while Bitcoin (BTC) and fellow exchange token Binance-coin (BNB) have dipped by ~21%, and ~28%, in the face of bearish global macro tailwinds, FTT has risen by ~3%.  Origins of FTX  FTX launched in April 2019 and was incubated by , a quant-focused cryptocurrency trading firm. FTX was incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda but is headquartered in Hong Kong. FTX and Alameda share the same leader, the mercurial .  Forbes lists Sam Bankman-Fried . Bankman-Fried is just 29 years old. He studied physics at MIT and is the son of two Stanford law professors. After starting off in crypto in 2017, initially gaining success finding arbitrage opportunities in Asian markets, Bankman-Fried built FTX as an exchange “by traders for traders.” He has helped steward it to become one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world.  On top of the success of FTX, it has often been stated by insiders that Alameda Research may be the single largest investor in the crypto space. At one point it was believed that Alameda constituted for 5% of the total crypto trading volume, handling around US$1 billion of trading volume a day.  During the early days Alameda helped FTX bootstrap its growth by being its primary market maker, however, this function has become less required over time as FTX became larger. Alameda still has a core role in powering FTX’s no-fee OTC desk.  Beyond Alameda, the FTX ecosystem is littered with other interconnected entities that support each other. While “FTX” is the main holding company based in Hong Kong, it has two branches FTX.com and FTX.us.  FTX.com is what most people visualize when they think of FTX. It is a full-featured exchange with numerous bells and whistles. It hosts different innovative products and a variety of fiat on-ramp options, and derivatives. FTX.us is a watered-down version of FTX.com and features fewer exotic products so that it can be within the bounds of stricter crypto regulations in the United States. This is similar to the relationship between Binance and Binance U.S.  In August 2020, FTX acquired the market-leading mobile news and portfolio tracking app, Blockfolio, for $150 million. Blockfolio offered FTX significant access into the retail crypto traders space and the app has since been integrated into FTX branding. Blockfolio’s technology now acts as the backbone of the FTX mobile app.  The final piece of the FTX ecosystem is Serum, a decentralized exchange built on Solana. Serum was built by Alameda and Bankman-Fried. Alameda offers liquidity on Serum and FTX routes some of its trading flow to Serum.    Source:   The FTX model for derivatives liquidation helps it grow  FTX was initially launched with a focus on creating a better environment for crypto derivatives traders. The exchange uses a unique 3-tiered liquidation model designed to minimize the social losses associated with leveraged positions being liquidated on crypto exchanges.  With leveraged trading, traders are using borrowed money - this means their accounts can go negative during sharp price moves against them. In crypto derivatives trading, unlike in traditional finance, because of reduced KYC and AML requirements, and the non-use of brokers, an exchange cannot go outside of the system to claim assets to cover a trader's losses.  Because of this other traders on exchanges have to help cover positions when leverage traders face negative account balances and a social cost is incurred.  In a worst case scenario an exchange will institute a clawback to prevent the losses from a large leveraged account crashing it. A   FTX attempts to prevent the social loss of trading by taking an early, staggered approach to dealing with leveraged accounts that are about to go negative.  Like other crypto derivatives exchanges, FTX starts the process by automatically detecting when a user has dropped below a maintenance margin. This is when it is dropping quickly but still not yet negative. The initial maintenance margin for FTX is much higher than other crypto derivative exchanges and at this first stage, traders are prevented from making new trades.  At the second stage, if the account drops further, FTX will begin market selling from the users account to maintain the position.  “We don’t sell so quickly that the liquidation orders themselves will crash the market; that would be dooming the entire process. We also don’t give up if the price looks ‘bad’ — it might only get worse from there and you have to do the best you can liquidating an account rather than hoping things magically reverse.” FTX explains in a .  FTX writes that this is usually enough, however, if the price falls further then a backstop liquidity provider system kicks in. In this situation, liquidity providers who have opted into the system will internalize the position. They’ll step in close to when a position goes bankrupt, to manage the collateral and obligation. The backstop liquidity providers will source liquidity from other exchanges and inject it into FTX as an extra layer of protection.  FTX explains that if all else fails there is a final step, “FTX will do what other exchanges do — it will auto-delever an account’s position against accounts that have the opposite position on, and attempt to cover any losses out of the insurance fund; and if the insurance fund runs dry then there will be clawbacks.”  Clawbacks are rare but have occurred in the crypto derivatives space in the past. FTX’s more measured approach has stood them in good stead within the crypto trading community.  Nobody wants to pay for other traders' mistakes and FTX more so than any other crypto derivatives platform ensures that this does not happen. The platform’s growth in the last two years is an indication that traders approve of the strategy.    The majority of FTX’s revenue is generated from its Futures product. Source: The Generalist  Other things FTX does well  Beyond an innovative approach to managing margin trading liquidations, there are other things that FTX does well.  FTX popularized the Leverage Tokens model. Leveraged Tokens mimic the experience of trading on spot markets but allow 3X, -1X, or -3X multipliers on various tokens. I.e. With the Bitcoin3X if the spot price of BTC rises by 1%, Bitcoin3X will rise by 3 times that. With Bitcoin-3x if the spot price of BTC rises by 1% the Bitcoin-3X will fall by 3 times that.  Traders can add multipliers to go long or short on a crypto asset without having to deal with using margin. Users can less messily attempt to gain leveraged returns. These simple derivative products were instantly popular on the platform.  FTX was also the first exchange to popularize and create efficient markets for BVOL. The BVOL token tracks the implied volatility of the Bitcoin price. These tokens can be longed and shorted to bet on the predictability or unpredictability of the BTC price.  FTX also offers tokenized versions of stocks like Gamestop and Apple to crypto native traders. This product is offered through a partnership with CM-Equity as a brokerage. CM-Equity is fully regulated in Germany, and is a licensed financial institution permitted to offer these products. Beyond this FTX also offers prediction and options trading, to ensure it covers as many bases as possible.  Amongst FTX’s other unique features is the option for ERC-20 withdrawals for users who stake native FTT. In the last year gas prices have shot up because of the growing popularity of Ethereum. Gas prices are also variable and this means that they can jump to unsustainable levels.  ERC20 tokens are popular on many crypto exchanges for speculative purposes. Moving them between private wallets and exchanges can get as high as US$50 for a single withdrawal on days when the network is busy.  FTT holders, based on the numbers they have staked, get access to a set number of free ERC20 withdrawals a day. Users who stake 25 FTT get access to 1 free ERC20 withdrawal a day. At the highest tier, users who stake 1,000,000 FTT get access to 1000 free ERC20 withdrawals.  FTX is also appreciated by the crypto community for its handling of US dollar stablecoins. FTX treats all stablecoins the same apart from US-Dollar Tether (USDT). This means users don’t have to worry about finding the right stablecoin market for the right trading pair or exchanging between stablecoins in order to find a matching pair.  USD, USDC, TUSD, USDP, BUSD, and HUSD all count as “USD Stablecoin” balances on FTX.  FTX also supports a variety of different fiat currencies.    Source: Medium user @stakingbits  Users can deposit and withdraw fiat currencies via wire transfer. In order to freely transfer fiat funds on FTX users have to go through level 2 KYC/AML verification. This is comprehensive and involves providing: full legal name, date of birth, address, proof-of-address/phone jurisdiction, description of source assets, a passport and other similar government-issued identification, and facial verification.  FTX only charges for withdrawals in USD and BRL, USD withdrawals under US$10,000 incur a US$75 fee.  FTX also has a feature that allows for straightforward and quick conversion from other fiat currencies to USD or USD stablecoins. Fiat currencies are converted into USD stablecoins using the live exchange rate that the FTX OTC desk uses.  Another example of FTX’s product experimentation is its NFT marketplace. FTX allows artists to create and upload their creations and sell them to the exchange’s users.  The marketplace is notable for some FTX-specific NFT experiences. On the marketplace a user can buy an NFT that is redeemable for an in-person lunch or 30-minute Zoom call with Sam Bankman-Fried. Users can also redeem an NFT that is redeemable for a game of League of Legends against an FTX team.  The depositing and minting of NFTs is not available on FTX international. Both US and non-US users can mint, deposit and trade NFTs on FTX.US.    FTX has recently launched a product focused on merchants, FTX Pay. FTX Pay is a widget that a merchant can use to accept both crypto and fiat payments for their site, app, or store.  There are two ways merchants can receive payments through FTX Pay, either an FTX account, and an external wallet. Just like the NFT marketplace, international merchants seeking to access FTX Pay have to reach it through FTX.us at ftx.us/pay. This is despite FTX Pay not being unavailable to merchants in the United States.  What is the FTT token?  FTT is the utility token of FTX and offers holders a variety of benefits on the exchange. These include:  * The weekly burning and buyback of FTT tokens, a proxy dividend for holders  * Lower FTX trading fees  * FTT is used as collateral for futures trading  * Socialized gains from the insurance fund  33% of all fees generated by the exchange, 10% of all net additions to the insurance fund, and 5% of all other fees will be used for the repurchase and subsequent burning of FTT until half the total supply is destroyed.  Assuming that demand to use the FTT token grows over time or remains constant, the burn feature which constricts the supply of the token should have a positive effect on the price of FTT. Given the rapid growth of FTT over the last two years this appears to be a simple investment thesis.  Fee discounts for FTT holders begin from 3% if the user holds US$100 worth of FTX and rise up to as much as 60% for users holding at least US$5 million worth of FTT. As a maker, if you stake FTT, then you don’t pay any fees and also receive small rebates.  FTT holders also get increased referral rebate rates. Referrers that stake FTT are paid a higher fraction of their referees' fees.    Branding: The visibility of FTX builds  FTX has developed an aggressive marketing and branding strategy. In the summer of 2021, it was announced that FTX had bought the naming rights for NBA franchise, the Miami Heat. The exchange bought the rights for a whopping US$135 million and the former American Airlines arena is now the FTX arena.    A few days after this the company spent a further US$210 million to gain the naming rights for e-sports giant Team Solo-Mid. After the deal, Team Solo-Mid became “TSM FTX”.  Just a few weeks after these two deals, FTX became the first crypto company to become a Major League Baseball (MLB) sponsor. Now MLB umpires have an FTX patch on their sleeves.    Source: Google Trends  Data from Google Trends indicates that since the summer of 2021 worldwide search interest for the term ‘FTX’ has steadily ticked upwards.    Source: Google Trends  The related query and topic data indicate that the FTX arena and Team Solo-mid were clear factors in the uptick of search interest.  Similar to , FTX is spending a large amount of money to embed its brand in the culture of the demographics that crossover into crypto.  Crypto, basketball, baseball, and e-sports are all popular with young adult males. Often buying into crypto is a cultural decision that is based on other factors outside of a black or white decision about whether an investment will generate a return. FTX understands that new users often get into crypto because it is perceived to be cool, exciting, and glamorous.  FTX is also considered one of the good guys in the crypto space. The  is a non-profit organization that collects 1% of all fees generated by FTX and then donates them to cost-effective charities. In June 2021, the FTX Foundation launched FTX climate, a project with hopes to make FTX carbon neutral. FTX climate also funds promising climate change research.  In October 2021, the FTX foundation also announced a fellowship program to support high quality community projects and build an effective altruism community in Barbados.  Conclusion  FTX is officially one of the largest startups in the world, crypto or otherwise. Its recent whopping US$32 billion valuation has caught the attention of observers in the tech and crypto space. FTX has become one of the visible brands in the crypto space because of its eye catching investment rounds and marketing plays such as its sponsorship of one of the largest sporting and events venues in Florida.  The FTT token has enjoyed strong gains in the last two years alongside the booming FTX exchange. Its dual value as a utility token to be used on the exchange and as a way for retail users to speculate on the growth of the FTX exchange, has helped it hold value even when wider market conditions are bearish. In the last month, as other digital assets have dipped drastically in value, FTT has held steady.  Looking underneath the hood, it is easy to see why FTX has so many committed investors and users. It is one of the most innovative builders of new trading products in crypto and more importantly, it has focused on building a smooth, fair trading platform for margin and spot crypto traders. Mapping out FTX it is clear that throughout the ecosystem there is a focus on good engineering, quality, culture and ethics.  FTX continues to absorb more volume and market share from competitors within the crypto spot and derivatives ecosystem and it seems likely that this upward momentum will continue."

The Cyberspace Administration's official Wechat social media account said that the pilot zones include areas in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as Guangzhou and Chengdu in the southern Guangdong and Sichuan provinces respectively.  The announcement which came via a joint government statement also added that the entities will conduct the projects in fields such as manufacturing, energy, government and tax services, law, education, health, trade and finance, and cross border finance.  ""Each area's cyberspace administration and relevant industry regulator should... Give full play to the role of blockchain in promoting data sharing, optimising business processes, reducing operating costs and improving collaboration efficiency in building a credible system,"" the statement said.  China pushes towards blockchain technology started in 2019 when President Xi Jinping called for boosting the development of the technology as the core for innovation.  China has also been pushing for the introduction of a digital yuan.  According to  China said that Macau is  to be a testbed for China's digital yuan, also known as the e-CNY, as casino owners prepare to bid for new licenses in the city for the first time in two decades.  Chinese regulators will be looking forward to using the casino licensing opportunity to test the digital yuan in 2022, according to Reuters.  The government authorities have also pitched ideas like appointing agents to supervise daily casino operations, the report added.  Prior to making a move towards enhancing the use of blockchain technology, China issued a complete ban on cryptocurrency transactions and mining - which are based on the technology.  According to a Blockchain.News report, China implemented its zero-tolerance policy for Bitcoin mining in May 2021, with a series of crackdowns on miners that finally led to the exodus of mining firms from the Asian nation. Beijing's negative stance about crypto miners is fueled by the supposed environmental impact as the majority of the nation's power source comes from coal."
"300",1474,2022-01-26,"Blockchain.News","Kazakhstan has been in the crypto news a lot lately. On the surface, we know that it's a Central-Asian nation with cheap electricity that became the world's second-largest center for cryptocurrency mining after China's crackdown on crypto.  Kazakhstan experienced violent clashes between protesters, police, and soldiers, which resulted in an internet blackout that caused difficulties to normal crypto mining operations. The crypto community feared it would have a drastic impact on global crypto markets.  But what's going on behind the scenes? What exactly is the cause of this crisis? What are its likely outcomes? And what are the prospects for crypto in that country? Find out here.  Background of the Country  Kazakhstan is an ex-Soviet country the size of Western Europe with considerable mineral resources and economic potential.  Its varied terrain ranges from the mountainous, densely populated regions of the east to the thinly populated, natural resource-rich plains of the west, and from the industrialized north, with its Siberian climate and landscape, to the dry steppes of the center, to the fertile south.  Kazakhstan comprises an area of 2.7 million sq km and has one of the lowest population densities in the world with 19.1 million people.  Kazakhs dominate the country in terms of ethnicity, with Russians making up just over a quarter of the population and smaller minorities making up the rest.  Islam is experiencing a revival in Kazakhstan after being suppressed under Soviet rule when about 2 million Russians immigrated there during the campaign to develop virgin territories.  Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, oil sector investment has been the driving force behind the country's rapid economic growth.  Here's What Happened  Kazakhstan had been a highly advanced autocracy under its former president Nursultan Nazarbayev for three decades after gaining independence from the Soviet Union.  Nazarbayev appointed Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as his successor in 2019. He implemented a controlled transfer of power while retaining control over the security council until protests over fuel prices that started on January 2, 2022, turned into the biggest confrontation over the country's direction since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Tokayev sacked the prime minister and other government officials in response to the uproar and reinstated the gas subsidies.  In a shocking move, the president also dismissed his predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev from his position as chair of the national security council, which had given him authority over the country's strategic policy as well as the right to veto most of Tokayev's decisions.  The protests, however, continued unabated. Therefore, Tokayev appealed for help from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a Russia-led security alliance.  A contingent of 2,500 peacekeeping soldiers arrived in the country within hours. It was the organization's first mission since its creation in 2002.  Kazakhstan authorities banned foreign journalists from entering the country during the unrest and implemented a nationwide internet blackout that curbed information flow to the outside world.  During the clashes, more than 160 people were reported dead, including law enforcement officers. A crackdown on the riots led to the arrest of almost 10,000 people, the Financial Times  , citing official sources.  Tokayev's narrative on January 7 appeared to be that terrorist gangs exploited the unrest with an apparent intent to seize power with the help of foreign support, and that CSTO troops only defended critical infrastructure, without intervening to supress the uprising.  Since the unrest was quelled, all CSTO troops have left Kazakhstan, Russian ambassador to Kazakhstan Aleksei Borodavkin  on January 19.  Who Stands Behind the Uprising?  In an attempt to ease discontent, President Tokayev reversed the gas price increase and sacked the entire government. Then why didn't that help stop the unrest? One of the reasons is that people in Kazakhstan are highly dissatisfied with how wealth is distributed in their resource-rich country.  What can appease an angry mob? Probably nothing. As soon as dissent morphs into something like that, you are generally powerless. So there wasn't much Tokayev could do to make people feel happy and go home. They wanted a total change to the regime.  Kazakhstan has some of the world's largest oil reserves and is the world's largest uranium producer. However, the nation's wealth is confined to an elite group associated with the family of the president, and most Kazakhs don't benefit from natural resource exploitation.  The writing was probably on the wall for Tokayev. Back in 2019, mass protests brought down Nazarbayev, so these protests could have had the same effect. To avoid this, he brought in the big dogs (CSTO). For now, it appears that President Tokayev is the biggest winner of the current crisis.  Moreover, insiders say tensions were growing between the two leaders' offices. Over time, Tokayev's power and control over the national bureaucracy grew. Since the beginning of the COVID pandemic, Nazarbayev has rarely appeared in public, and was visibly fatigued. The current protests have given Tokayev a chance to undermine the basis of the dual power system.  As a way of distancing himself from Nazarbayev, Tokayev said that discontent with income inequality among the people was justified and that associates of Nazarbayev should share their wealth. The president talked about initiatives to reduce the wealth gap and eliminate irregularities in state procurements and business relationships with Nazarbayev associates.  According to another view, it was Nazarbaev who orchestrated the unrest in order to overthrow Tokayev and hand the presidency to his daughter.  Akezhan Kazhegeldin, an exiled opposition leader,  that Nazarbayev's allies paid radicals to turn peaceful protests violent. ""(Their) aim was very simple. They tried to regain power, to get back into office, dismiss Tokayev and call a new election, and probably they believed that some of them were going to be elected,"" Kazhegeldin said.  Since the crisis began, Nazarbayev has been out of the spotlight, with rumor mills churning and speculation rampant that the enormously wealthy ex-president fled the country with a large part of his family.  Why Does This Matter to Crypto?  Kazakhstan is a major Bitcoin player. After China clamped down on cryptocurrency mining last year, the nation became the second-largest Bitcoin mining hub, according to a  from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. Kazakhstan contributed 18.1% to the global hash rate as of August 2021.  BTC.com data cited in The Guardian  shows that hashrates for major Bitcoin mining pools declined 14 percent during the protests, emphasizing how important Kazakhstan is to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin price plunged too, hitting below $43,000 in one of those days.  Meanwhile, the negative environmental impacts of Bitcoin mining have been a continuous concern in many countries, and Kazakhstan is no exception. More than 70 percent of Kazakhstan's electricity is produced by burning coal, making it the  of carbon dioxide in Central Asia.  Kazakhstan's government  last year that it would crack down on unregistered miners whose consumption is estimated to be twice that of registered ones.  For as long as Tokayev remains president, he will likely stick with his previous course of favoring Bitcoin miners and seeking alternative energy sources for them. Thus, the president  plans for a nuclear power plant, a logical decision given that it is the world's biggest uranium producer.  However, the country has a history of nuclear disasters, so many people are wary of this idea. As a result, the president must strike a balance between satisfying his country's people so they don't rebel again, and allowing the booming crypto sector to flourish in Kazakhstan.  The government's plan to uproot unregistered mining activity and improve the regulation of the country's crypto mining sector is seen as a way to bring more stability and clarity to the industry in the country. However, Bitcoin miners fear the political crisis may keep the government from taking action.  Despite the uprising and the common power outages miners have experienced since arriving in Kazakhstan, miners fear that it might not be worth leaving the country. To bring the devices to the United States, for example, would take weeks, and they could actually be damaged during the shipping process.  Thus, crypto mining companies will look to stay in Kazakhstan, possibly contributing to the country achieving the required levels of power generation. A number of these firms already expressed an interest in investing in upcoming energy projects like wind power and hydropower stations. Ultimately, it comes down to the government that seems quite interested in seeing a crypto industry grow in Kazakhstan once it settles its internal political crisis.  P.S.

"301",525,2022-01-24,"Blockchain.News","The Central Bank of Russia (CBR) is going on the offensive in relation to the digital currency ecosystem in the country as the apex bank is calling for a blanket ban on crypto-related activities.  In a newly  titled Cryptocurrencies: Trends, risks, measures, the bank draws a close comparison between the nascent world of crypto and Ponzi schemes, saying both have similarities.  Advocating for a ban on the use of digital currencies either in the form of trading or mining throughout Russia, the Kremlin is looking to set a new precedent that will offset the balance the industry has enjoyed for the past few months. The report proposes that the  on the industry should be reinforced with punishments for offenders.  The authors of the report are further convinced that an outright ban is a way to go, seeing cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt the country's financial sovereignty and could aid people in taking money out of the national economy.  Russia is particularly concerned that the offset cryptocurrencies will introduce in the mid to long term is not healthy for the country as well as other emerging markets.  Potential financial stability risks associated with cryptocurrencies are much higher for emerging markets, including Russia, the report reads.  When China  Bitcoin mining last year, miners migrated their hardware to neighbouring countries including Kazakhstan and Russia. In fact, Russia became the third-largest country in terms of hashrate distribution, and the proposed ban by the CBR will further offset the balance in the industry.  Anto Paroian, Chief Operating Officer, at cryptocurrency hedge fund ARK36, believes the uncertain ban will outlaw any crypto mining activities. As this would negatively affect Bitcoin's hashrate, some investors may be wondering whether the ban, when enforced, could result in more selling pressure on the price of this asset.  Russia only hosts a little more than 10% of Bitcoin's current mining power. When and if the ban is finally enforced - which could still take some time - Russian miners may be forced to move their operations elsewhere but any effect of this development on Bitcoin's price will be extremely short-lived.  In arguing why Bitcoin mining should be banned, the report highlighted the threat to energy infrastructure, as well as the demand for trading venues with a constant supply of new coins.  Crypto mining creates a non-productive electricity expenditure, which undermines the energy supply of residential buildings, social infrastructure, and industrial objects, as well as the environmental agenda of the Russian Federation.  The report is presented as a call for feedback from the general public, who are expected to take a stance against the proposition to ban Bitcoin and other cryptos as against the regulation option.  Expectations of a dip in the bitcoin market after the Russian banks' proposal came crashing down as the largest digital currency by market value rose as much as 4.2% to $43,463 during New York trading hours.  Observers had been expecting a major selloff similar to the one that came after China announced a similar ban last year."
"302",344,2022-01-21,"Blockchain.News","The Vice-Chair of the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), Erik Thed en, has taken an unpopular stance against the use of renewable energy for all Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining operations.  In an  with the Financial Times, Thed en said the use of renewable energy can derail member nations from focusing on the climate change goals set out by the bloc.  From Thed en's standpoint, cryptocurrencies are not bad in themselves, a position that was gleaned from his advocacy for a switch to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mining. With the market watchdog calling Bitcoin mining a National Issue, he pointed out that member states must place a special exception to the activities, adding that;  We need to have a discussion about shifting the industry to a more efficient technology.  While the energy utilization of Bitcoin mining is very obvious, debating a way forward remained at the forefront of major industry stakeholders in the past few years. Last year, the  of Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency-related activities further placed the subject as a matter of urgency, with industry players devising modalities to shift their energy options to a renewable one.  Despite industry stakeholders being unable to agree on whether Bitcoin mining is good for the environment or not, as many proponents have presented arguments in favour of mining, many have agreed that  to renewable energy sources is a better bet moving forward.  American electric motor manufacturer, Tesla Inc, announced its plans to reintroduce Bitcoin payments when the bulk of energy powering Bitcoin mining comes from renewable or clean energy sources. Many Bitcoin mining companies are also exploring avenues to tap energy from clean sources, a move that many believe will be economical and environmentally friendly in the long run.  Thed en's call against the use of renewable energy for Bitcoin mining is concerning and might sway policymakers in a direction that places additional strain on BTC and other PoW coins in the near future."

Per the tech giant's , the initiative will be handled by Veritree, a startup that specializes in using blockchain technology to track every stage involved in the tree planting process.  The Samsung tree planting initiative is billed to be completed in the first half of this year, with the tropical trees expected to restore roughly 200 hectares of land and sequester roughly one billion pounds of Cabon dioxide (CO2) over a 25-year period. Veritree's acclaimed tree planting role will help in deploying blockchain technology to verify and track every step of the reforestation process.  Samsung's sustainability journey is an ongoing and multi-faceted one. Investing in tech innovations, such as those that create efficiency improvements and minimize waste, in combination with nature-based solutions, are vital in the fight against climate change, said Mark Newton, Head of Corporate Sustainability at Samsung Electronics America. Drawing on our history of open collaboration, we're teaming up with veritree for the tree-planting initiative as an added way to contribute to a better global society.  While the cost of the project was not disclosed, the nobility of the exercise was well acclaimed. Trees are very crucial in combating climate change as they trap CO2 which are useful to plants in food manufacture. Trees remain one of the most endangered life forms as humans cut them down for use in furniture and construction. The Madagascar mangrove is one of the most deforested ecosystems in the world, thus accounting for the Samsung initiative in the region.  Reforestation is one of the best ways to fight climate change. By collaborating with verities, eco-conscious brands like Samsung that aim to do good for our planet instead of just less harm can have accurate, ground-level data on their tree planting impact, said Derrick Emsley, Co-Founder, and CEO of verities. Our mission is to make it simple to incorporate nature-based solutions into any business model and we're excited by our strategic partnership with Samsung.  The initiative reaffirms the suitability of blockchain technology in helping to drive accountability in relation to sustainability activities. Prior to Samsung, other tech firms including Volvo have used Blockchain in climate-related programs in the past as  by Blockchain.News."

Chinese regulators will be looking forward to using the casino licensing opportunity to test the digital yuan in 2022, Reuters reported.  Among many other casino companies in Macau, Sands China and Wynn Macau have shown eagerness to participate in the government's plan.  The government authorities have also pitched ideas like appointing agents to supervise daily casino operations, according to Reuters.  Last November, when central bank governor Yi Gang suggested China's newly developed cryptocurrency could be useful for fighting crime such as money-laundering and resolving complex cross-border payments problems, Macau might have been one of the places in mind.  In December, junket operator Suncity's boss Alvin Chao was implicated in a probe into illegal gaming, forcing his casinos to be completely shut down. Suncity facilitated bets for wealthy VIPs, a market segment worth around $8 billion in gaming revenue the year before COVID-19 struck, Reuters reported.  Using Macau as a testbed for digital payments would benefit Beijing's desire for greater oversight of cash flows and customers and since the casino hub is situated outside Chinese capital controls, the city is considered an ideal place to test the technology before rolling it out more widely in the mainland.  According to Bernstein analysts estimate, the average high roller lost over $27,000 on each visit to the tables in Macau.  A senior Chinese central bank official said that some 140 million people had registered ""wallets"" for the new digital yuan as of October and used it for transactions totalling around $9.7 billion, according to a Reuters report from November 2021.  Although 2022 is likely to be the year for e-CNY, no official launch date for the digital currency has been announced yet.  Since China's ban of decentralised cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the digital yuan is predicted to substitute them.  According to a Blockchain.News report, China implemented its zero-tolerance policy for Bitcoin mining in May 2021, with a series of crackdowns on miners that finally led to the exodus of mining firms from the Asian nation. Beijing's negative stance about crypto miners is fueled by the supposed environmental impact as the majority of the nation's power source comes from coal.  Eventually, Chinese miners found the right footing by relocating to other areas like the United States."

In addition, the cryptocurrencies trading market has also experienced high volatility over the past twelve months. This feature will let readers go through key milestones and reviews of major events before the end of this year.  Bitcoin breaks All-Time-High  Investors have acknowledged the volatility among various tokens trading this year, but the fluctuation also pushed major cryptos to an all-time high, breaking serval records for the first time.  The price of Bitcoin reached the all-time-high (ATH) of $68.789K on Nov. 10, according to the data provided by CoinMarketCap. Experts indicated that there were serval bullish factors before the Proshares Bitcoin ETF, pushing the price to the relative ATH.

Thanks to SEC Chairmen Gensler's pro-crypto stance, the bullish sentiment continued for serval weeks before the recent drop in December. The market expects more Bitcoin future-related derivatives financial products and bitcoin-linked ETF products to roll out under Gensler's leadership.  El Salvador first to adopt Bitcoin for legal tender  Favourable news not only came from ProShares Bitcoin future ETF. The crypto industry also embraced a new era when Central America's El Salvador passed a law in June to accept Bitcoin as payment for goods or services. In September, it officially became the first country to start accepting Bitcoin as fiat money along with the U.S. dollar.  To further raise awareness and increase cryptocurrency adoption, President Nayib Bukele's administration  the digital currency to the public, encouraging them to use the crypto wallet -  . Besides, the administration speeded up the rollout by  over a hundred crypto ATMs to build the first  . Furthermore, the country will use the profit generated from the cryptocurrency to build new  .

Bukele emphasised the benefit of adopting Bitcoin that help overseas workers save transactions fees for remittance. In addition, the process of crypto  would be environmental-friendly enough, supported by volcanic-generated electricity in the country.  Yet, many citizens have still doubted the sustainability of crypto adoption; even international financial institutions, like the IMF, warned of the  of Bitcoin adoption in the country. Nevertheless, more and more firms, like Starbucks and McDonald's, were  Bitcoin as the payment method in this country.  New milestone for the development of CBDC  This year, the development of central bank digital currency (CBDC) also pursued a significant milestone. In October, Nigeria rolled out its  and became the first African country to adopt CBDC. President Buhari believes e-Naria would help the country boost the economy's growth and GDP by $29 billion over the next decade.  A retail CBDC is one of the digital forms of money that is issued by the central bank and can be compared to physical banknotes. Retail CBDC can be used in financial transactions both online and offline.  In Asia, as the Beijing Winter Olympic is approaching, China intends to escalate the influence of e-CNY or digital yuan before the games begin in Feb 2022 .

The price was subject to a series of sentiments of fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) and the performance of bear sentiment among foreign oppression among regulators worldwide.  In June, the Chinese Communist Party-led government continued a series of legal actions against crypto mining activities. Reportedly, more than 90% of crypto mining capacity has been  after several major mining facilities in China have been disconnected without electricity provision. These actions were described as a crackdown against the crypto sector. The legal actions forced the hash rate in China to drop significantly, resulting in an exodus of Chinese crypto miners emigrating to overseas countries, such as Kazakhstan, the U.S. or Russia.  The crackdown continued throughout the year, including crypto as payment tools. The Chinese central bank called all crypto-related transactions  and was unable to enjoy the same legal status as legal tender. Serval crypto data  were also unable to access the Chinese market, including CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko and TradingView.  Yet, the general hash rate of Bitcoin seems to have returned to normal and recovered by even  an all-time high in December.  Person of the year : Elon Musk  Intensified oppressions against the crypto activities among regulators was not the only factor affecting the crypto market; individual influence also escalated the uncertainty of cryptos' fluctuation.  In early December, Time magazine named Elon Musk Person of the Year . Musk's multiple identities include the CEO of Tesla, Chief Engineer of SpaceX, strengthening his influence across various sectors and industries.  In addition, his soft power also reflects the crypto sector as a strong opinion leader.

NFTs  In 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFT) have drawn heavy public attention. The most eye-catching and the biggest sale of an NFT so far came from an auction of Beeple's Everydays: the First 5,000 days in March, sold for an eye-popping $69.3 million. The auction has pursued a new wave of innovations across various sectors, like , , also promoted by  and .  In addition, many well-known opinion leaders, including , U.S. filmmaker  participated in the NFT market. Stakeholders of NFTs expect the market would be much more active in the coming year.  Outlook ahead 2022  Stepping forward into 2022, Huong Hauduc, General Counsel, digital asset prime brokerage and exchange BEQUANT, believes the stance of China and the U.S. will still influence the crypto market development, he said:  China's actions, whether this is continuing to crack down on crypto or loosening its grip on the digital assets space, will be a key indicator for future regulation across the world. The U.S. appears to be moving at a federal level, with mayors  salaries in Bitcoin and miners taking advantage of cheaper energy, but it remains to be seen if they take the bold actions of its allies in South America and see Bitcoin or other coins, such as Tether, as legal tender.  On the other hand, Hauduc suggests the voice calling for crypto regulation, whether it be for tighter consumer protection or just clarity of the rules for institutions, are getting much louder.  Over the past 12 months, experts have observed that institutions signal a change in their preferences and start favouring digital assets over gold as a reserve asset, Loukas Lagoudis, Executive Director at crypto/digital assets hedge fund ARK36, commented. To compare with specific crypto coins, Ethereum is expected to continue to gain ground against Bitcoin, at least in the medium term, as its importance for institutional investors will continue to grow, Lagoudis added.  It is projected that the sustained adoption of digital assets by institutional investors and their further integration into the legacy financial systems will be the main drivers of growth of the crypto space in the next year, Lagoudis said."

Here, ChangeNOW’s Pauline Shangett summarizes what we know about regulation developments as we approach the end of 2021 and what we can expect in 2022 and beyond.  Whatever your feelings toward cryptocurrencies might be, their acceptance is growing rapidly, with global crypto-asset capitalization exceeding $2 trillion amid increased institutional demand and new uses of technology.  According to Chainalysis’ data, global adoption has increased by more than 2,300% since 2019 and over 881% in 2020.    Source: Chainalysis Global Cryptocurrency Adoption Index measured between July 2020 and June 2021.  On November 23, 2021, the daily number of newly created BTC addresses reached 709,160 - the highest figure this year.    Source: IntoTheBlock  As crypto acceptance grows, financial institutions and governments are recognizing it's not a fringe phenomenon. Previously skeptic institutional investors have rethought their opinions after seeing some of the incredible returns crypto offers.  Crypto regulations fragmented globally  Currently, there is no centralized authority that regulates the digital asset class worldwide, and governments or regulators stick to their own policies. As crypto products come in a variety of forms, it’s hard for regulators to establish a unified framework. The taxation and income laws also vary across countries, which makes regulation more challenging.  While some government officials turn the screw on the industry, others are warming up to cryptocurrencies. El Salvador, for example, became the world's first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender earlier this year.** **  Meanwhile, China clamped down hard on Bitcoin trading and mining, declaring it illegal. In contrast, Singapore has clear licensing regimes for crypto firms, making them as legitimate as traditional financial companies. In some countries like India it is still a matter of debate how to regulate digital tokens, with all the time.  In Brazil, a bill regulating Bitcoin and cryptocurrency was approved on December 7, 2021. After being debated and approved by senators, it will be ready to be signed into law.  To operate in Canada, cryptocurrency exchanges still must be registered with Canadian Securities Administrators (Canada’s version of the SEC) and follow its regulatory guidelines as confirmed in a March 2021  by the CSA.  The United Kingdom has stepped up efforts to develop and implement crypto-specific policies following Brexit. Although the UK government declared all digital assets would be considered 'property' in 2020, no laws or guidelines exist yet for digital assets. In November 2021, the deputy governor of the Bank of England warned that crypto assets pose a risk to the British financial system unless they are urgently regulated.  In the European Union, cryptocurrencies are legal and governments can choose to oversee crypto exchanges. The EU recently enacted new anti-money laundering directives (AMLD5 and AMLD6) that tighten requirements for KYC/CFT and standard reporting for service providers.  However, all eyes are on the United States' regulators, who have been closely monitoring the virtual currency industry for several years, grappling with how to regulate the more than $2 trillion market.  The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued  to assist those in the virtual currency industry comply with OFAC sanctions. It also updated its  and commented on the digital asset space in its . Each document echoes the need to enhance institutional capability and knowledge in the rapidly evolving space of digital assets and services.  Various US federal agencies are working together to establish robust regulatory policies for cryptocurrencies, especially stablecoins, including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), and Federal Trade Commission (FTC). At the same time, the IRS and the Department of Justice have continued to  crypto cases.  Meanwhile, several US crypto firms presented their technologies to Congress on December 8, 2021, to argue that they have great potential for the future and to call for a clear and adapted regulatory environment for the sector.  Participants discussed various topics, including customer protection, regulatory oversight, crypto competition from other countries, environmental sustainability, the pros and cons of stablecoins, US dollar dominance, ransomware, security, transaction tracking, as well as the illicit use of cryptocurrency. Another round of hearings will target participants who will be less supportive of cryptos. Regulators are expected to consider this hearing when deciding the regulatory framework.  According to Jerome Powell, the Fed is evaluating whether it should establish its CBDC and will release a whitepaper on digital currencies soon. However, he did make it clear that the US is not planning to ban cryptocurrencies like China.  With all this in mind, here’s an overview of how things might evolve in the near future.  Crypto Regulation to Be Coordinated at a Global Level  In my view, a very likely scenario for the future of crypto regulation is the one outlined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  IMF officials  they are planning to develop a global regulatory framework for crypto assets in collaboration with the Financial Stability Board and other international regulators.  The regulatory framework would apply to providers of crypto firms who offer critical services like asset transferring and storage, similar to those governing financial services institutions.  Stablecoins and crypto assets would have different requirements based on their major use cases. Crypto investment products and services, for example, would be regulated by the same regulator as securities brokers and dealers.  As with bank deposits, crypto payment services and products would have to meet the same standards as bank deposits, and would be supervised by the central bank or the payments authority.  To engage in crypto, institutions would have to comply with strict requirements, including limitations on their exposure to digital assets. While waiting for that to happen, every country has an array of regulatory and compliance frameworks, some carefully developed and some implemented hurriedly. However, there's no denying that the growing prominence of cryptocurrencies will have an impact on decision-making in governments and regulators going forward.

Trackgood partners with Caffè Barbera to provide coffee supply chain traceability  Several brands are currently utilising Trackgood to bring traceability and transparency to their supply processes and improve their relationships with their consumers and the environment.  , the oldest coffee roasting company in Italy, is one of those companies. Through Trackgood, Caffè Barbera began embracing the blockchain to validate its supply chain and share the long journey of its coffee - from the plantation to the cup - with its customers.  Elio Barbera, MD of Café Barbera, said: ”Thanks to the implementation of a decentralised blockchain protocol capable of validating our precious supply chain and demonstrating to our consumers the long journey of coffee, from the plantation to the cup, we have emphasized an aspect that is fundamental for us: To make known to all the positive impact that a shared policy between all the players in the supply chain can have on society and the environment.”  For a company that started over 150 years ago, this was a bold step in keeping up with the times, especially since the use of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is increasing on a daily basis. In fact, the roastery even allows its consumers to purchase their favourite coffee using cryptocurrency on its eCommerce site.  By scanning a QR code on their smartphones, Caffè Barbera users can discover the places and faces of those who make sure that coffee gets to their table. They can access the images of plantations, profiles of the farmers, the quality certificates, lot numbers, and even travel documents.

The global financial institution whose membership comprises the majority of the world's Central Banks believes the disillusionment is centred on the wrong premise that the space is decentralized. In the real sense, its governing operations are largely centralized.  According to the BIS, decentralization illusion in DeFi existed since the need for governance makes some level of centralization inevitable, and structural aspects of the system lead to a concentration of power. If DeFi were to become widespread, its vulnerabilities might undermine financial stability. These can be severe because of high leverage, liquidity mismatches, built-in interconnectedness, and the lack of shock absorbers such as banks.  With the clamour for the regulation of DeFi growing in recent times, the BIS said, existing governance mechanisms in DeFi would provide natural reference points for authorities in addressing issues related to financial stability, investor protection, and illicit activities.  The Obvious Flaws with DeFi  The BIS took the centralization narrative with a new description noting that DeFi protocols are more related to corporations. Governance powers are typically vested on a few large coin holders or insiders during token sale exercises.  The bank also criticized the high leverage that is very peculiar to crypto entities, most of which it said can be strained by liquidity mismatches, built-in interconnectedness, and the lack of shock-absorbing capacity the way banks are wired.  The BIS also talked down on the rise in the use of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), stating that the presence of high gas fees at each point in the utilization process of these platforms makes them more relatively costly use. Despite these apparent flaws, the BIS pointed out that the usage of DEXs is growing at a fast pace due to the anonymity and greater control they seem to offer.  Many crypto proponents believe that DeFi is the future of finance, one that can benefit from being . Away from the fears of sustainability, many are choosing to do away with warnings from global watchdogs, including the BIS, to pursue more inclusion with DeFi."

Warren, in a letter to CEO of Greenidge Generation Holdings Jeff Kirt, inquired about the aforementioned concerns on Thursday afternoon.  Highlighting her concerns, Massachusetts' Democratic US senator Warren wrote in the letter stating that: given the extraordinarily high energy usage and carbon emissions associated with Bitcoin mining, mining operations at Greenidge and other plants raise concerns about their impacts on the global environment, on local ecosystems, and on consumer electricity costs.  This is the first time that Warren has pushed a specific bitcoin mining firm for information. We need to better understand how much energy facilities like Greenidge are using, how much they're emitting into the environment, and what impact they're having on electricity prices for American consumers, Warren told Bloomberg media in an email.  Greenidge will respond to Warren to shed light on how the facility meets all of New York's nation-leading environmental standards, is bringing economic opportunity to an under-served area of the state and is a model for crypto mining with widespread local support, the company mentioned in a statement.  Greenidge, which is managed by private equity firm Atlas Holdings LLC, has come under scrutiny for its rising electricity consumption which has increased to almost as much as the entire nation of Argentina's energy usage.  According to its website, the firm uses low carbon sources of electricity for its mining operations and purchases carbon offsets credits. It also stated that the electricity used for its New York mining plant is generated by natural gas.  Greenidge, which claims to be the first carbon-neutral bitcoin mining company in the US, has one mining facility in upstate New York and has plans to install another one in South Carolina.  Earlier this year, Greenidge's mining facility in New York obtained much criticism. Environmentalists complained against the idea of the power station burning natural gas to mine Bitcoin and operate its cooling system, alleging that such activities have a negative impact on the local lake.  Big Fight Brewing Over Crypto  Raising issues against Greenidge generation firm is not the first time that Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken aim at the cryptocurrency sector over its adverse impact on consumers, the financial system, and the environment.  The long-standing critic sees cryptocurrency as a new shadow bank. According to her, a shadow bank is a non-bank financial entity that offers services outside the remit of normal banking regulation. In July, Warren a member of the Senate Banking Committee and a longtime critic of the nation's largest banks  to the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to identify and remedy risks posed by crypto assets and to draft a comprehensive and coordinated framework through which federal agencies can continually regulate virtual coins.  While some investors choose to buy Bitcoin as an investment hedge, Warren also told CNBC media in July that she is sceptical that the cryptocurrency will prove to be a reliable hedge against inflation over the long run. She  that cryptocurrency is not going to have its own inflationary pressures, stating that inflation comes from a different source than what happens with the dollar, and also pointed out the high volatility in the crypto prices.  In September, in a Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing, Warren argued that the high and unpredictable fees on cryptocurrency present severe risks to investors who have the least money to lose. In response to her question about fees on decentralized crypto exchanges and whether they present a path to greater financial inclusion, U.S. Securities and Exchange (SEC) Commission chairman Gary Gensler  Senator Warren that cryptocurrency does not sound like the path to a more inclusive financial system and instead serves as a highly speculative asset.  As a result, Warren expected chair Gensler and the SEC to take a leading role to ensure that US regulators address crypto's regulatory gaps and ensure that the nation is building the inclusive financial system that it needs."
"318",318,2021-12-06,"Blockchain.News","The non-fungible tokens (NFTs) sector continues to take the world by storm based on the massive growth experienced. For instance, secondary sales surpassed the $15 billion mark.  Mason Nystrom, a research analyst at Messari Crypto,  :  Over the past year, the NFT landscape emerged from a small ecosystem with a few hundred million in sales volume to a multichain ecosystem amassing billions in capital. The NFT multichain future is emerging with blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Flow, and Ronin leading the way.  With NFTs  to be the revenue model of the Metaverse, the sky seems to be the limit for this sector.  For instance, monthly NFT secondary sales from August have been topping $1 billion, representing a 10 to 20 times surge from the beginning of the year.  Furthermore, OpenSea, a popular marketplace,  $95 million worth of NFT transactions in two days compared to the cumulative volume of $21 million recorded in the entirety of 2020.  What is NFTs' catch?  NFTs are blockchain-based ownership digital assets whose value is pegged on their uniqueness, given that the tokens are non-divisible and have to be bought in their entirety.  As a result, these traits create intrinsic value for NFTs because of their limited supply. NFTs are continuously being embraced in different fields based on the value generated.  For instance, the United Nations recently took its climate change awareness quest a notch higher by  activists, designers, and artists to create NFTs to inspire the global populace to take action against the climate crisis.  The African Blockchain University also  African artists about the value they can harness from the NFT sector. This was expected to generate more wealth creation avenues and bridge the gap between traditional and digital art.  Therefore, NFTs are unravelling a story of wealth, cultural change, and human achievement."
"319",1573,2021-11-30,"Blockchain.News","Although Hong Kong's art scene is already booming lucratively with galleries and auction houses showcasing world-class art pieces, the city is on its way to adding another milestone on its journey with non-fungible tokens (NFTs).  Hong Kong is known for hosting large-scale international art events. In an artprice.com report titled ""Asia: the Art Market's centre of gravity is heading East"", auction houses' results in Hong Kong have been exceptional in 2021, with unsold rates at the lowest in the world: just 10% versus a global average of 30%.  The report also stated that in 2021 alone, the contribution, including China, Hong Kong and Taiwan to the contemporary global market (approximately $1 billion), represented 40% of its value.  According to a report by analytics platform DappRadar, NFT trading volume surged in the third quarter of 2021 to $10.67 billion, a 704% increase from the previous quarter. Still, the city seems to be yet unleashing itself for exhibiting digital art or NFTs.  An NFT is a unit of data that certifies the uniqueness, authenticity, and ownership of a digital asset stored on a digital ledger called a blockchain which benefits an artist's authenticity and the asset's owner. It can represent real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos.  Although NFTs are becoming an increasingly popular way to buy and sell digital artwork, the value of NFTs remains volatile since they are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency.  After a buyer purchases the original NFT, the buyer will also enjoy ownership of the digital artwork's built-in authentication, which is proof of ownership. Collectors value those ""digital bragging rights"" almost more than the item itself.  NFTs have been around since 2014, but it only got its shot to fame this year following Christie's first sale of a purely digital artwork of artist Beeple's ""Everydays: The First 5000 Days"", which fetched almost $70 million.  The financial hub breeds various crypto-driven firms  Hong Kong has showcased its attributes in becoming a fintech innovation hub by giving birth to ""some of the most established and successful crypto companies to date, including the crypto exchange FTX and the digital asset platform Crypto.com, and HK-based Animoca Brands,""  Speaking in an emailed interview with Blockchain.News, Gary Liu, CEO of the  said he is optimistic towards the NFT market in the city :  ""The future of NFTs is bright in Hong Kong as a centre for financial innovation and an emerging global arts and culture hub. A few trends give evidence to this based on how the Hong Kong arts community has embraced NFT and the city's ambitions to grow its reputation as a major fintech hub,""  Liu added that ""in recent years, the city has also been bolstering fintech bona fides and attracting startups, including leading NFT and digital asset players.""  NFT overturns traditional art market  Focusing on digital art in Hong Kong, the NFT scene is burgeoning with sporadic exhibitions and auctions.  Via such initiatives, local Hong Kong artists have begun to gain exposure to the world of digital assets where peer to peer transaction is simpler, cutting out the hassle of intermediaries.  For this year's  a fund-raising initiative organised by SCMP and RTHK since 1988, SCMP invited five Hong Kong artists to mint and auction NFT of their original artworks.  Within the first week of the auction, three out of 8 listed pieces were sold, and 4 out of 5 auction pieces have received bids. The artworks were on display at Start Art Gallery in Hong Kong's K11 Musea until Nov 21.  The newspaper's broader efforts to promote NFTs as a technology that facilitates dialogue is a significant step towards popularising NFTs among the masses in Hong Kong; other international gigs in the city are also educating the general public and inspiring artists.  When top-tier auction house Phillips sold artist Banksy's ""Laugh Now Panel A"" in Hong Kong on June 2021 for HK$24,450,000 ( 2.2million), it marked the first time a major auction house in Asia ever accepted Bitcoin or Ether as payment for physical artwork.  Although Banksy is a well-known artist, such auctions and exhibitions with blockchain technology aiding NFTs can help discover talented artists who have otherwise remained unseen in the traditional art market.  The use of NFTs has already started in various fields such as gaming as profitable digital assets. On the flip side, some initiatives brought forward by companies such as SCMP are creating NFTS to give back to causes such as the environment and local communities.  In October, the ImpactNFT Exhibition invited collectors and NFT enthusiasts to experience and purchase digital artworks with themes constructed around the 17 Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations: including the fight against climate change, equality and equity in education, and gender equality.  While in October 2021, Digital Art Fair Asia became the first-ever art fair in Hong Kong to feature world-class NFT digital art and an immersive art experience, which lasted for 18 days.  The fair showcased over 200 digital and NFT artworks that allowed the public to understand more about NFTs, while art enthusiasts and collectors could hunt for items to add to their collection. Liu talked about the NFT market development of the city.  ""Hong Kong's role as a major financial hub and a burgeoning centre for contemporary art make it a strong contender as the crypto and NFT hub in Asia,""  Hong Kong enjoys Crypto-friendly facilities  According to a study by Crypto Head titled ""The 2021 Crypto-Ready Index"", Hong Kong  fourth among 200 countries and territories worldwide in terms of ""crypto-ready countries."" This result indicates that the public is well aware of the potential of cryptos.  The study also showed that Hong Kong's annual online search for crypto increased by 102.1%, and the yearly crypto google searches were at 10,356 per 100,000 people. While the study also showed that there were 124 crypto ATMs or 60,276 people per ATM.  According to their websites, Blockchain Association of Hong Kong and Hong Kong NFT Association are backing to ""advocate for the development of proportionate and effective regulation while attracting greater investment and talent into Hong Kong Blockchain Development,"" and ""improve the rules in the production, circulation, and transaction of products in the NFT field"" in Hong Kong.  The artprice.com report also highlighted the importance of the Asian market as the world's primary zone for exchanging Contemporary artworks, including NFTs, including artists from both the east and a growing number from the west.  Hong Kong's role as a significant financial hub on a worldwide scale is already a well-established fact. Still, its burgeoning contemporary art also makes it a strong contender as a crypto and NFT hub in Asia and globally.  The city sees a potential future as a leading hub for annual NFT events similar to this year's NFT.NYC, which hosted 5,500+ attendees, hundreds of leading speakers and the best projects in digital art.  ""The city's exhibition industry is robust, and its love for art, culture, and technology continues to expand. Art Basel, RISE, and HK Fintech Week are evidence that this city can absolutely host a globally impactful blockchain and NFT conference,"" Liu said when asked about Hong Kong's potential in hosting major NFT events.  Hong Kong is receiving more attention for NFT launches due to tight crypto regulations and crackdowns in mainland China, many Chinese celebrities are choosing to launch NFT collections in the city instead.  According to a report by SCMP in October, some of the biggest names in Hong Kong's entertainment world including Wong Kar-wai, Gigi Yim and Hins Cheung have unveiled respective NFT projects.  These projects further indicate that these once-niche digital tokens might be on their way to wider acceptance among the general public, collectors and art enthusiasts.  The future of NFT?  Although the hype around NFTs have made people believe this form of digital assets will change how people invest, some sceptics believe that these could be a bubble similar to the dot-com craze.  According to a March report by The New York Times (NYT), NFT fractional ownership ventures - in which tradable tokens at affordable price points, pegged to the value of desirable digital assets, are divided among a group of buyers - is particularly seen as ""disturbing"".  The main index of Mei-Moses, a database of auction sales, now owned by Sotheby's, shows that during the past decade, the overall value of the many thousands of artworks resold at auction has not increased.  In an interview with NYT, Mei-Moses' founder Michael Moses said, ""how do you value what's being fractionalised? Value is something incorporated over time, not added in an instant"". Cutting up expensive digital items into tradable tokens made the market ""fraught with volatility,"" he added. ""Basically, it's gambling. You have no idea of the true value of the work.""  Sceptics state that people should be aware of their investments since the speculations in digital assets such as NFTs that have no physical existence flourished during the COVID-19 pandemic when people spent a lot of time indoors."
"320",991,2021-11-29,"Blockchain.News","Many people were over-excited when the news about Ethereum 2.0 broke out. However, the upgraded system to the already existing Ethereum blockchain has not fixed issues associated with transactions, scalability, and sustainability.  Ethereum 2.0 has left a major common problem, front-running, which crypto investors are still facing. This problem continues causing the loss of thousands of dollars and other more losses.  Investors are now joyous with the news that , a popular third-generation blockchain, announced its EMV, which is described as having the capability to solve the front-running problem and many more. Therefore, it is important to examine how Telos solves this problem and outperform other systems.  Telos EVM   (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is a compatible layer-one blockchain that offers a scalable solution to run existing solidity applications and vyper contracts without modifications.  Telos EVM was built to revolutionize the DeFi landscape and to fix problems faced by other EVMs. Each part of Telos appears to solve different problems commonly witnessed in other networks. Telos EVM just functions like Ethereum but is different from the original EVM. The platform was developed to host a number of large programs from other networks without modifying anything.  Tackling Front-running Problem  Ethereum miners mainly use front-running to improve their spread while entering options and futures contracts.  However, front-running is a common problem in the crypto industry. This problem causes millions of dollars to drain in trading, and many users lose millions of dollars even without knowing.  The front-running problem occurs when bots or miners with insider knowledge about pending trades make a profit from it. Bots could offer a high gas fee to jump lines over high-value transactions, and even miners take bribes or insert their own transactions to get transactions directly.  The involved person can skip lines, complete transactions, and even differentiate between his purchase and sell price as profit. While the attacker is the only one making a profit from this, other general users do not benefit.  Telos solves this problem by having a strict anti-front running rule and a fixed transaction fee. This prevents any possibility for attackers to exploit users. At every second, Telos creates two blocks with a fixed gas fee on EVM transactions. Since EVM is fast, bots have no chance to scan pools for high trades. Moreover, Telos offers rules in that nobody can break these rules. Telos offers transaction processing on a FIFO basis (first-in, first-out); hence block producers cannot reorder any transactions to gain high profits.  Fixing Transaction Issues  Another important area where Telos is seen solving a significant problem the transaction fee concern.  Telos has advanced features such as cost-efficient transactions, fast block times, and fair distribution that significantly benefit developers.  While only a few platforms can boast of offering low transaction fees, native Telos has no fee at all. Telos EVM, which uses the similar gas model used by the original Ethereum, costs $0.01. Telos EVM helps people save thousands of dollars since Ethereum's gas fees are relatively high. With that in mind, Telos outperforms its competitors such as Cardano, Polkadot, and others and beats the original Ethereum down.  The time it takes to mine one block varies typically based on the chain and particular variables. There are various blockchains in the market with a high market cap, such as Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos. And all these cryptocurrencies have a prominent position on the market.  Ethereum is popular and considered the king of decentralized apps. It has scalability problems and typically takes 10 15 seconds to mine one block. Polkadot has not yet launched the Parachains upgrade, allowing individual sidechains to hook on the main blockchain. On the other hand, Cardano recently launched smart contracts. Tezos most projects are still in development, but it can lend well to DeFi and NFTs.  Though such blockchains still boast of offering faster transactions, they still cannot rival Telos EVM. The time which Telos EVM takes to mine one block is less than 500ms. Such a fantastic time block means that Telos can handle 10,000 transactions per second. Telos, therefore, fixes the gap seen in the problem associated with transaction speed.  Harnessing Interoperability  Telos is considered the greenest blockchain due to its low energy consumption levels. It also provides a home to several dApps on its network.  Telos EVM makes it easy for developers to bring existing applications to the Telos blockchain. It is compatible with Vyper, EOSIO C++, and Solidity, providing a new experience for migrating users. The compatibility rate of Telos EVM with other apps is 95% and therefore makes migration much more accessible. With EOSIO, developers can migrate applications from the EOS blockchain to Telos, and for maximum performance, coders will be able to deploy Ethereum DApps on Eosio.  Apart from that, Telos recently announced partnerships with Anyswap, SushiSwap, and a popular NFT project, Cryptopunks. So, users on such platforms can take advantage of Telos EVM's security, speed, and scalability with trading their crypto coins.  Telos Gains Popularity  Telos's functionality to migrate applications from EOS blockchain has gained attention from big brands such Siemens, Zalando, Cisco, and Microsoft. These are just part of the big brand's names using Telos blockchain to unlock real-world activities and build applications. A powerful hackathon platform known as Taikai uses Telos for open innovation events in the next generation. Telos uses a combination of the best of various ecosystems and successfully other benefits on top.  Telos, with its powerful enhancements, solves the weaknesses that other blockchains cannot solve. It will evolve governance solutions, provide network scalability, flexible and low fee models, and no front-running. Telos has become the web 3.0 stack and provides entrepreneurs and developers tools to succeed in the next-generation decentralized internet economy."

Based on the partnership, Ripple will help the Pacific island nation develop a U.S. dollar-backed digital currency that facilitates cross-border payments.  The government of Palau aims to provide its people with an alternative to bank currencies with expanded financial access.  Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. talked about the development and said: As part of our commitment to lead in financial innovation and technologies, we are delighted to partner with Ripple. The first phase of the partnership will focus on a cross-border payments strategy and exploring options to create a national digital currency, providing the citizens of Palau with greater financial access.  Ripple is looking forward to assisting Palau to get its own national digital currency, not necessarily just another central bank digital currency (CBDC).  Once Palau gets the national digital currency, authorities will be open to experimenting with its USD-backed stablecoin and related use cases such as a corporate registry on a decentralized public blockchain called XRP ledger (XPRL).  Ripple said that the U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin could provide nations like Palau a potential alternative to CBDC.  The development of the digital currency could lead to the implementation of the world's first government-backed national stablecoin in the first half of 2022.  Ripple would provide Palau with technical, business, design and policy support.  Being an island country, Palau is especially vulnerable to some of the impacts of climate change, and Ripple revealed that this was one of the reasons why it was selected for the job. The U.S.-based technology company, which develops the Ripple payment protocol and exchange network, stated that XRP Ledger is carbon-neutral and 120,000X more energy-efficient than Proof-of-Work blockchains.  We are excited to be working with Palau to achieve its financial and climate-related goal. We have a wonderful opportunity to bring together our technology and experience with the unique characteristics of Palau to make a real economic and social impact for the country, said James Wallis, vice-president of central bank engagements at Ripple.  Palau's Digital Currency and What It Means  The call for  has also been felt in Palau. In November 2020, Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. urged Palau Congress to consider introducing a bill that would create digital residency and accommodate individuals and businesses that have adopted cryptocurrency.  In his letter to the members of the Palau National Congress, Whipps stated the digital residency bill is a way for businesses to use Palau's physical location, to transact business digitally.  The bill considered giving digital institutions, such as digital banks, digital securities brokers, or dealers, charters under the operating agreement and exempting them from many of the requirements of the Financial Institutions Act.  Meanwhile, Palau is moving ahead with its plans to make the digital currency its national currency the currency will be a government-issued digital currency. The pacific island urgently uses the USD as the national currency. While the dollar will continue circulating, the digital currency will be the official tender."
"322",602,2021-11-23,"Blockchain.News","U.S. President Joe Biden has  Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chairman after much speculation went around saying that Fed Governor Lael Brainard could replace him to lead the U.S. Central Bank for the next four years.  Meanwhile, President Joe Biden also appointed Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed board, as the agency's Vice Chairperson.  On Monday, November 21, the White House announced that President Biden would nominate Powell to lead the Federal Reserve system's Board of Governors for another four-year term after his present term comes to an end in February 2022.  The executive branch pointed out the decision reached to award Mr. Powell another term in office based on the premised that he played a crucial role while serving as the Fed chair in reducing the economic effect of the Covid-19 pandemic, the generation of 5.6 million jobs, and reducing an unemployment rate at a 4.6%.  With Powell as chairman and Brainard as Vice Chairperson, President Biden mentioned that he expects that the duo will help keep the focus on low inflation, stable prices, and provide more employment for the American people, and also address Biden's stance on climate change.  Biden further stated:  That success is a testament to the economic agenda I've pursued and to the decisive action that the Federal Reserve has taken under Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard to help steer us through the worst downturn in modern American history and put us on the path to recovery.  Together, they also share my deep belief that urgent action is needed to address the economic risks posed by climate change and stay ahead of emerging risks in our financial system, the President elaborated.  Powell was appointed as Fed Chairman by the former President Trump's administration and took office in February 2018, with a four-year term that is set to end in February 2022. His term as a member of the Board of Governors will expire on January 31, 2028.  Stance towards Crypto by Powell And Brainard's Leadership?  Economists believe that the differences between Powell and Brainard are slight, and therefore their leadership decisions would not impact huge differences on the crypto and digital asset markets.  The two leaders share a conviction that crypto-assets should not be allowed to grow unchecked to an extent where they might threaten the existing financial system.  In the past, the duo was seen as a monetary policy dove, meaning they are likely to be more . That might be a positive thing for Bitcoin, given that several investors widely use the crypto asset as a hedge against rising prices.  In the past two years, high-risk investment assets such as cryptocurrencies have witnessed their prices skyrocket. For example, the price of Bitcoin has almost doubled since the beginning of the year. The reason is due to a combination of stimulus checks from the U.S. government, relatively low-interest rates, and rising consumer savings.  If Powell is slow to raise interest rates, investors will likely stay interested in risky bets like crypto coins.  Cryptocurrencies are considered to act as a  against inflation, and advocates claim that since such digital assets have a limited supply, they can't be devalued, unlike the U.S. dollar or other traditional currencies. These investors often view cryptocurrency as a hedge for loose fed policy.  However, there is uncertainty regarding how markets will fare without additional support from the Fed, which will test retail investors' portfolios."
"323",342,2021-11-23,"Blockchain.News","Swedish authorities, including the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and Swedish Environmental Protection, have extended calls  for a European Union-wide ban of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining activities on the grounds that the process jeopardizes the power grid.  France-based investment manager Melanion Capital also faults this supposedly patriotic call, which says the regulator's position is based on misinformation.  The claim that Bitcoin miners jeopardize the electricity network is entirely misinformed. Bitcoin miners are last-recourse electricity consumers, Melanion Capital said in a short note, adding that Bitcoin miners are the most sensitive industry to electricity prices, and their business model collapses entirely when demand for electricity increases, as slight hikes in prices can mean mining activities incur losses.  The investment firm advocated that regulators worldwide should desist from making rules that harm the industry's growth simply because the ecosystem operates in a decentralized manner. There are no individuals to speak for the benefit of all.  The absence of such a political counterbalance [for Bitcoin miners] should not be taken as an opportunity to implement measures rendering illegal an industry for its lack of defensive powers.  The Melanion response to the banning call also drew on the stance of regional governments like Texas, who are exploring avenues to tap into the state's renewable energy resources to mine BTC efficiently and profitably.  In Central America, El Salvador also comes off as a country  clean geothermal energy towards its Bitcoin mining pursuits. There are Bitcoin mining advocates who believe the approach to mining the premier cryptocurrency as well as those of other PoW assets is what determines to a large extent how regulators should classify the industry.  Thus far, miners are  to switch to green energy for their Bitcoin mining processors. While the results may not be visible in the near term, the push by entities into this area gives hope for more mainstream adoption of this approach in the coming years."

The upgrade event is arguably the most remarkable since the Lightning Network and the Segregated Witness upgrades, both of which went live in 2017. The Segregated Witness upgrade led to the hard fork that created the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) cryptocurrency.  Among the fundamental changes the Taproot upgrade introduced is improving the network's scripting capabilities and privacy. The Taproot Upgrade introduced the concept of Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree (MAST), which can help make smart contracts more efficient and private by only revealing the relevant parts of the contract when spending, as detailed by Hampus Sj berg, the developer managing the Taproot website.  Since its inception, Bitcoin has grown to become the most recognized digital currency and the largest by market capitalization. The cryptocurrency  its All-Time High (ATH) above $69,000 more than four days ago, a price trend that has showcased the financial quality of both the retail and institutional funds their digital asset is receiving.  A high level of network sustainability and longevity was also introduced into the network through the Taproot upgrade, with Hampus noting that the network now has the capability to accept more activations up to 100 years. The Taproot upgrade is also billed to help improve the privacy of the Lightning network to make the overall ecosystem and Bitcoin's associated networks more efficient.  More industry heavyweights have commented on the Taproot Upgrade with Kraken exchange,  it one of the best upgrades with the potential to drive innovations in the Bitcoin Network for years to come.

Xiao Yi, a former advisory member of CCP has been expelled from the party in what appears to be the first full-blown sanction of an official that violated Beijing's stance against cryptocurrency mining.  Per the translated version of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) , the sanctioned official was accused of many crimes ranging from abuse of power to illegal monetary transactions and mining digital currencies without recourse to the environmental damage it may have caused.  [Xiao Yi] violated the new development concept, abused power to introduce and support enterprises to engage in virtual currency mining activities that do not meet the requirements of the national industrial policy, the CCDI report reads.  China implemented its zero-tolerance policy for Bitcoin mining with a  on miners that finally led to the exodus of mining firms from the Asian nation. Beijing's negative stance about crypto miners is fueled by the supposed environmental impact as the majority of the nation's power source comes from coal.  With the Chinese Communist Party's clampdown on mining, party members and especially officials were ethically expected to abstain from Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, making the Xiao Yi offence more grievous.  Xiao Yi seriously violated the party's political discipline, organizational discipline, integrity discipline, work discipline, and life discipline, and constituted a serious job violation and was suspected of taking bribes and abusing power, the report reads.  In addition to expelling Xiao Yi from the party, the disciplinary committee said it has referred the case for additional legal sanctions.  He was expelled from public office by the State Supervision Commission; his qualifications as a representative of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 14th Party Congress of Jiangxi Province were terminated; his income from violations of discipline and law was confiscated; his suspected crimes were transferred to the procuratorial organ for review and prosecution in accordance with the law, the party concluded.  Over the coming months, more related sanctions for offenders of the Bitcoin mining ban may become a trend in no time."

"332",3214,2021-10-20,"Brave New Coin","The Bitcoin mining industry has moved from China to the U.S. What are the implications for the network, and does price follow hash or does hash follow price?   confounding many market observers. The recovery in hashrate has happened in parallel with a major regulatory clampdown on the cryptocurrency industry in China. Once the undisputed global leader in mining power, following a number of threats made by government agencies, Bitcoin’s hash power has been forced out of the country. But despite the sharp plunge in Bitcoin’s hashrate when Chinese miners turned off their machines, the recovery in hashpower has been faster than expected.    Source: BTC.com  Three months ago in mid-July the hashrate of the Bitcoin network was 121.38 exahashes per second (EH/s). Currently, it is up ~21% and sits at 146.53 E/Hs. Since the hashrate of the network capitulated on June 27th and hit a low of 57.47 E/Hs, it is up ~155%. It remains on an upward trajectory and will soon approach its previous all-time-high hashrate of around 200 E/Hs from mid-April 2021.  The rising hashrate has coincided with an even more aggressive surge in the price of BTC over the last 90 days. The price of the Bitcoin network’s underlying asset has risen by ~90%. From a low of US$32,500 in mid-July, to US$64,000 today, Bitcoin is within striking distance of its all-time-high of ~US$64,800 reached in mid-April this year.  This article assesses the impact of the shutdown in Chinese mining, where the new hashrate is coming from, what the future of the Bitcoin hashrate looks like, and the relationship between price and hashrate.  The Chinese Exit  In May, at a meeting of , Liu He, a Deputy Premier, suggested China would soon “crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior” to “resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to society.“ Following his statements, rumors began circulating about a potential exodus of all crypto activity away from China.  There was an immediate impact on the price of BTC, even as industry insiders in China said the concerns were overblown. Popular Chinese blockchain journalist  said the Chinese hashrate had seen no obvious fluctuations and suggested miners were just waiting to see the specific policies of the Chinese government. Beijing-based Venture Capitalist Matthew Graham of Sino Global Capital said Western observers had overreacted to what was a couple of lines in a very long speech.  Before the State Council meeting, the provincial authorities of major mining regions Sichuan, Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia had all introduced policies designed to suffocate mining in their regions. Regulators in the individual regions cited environmental concerns and excessive resource usage as reasons for the bans.  The real exodus appears to have begun on September 15th by the People’s Bank of China, backed by authorities like the Ministry of Public Security and the Supreme People’s Court, to completely stamp out cryptocurrency activity in China. The campaign explicitly warned foreign companies from offering crypto-based services and products to citizens in China, calling them illegal financial activity.  Since the launch of the campaign, at least 20 major crypto companies have announced they will completely cut off any services to mainland China. Binance and Huobi, two of the largest crypto exchanges in the world by trading volume, also stopped allowing any new users with mainland China-based phone numbers or addresses.  SparkPool, one of the largest Ethereum mining farms, announced that it would be stopping all services. Days after a  that it would stop serving all Chinese users. Bitmain, one of the world’s largest producers of cryptocurrency mining machines, on Wechat that it would stop shipping its popular Antminer machine to Mainland China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan).  NBMiner, a company that develops management software for graphics cards, stated that it will no longer be offering tech support for users in China. Tech giant Alibaba Group Holding, announced that it would be banning the sale of cryptocurrency mining equipment on its global wholesale platform Alibaba.com.  The new Bitcoin Hashrate  A popular indicator for the geographical distribution of Bitcoin electricity is the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI), built by the Cambridge University’s Centre for Alternative Finance. Its mining power maps are based on an exclusive sample of geolocational mining facility data collected in partnership with several Bitcoin mining pools.    The most recent geographical hashrate data was by the CBECI on October 13th. It indicates the changing nature of the post-China Bitcoin mining industry. In October 2019, China contributed 75.5% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. By April 2021, this number had fallen to 34%. Today, according to the CBECI, China contributes no hashpower to the network and its data reflects the complete exodus of miners away from Mainland China.  Over the last two years, the hashrate in the United States and Kazakhstan have increased significantly. As of August 2021, the hash power contribution of the United States stood at 35.4% and Kazakhstan at 21.9%.  Other significant contributors include Canada (11.5%), Russia (13.6%), and Malaysia (5.5%).    As well as an East-to-West miner migration, North American mining establishments are increasing their hardware capacities. Riot Blockchain, Marathon, and Argo Blockchain have all announced large investments in Bitmain and MicroBT hardware.  According to an , the company produced 409 BTC, an increase of approximately 346% over its September 2020 production of 91 BTC. Year to date through September 2021, the company produced a total of 2,457 BTC, an increase of approximately 236% from its previous year’s output.  The company says it currently has a deployed fleet of approximately 25,646 miners, with a hash rate capacity of 2.6 EH/s. This equates to ~1.6% of the Bitcoin network hash power.  On October 2nd, following a Twitter Spaces forum, local Kazakhstani mining entrepreneur Didar Bekbau that the country currently contributes 15-20% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate. He also said that miners in Kazakhstan are not allowed to expand due to national grid electricity shortages. For this reason, he would be pivoting to off-grid natural gas.  In the United States, American-focused mining pools have risen to become some of the largest hash power contributors in the world.   estimates that at the start of the year, Foundry USA contributed 0.53% of the Bitcoin network’s hash power. Currently, it contributes 10.98% of the network’s hashrate and is the 4th largest bitcoin pool. , 18.7% in Kentucky, 17.3% is in Georgia, and 14% comes from Texas.    Interestingly, the top two mining pools in the world were founded and based in China until the recent government crackdown. These pools remain operational but are based out of unknown locations now. F2Pool was founded in 2013 and originally known as Discus Fish. Antpool is owned by Bitmain, the largest producer of Bitcoin mining hardware in the world. ViaBTC was founded in 2016 and also operates an exchange and offers mining contracts.  On October 2nd .    Another historically popular, originally China-based mining pool, BTC.com, was purchased by BIT Mining Limited (BTCM) a global mining company based in Hong Kong. BTCM is a publicly listed company on the New York Stock exchange and it appears that the group will move the BTC.com mining pool to the United States.  An 85MW industrial-scale US$12.14 million cryptocurrency mining data center in Ohio with access to a power capacity of up to 85MW is currently being developed by the group. The first phase of the centre's launch is set to begin in mid-October 2021. The group has already launched a smaller capacity data centre (20MW) in Kazakhstan already in operation and it has proposed building another 40MW data centre in the country.  Environmental considerations  The most recent data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) says the . This is about 0.46% of the world’s total energy consumption. It puts Bitcoin mining between the nations of the Philippines and the Netherlands as a global electricity consumer, however, the reality behind Bitcoin’s energy footprint is nuanced. Pure consumption data does not reflect the carbon footprint of bitcoin and the environmental impact.  There are signs, however, that Bitcoin’s hashrate is moving to cleaner energy sources. There is a growing narrative that Bitcoin miners are driving the consumption of renewable energy. The logic is that they will always pick the cheapest sources of energy available. Renewable energy sources are getting progressively cheaper and in many cases are already cheaper than fossil fuel-based energy. This considered, bitcoin miners should therefore encourage the buildout of renewable energy. Bitcoin mining is therefore beneficial for everyone.  This narrative hasn’t always played out, though. One reason it hasn’t is the low capacity factor of wind and solar energy in comparison to fossil fuel-based energy sources like coal and natural gas. Capacity factor measures the reliability of a power source or how often a plant running on that power source is at maximum power. Miners constantly face surging hashrate and intense competition for blocks, so unreliable up-times are not acceptable and thus coal and natural gas are often preferred as power sources for mining.    There are other factors to consider when assessing the carbon footprint of the Bitcoin network. Different mining hardware uses power differently. 5-year-old Bitmain S9 hardware remains extremely popular and represents 30% of the network hash rate activity. These machines are cheaper to deploy and will remain so as long as they are economically viable.  Newer ASICs which require heavier upfront investments are likely to need high uptime power sources to remain profitable. Older machines, however, can remain profitable even with more unreliable power sources. As long as these older, still economical bitcoin mining machines can make their way to power plants using intermittent renewable energy sources they can help wind and solar power find relevance as bitcoin energy sources.  In America, there are reports that miners are using waste fuels like coal gob. They are helping to balance the electric grid in Texas by buying excess energy during periods of abundance and are tapping into the flares at oil-and-gas fields. Bitcoin mining is set to becoming a shock absorber for excess energy in a number of states.  Following major energy shortages in Texas during a winter deep freeze last year, 16 gigawatts of new wind and solar projects are set for construction in West Texas over just the next year.  The new renewable energy capabilities are there to ensure the state has enough power to handle extreme events like ice storms and summer heatwaves. Most years, however, they will produce significantly more power than is required. This is where Bitcoin miners come in. They buy up excess energy when it’s not needed and then shut down their mining rigs when demand surges, releasing power back onto the grid.  Bitcoin miners can use on-the-grid energy when it suits their needs and they are in an ideal position to purchase abundant energy when it becomes available.  The Future Hashrate  The USA, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Canada already appear established as new mining superpowers. Other countries looking to establish themselves as mining powerhouses include El Salvador and Iran.  Three months ago, the former president of Iran, Hasan Rouhani, put a ban on cryptocurrency mining due to the power outage issues the industry caused. On October 4th, the country lifted the ban and allowed miners to redeploy. Before the ban in March 2021, the CBECI estimated that Iran contributed ~7.5% of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate.  Iran has some of the cheapest electricity in the world thanks to the abundance of fossil fuels in the country like natural gas and crude oil. Market observers have suggested that BTC can be a haven of profits for a country that endures numerous trade sanctions from the United States. In May, blockchain data firm Elliptic that Iran would earn US$1 billion annually given its rate of mining at the time.  It appears that this number will rise given the likelihood that Iran will capture some of the hash power lost by China.  El Salvador, a country that is banking its economic future on a Bitcoin-based monetary policy, has an ambitious bitcoin mining strategy.  showing El Salvadoran government branded shipping containers dropping off ASIC mining equipment at an energy plant that appeared to be in the foreground of a volcano.  In June,  was looking to offer facilities for Bitcoin mining that are very cheap. “100% clean, 100% renewable, 0 emissions energy,” he said. The mining will use energy from the country’s volcanos. El Salvador is often called the “land of volcanoes” and geothermal power accounts for about 25% of the country’s energy. Iceland has been using volcanoes for geothermal energy-based mining operations since the beginning of the Bitcoin network.  Does price follow hashrate?  Christopher Bendiksen, Head of Research at digital asset management company CoinShares, believes that Bitcoin is structured in a way that the hash rate follows the price.  In a , An Honest Explanation of Price, Hashrate & Bitcoin Mining Network Dynamics, Bendiksen argues that there is a lag between price increases and increasing hash rates as miners need to order and install new, more efficient mining equipment when the block rewards become more lucrative as the Bitcoin price rises. Bendiksen explains that this is the reason why hash rate increases lag behind the Bitcoin price rise.  Further, he says that hash rate follows the price because miners are paid in Bitcoin while incurring local currency costs. This means that increasing the hash rate during a non-profitable mining environment would not make economic sense for a miner.  It would be illogical to keep mining if it was unprofitable, they will not simply keep mining to provide the community a service. A higher-priced BTC allows more miners to participate, not just ones with economies of scale. This makes the Bitcoin network more competitive (more participants) naturally pushing up the hash rate.  Advocates of the ‘price follows hash’ theory, such as outspoken Bitcoin advocate and media personality, Max Keiser, believe this to be the case. Keiser has claimed on numerous occasions that the Bitcoin price follows the hash rate.  Keiser reiterated this claim following a previous hash rate ATH in a tweet on July 8 2020, , “The constant 10-minute emission schedule of #Bitcoin is the lure that will always attract miners - even acting irrationally - that pushes up hash rate with price following”  For Kaiser, hashrate isn’t just a health metric of the network; it offers wider macro insight and is a measure of adoption and increasing disillusion with the financial system. It appears unlikely, however, that miners would act irrationally or be willing to mine at a loss.    Price vs Hashrate: Since the inception of the network    Price vs Hashrate: Year-to-Date 2021  Since the beginning of 2021, price and hashrate have quite closely followed each other. There was a period in 2019-2020 where price and hashrate appeared to decouple. For an extended period, the price moved sideways and trickled downwards while the hashrate of the network shot up. This suggests that during this period, despite the price of BTC sliding, it was still profitable for miners to keep deploying capital and generating hashrate for the network.  It was likely still economical for large miners to continue mining during that period. The operating cost was less than the profits they were earning from the BTC they were mining, even if the price of the asset was sliding. During this period the price did not rise alongside the hashrate. The rise in hashrate was perhaps creating some positive price pressure on the price of BTC, however, other negatives like fear of regulations and disillusionment from retail investors were stronger and dragged the price down.  This trend eventually changed. Around October 2020 the price of BTC began to surge, at a much faster rate than hashrate. This was again likely more down to other factors like retail speculation gaining momentum, derivatives trading and leverage, and the structure of exchange markets.  During this period price and hashrate shot up together. The already rising hashrate began to rise even more rapidly. New price and hashrate peaks were hit close together in mid April. Following this, both metrics started dropping rapidly between May and July. Hashrate recovered first and then price followed a few weeks later. In this case, the external factors driving down hashrate and price were connected. It was the regulatory clampdown in China.  For a definitive answer on whether the hash rate follows the price or vice-versa, we will likely need to wait another ten years to have a large enough data set to accurately analyze the correlation. What is clear, however, is that there is a relationship between these two metrics that investors need to be aware of and should keep an eye on. For example, if the hash rate is on the rise and the price of Bitcoin is rising alongside it, this could mean that miners are anticipating the rally to continue and are mining coins to take advantage of the higher prices.  Conclusion  The Bitcoin network’s hashrate is resilient. It has recovered a large chunk of the hashrate it lost when Chinese regulators clamped down on mining in the country. For years, China was far and away the dominant location of the Bitcoin mining industry and market observers were skeptical at how quickly the industry would be able to re-settle and deploy to new locations.  Those questions have been answered now. The USA has stepped up to become the largest Bitcoin mining location and hashrate has spread across regions like Eastern Europe, North America, and South-East Asia. Encouragingly, much of this post-China hashrate is set to be cleaner, geared up to be generated through renewables and abundant grid energy.  With the price shooting up thanks to external factors like the approval of a U.S. Bitcoin ETF and the future of hashrate looking secure, Bitcoin looks as healthy as ever."

As many Bhutan citizens are unbanked, the mountainous nation hopes the Digital Ngultrum will foster easier, faster and more affordable payments, both domestically and internationally, helping it reach its goal of increasing financial inclusion by as much as 85% in 2023.  Beyond privacy, the CBDC solution is also custom-designed to handle payments at the volume of transactions required by a successful retail CBDC. This provides central banks like the RMA with the security, control, and flexibility they need to deploy a CBDC without compromising financial stability or monetary policy objectives, Ripple said in the official announcement.  The company noted that the CBDC design will be cost-effective and will enable the RMA to eventually access a network of CBDC ledgers for full settlement interoperability, while still maintaining monetary and technological independence.  Many sovereign nations  their CBDC solutions are employing the expertise of homegrown technologies, as being managed by their respective Central Banks. The choice of Ripple for its CBDC version is ripe as the company's XRP Ledger infrastructure currently powers millions of cross-border transactions and will serve as a sustainable prototype for the 800,000 population in Bhutan.

T he State Committee for National Security said:  More than 500 mining farms illegally connected to power grids have been revealed. It should be noted that the mining farms subsequently lead to a shortage of generated electricity since one set of equipment consumes about 1,500-3,000 kilowatts per hour,  The operation of illegal crypto mining farms is not uncommon in Kyrgyzstan. Back in August last year, Blockchain.News  that authorities uncovered a large illegal mining farm in the territory of Bishkek Free Economic Zone. The mining farm was notably set up there to take advantage of the cheap electricity in the country. Beyond the illegality of these busted crypto mining operations, the activities as a whole have come under fire for their impact on the environment.  This environmental consideration forced Chinese authorities to push out miners, both legal and illegal, out of the country. The eviction notice issued fueled the largest migration of Bitcoin's computing power from China, with miners in search of new hotspots to set up camp. While Kazakhstan, the US, and Canada  the top destinations, countries like Kyrgyzstan with relatively cheap electricity are also not ruled out.  Today, countries or regulators are somewhat torn on how to embrace crypto-mining investments, a move that has pushed miners to begin exploring alternative power sources. For example, the North American mining stakeholders are notably considering the switch to solar energy systems. Should these renewable energy sources become the standard, a new sustainability model will be ushered in, and perhaps, countries like Kyrgyzstan will become more crypto mining friendly."

"339",466,2021-09-03,"Blockchain.News","The president of Belarus, Alexandra Lukashenko, has  his citizens to stay in their home country and start mining Bitcoin instead of working in other overseas countries.  The president said that during the Petrikovsky mining and processing plant opening last week on Friday, August 27.  Lukashenko clarified that his nation enjoys adequate energy resources to deal with those electricity-intensive activities that China has famously banned in May.  ""Create something with electricity. After all, start mining cryptocurrencies or whatever it's called. There is enough electricity in the country."" Lukashenko said.  Lukashenko urged Belarusians to stay in the nation and seek alternative sources of income such as Bitcoin mining instead of moving to Germany or Poland to fill farming job positions. The Belarus president mentioned the already existing locations that Belarusians could use to conduct Bitcoin mining, urging citizens to use the country's abandoned industrial sites to mine cryptocurrency rather than move overseas to look for low-paying jobs.  Lukashenko reiterated that Belarusians are not wanted abroad, saying that foreigners are only waiting for Belarusians to pick strawberries.  ""We must understand; they are not waiting for us anywhere. And if someone is waiting...maybe on the plantations, as Ukrainians often say, the Poles there or the Germans have to squirm, pick strawberries,"" he stated.  Lukashenko, who became president in 1994, has been favouring cryptocurrency mining for a while. Belarus legalised Bitcoin-related business activities, including crypto mining, with Lukashenko approving the decision in 2018. In April 2019, the president suggested using the surplus power produced by the nuclear power plant in the Grodno region for Bitcoin mining.  Lukashenko argued that by using abundant energy that could otherwise go to waste, Belarusians could harness crypto mining and further increase their profit-making opportunities.  Bitcoin's Energy Problem  Lukashenko's remarks come when crypto mining recently faced fierce criticism worldwide for its negative environmental impact.  In May, the Bitcoin price dropped below $30,000 for the first time since January, after surging to an all-time high of almost $65,00 in mid-April.  While Tesla CEO Elon Musk's  were one of the key reasons for such a price dip, China's massive crackdown on cryptocurrencies was another major reason. China's government intensified the  on cryptocurrency mining and trading to prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.  Meanwhile, Bitcoin mining can be a very lucrative business in places with abundant, cheap energy sources. For example, two kids in Texas are making over $30,000 a month with cryptocurrency mining.  Since China issued a countrywide ban on Bitcoin mining, miners are moving overseas, and Belarus might also become a viable option due to its cheap electricity sources."

The Bitcoin Fund will let El Salvadorans convert their Bitcoin assets into the United States Dollar, the country's known legal tender to wade off the impact of the extreme volatility of the cryptocurrency. As detailed by President Nayib Bukele, the fund will aid businesses to accept Bitcoin payments without the fear of price slump or loss.  Per the coverage, the capital for the new fund will be redirected from the country's finance ministry's current budget. It will be administered by the state development bank of El Salvador (BANDESAL).

"341",1683,2021-08-27,"Brave New Coin","Adult-centric platforms that accept cryptocurrency are the clear winners after the OnlyFans debacle once again highlights the power of payment processors to censor and restrain legal business models.  , the popular content subscription platform, has . The U-turn was announced on Wednesday after the company received criticism from content creators after the initial ban was announced earlier in August.  In its initial statement about its proppsed ban on explicit content, the company said that “in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of the platform, and to continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines."" In reality, the move was driven by pressure from the banks - OnlyFans has said that the rationale for making the changes was to “comply with the requests of our banking partners and payout providers.”  On Wednesday, however, OnlyFans announced that it had now “secured the assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and we have therefore suspended the planned October 1 policy change.”  Reaction to the OnlyFans . Some OnlyFans content creators have asked for compensation because of the stress caused by the first announcement. Many content creators had already closed their accounts and were shifting to alternative platforms. In an email to content creators the company wrote, ""OnlyFans is committed to providing a safe and dependable platform for all creators and their fans.""  A tense relationship  However, the relationship between OnlyFans and banking partners still appears tense. The day before the ban decision was made, OnlyFans founder Tim Stokely told the Financial Times that he blamed banks for penalizing the company for supporting sex workers. JPMorgan Chase is particularly aggressive in closing the accounts of sex workers or  any business that supports sex workers,"" Stokely said in a statement.  The decision by OnlyFans to ban sexually explicit content due to a fraught banking relationship is similar to .  The rise of OnlyFans  OnlyFans has a reported 130 million users and more than 2 million content creators. The platform was founded in 2016 by English businessman Tim Stokely. Its popularity exploded at the onset of the Covid pandemic and in May 2020  OnlyFans was ""seeing about 200,000 new users every 24 hours and 7,000 to 8,000 new creators joining every day.""  This signup rate has slowed but the continued growth of the platform is impressive. In July this year, for example, 114,065 new creators joined the platform.    Source: OnlyFans  Unlike sites like Pornhub, OnlyFans was not designed specifically to be a vehicle for delivering adult content, but it has nonetheless become synonymous with the industry. It has disrupted the adult content space by creating an efficient way for performers to connect with fans. It uses a subscription-based model that allows pay-per-view content plus other revenue opportunities such as tips and live streams. OnlyFans found success thanks to a straightforward, easy-to-use user interface, attractive revenue sharing (performers keep 80% of earning), and relevance to the creator economy zeitgeist.  R&B superstar Beyonce mentioning OnlyFans in her remix of the Megan Thee Stallion song ‘Savage’, drove a surge in the platform's usage. Then, when former Disney Star Bella Thorne joined in August 2020, she broke revenue records, earning US$1 million within 24 hours and more than US$2 million in less than a week.  OnlyFans has been a major factor in the destigmatization and normalization of adult content. Even mainstream celebrities have used the platform to share risque content and connect more closely with fans. On top of disrupting the porn industry, OnlyFans has also influenced the content strategy of big-name social media platforms.  In February 2021, Twitter. If a user has 10,000 followers and tweets at least 25 times per month they can sign up for the program. Super Followers is Twitter’s first foray into a membership-based monetization model. Creators will be able to charge Super Followers a monthly fee for exclusive content. It follows a similar revenue model to OnyFans where creators take 97 percent of the revenue, up until they reach $50,000 in lifetime sales. After that, Twitter increases its cut, but creators still keep 80 percent of the revenue.  A victim of its own success  It is still unclear how much OnlyFans brand loyalty is set to be undone because of its tense relationship with banking partners. Exasperating the situation, the rationale behind the policy shift remains unclear. The banking industry remains conservative and it may be that OnlyFans was a victim of its own success.  that OnlyFans has had issues getting investors on board due to its association with pornography.  OnlyFans has also faced examination from regulators because of concerns that illegal content may be hosted on the platform. On the 19th of August, congresswoman Ann Wagner announced that she would lead a bi-partisan coalition . Wagner is the congresswoman that introduced the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) bill. Packaged with the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), this .  Following an investigation, that OnlyFans was ""failing to prevent underage users from selling and appearing in explicit videos"" and they say this was based on reports from police, schools and the UK organization Childline.  The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NMEC) reports less than 100 instances of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) per year over the last three years on OnlyFans. To put this in context, NMEC reported that in 2020, MindGeek-owned companies (Pornhub is an example) accounted for around 13,000 CSAM cases, Twitter accounted for 65,000 and Facebook accounted for 20 million instances, around 95% of total recorded incidents.  , Mike Stabile, communications director for the adult industry organization Free Speech Coalition, criticized the Wagner coalition. ""They claim that OnlyFans is a major marketplace for CSAM, but can't provide any evidence. While all internet platforms are vulnerable to unwittingly hosting CSAM, OnlyFans is incredibly rigorous in its vetting process, certainly more so than mainstream social networks. Ask any of the adult creators on that platform how difficult it is to get content approved."" Before posting anything on OnlyFans, creators have to provide multiple forms of ID, and sign all federally required tax documents.  Creators appear happy to play ball and work towards stamping out CSAM and other illegal content on content subscription platforms. In a quote shared with Brave New Coin, adult actress Brandi Braids, one of the top 0.34% of OnlyFans earners, explained that she “100 percent supports any and all means to eliminate ANY illegal content. That said, 99%+ of adult content creators and adult content is 100% legal and should be protected. We are willing to undergo any verification procedure to ensure the safety of online platforms, as well as our continued ability to provide content and earn income.”  Creators explore Crypto-based alternatives  OnlyFans does not accept payment in cryptocurrency, so when its content ban was announced, creators like Braids began to look towards crypto-based solutions as an alternative to mainstream platforms likely to face pressure from banking partners.  Platforms such as , Cumrocket, and Nafty are emerging to provide crypto-based alternatives to OnlyFans that are less likely to change policy or disenfranchise users. Braids told Brave New Coin “My partner and I have been involved with the Cumrocket team since very early in their project and I am an ambassador for Nafty. We recognize that this attack on our industry from banks and payment processors is likely to continue and that we can avoid this threat in the crypto space.”  Braids, however, reported that very little of her income comes from crypto. Crypto payment systems at present lack broad mainstream adoption, and . Braids told BNC that PornHub’s demonetization and switch to crypto payments meant she lost 80% of the revenue she had previously earned from the platform.    Adult NFTs are part of the FTY ecosystem  Another performer, Lacey London, is ready to make the switch to crypto-only. London told Brave New Coin that she is leaving OnlyFans to create content on Nafty exclusively. London said that almost 70 percent of her income is crypto-based and has been since the beginning of last year. “Every single week I invest,” she explains. “There’s so many advantages to having crypto for adult content creators. The ability to track your profits, fraud prevention using the blockchain, passive income, security against payment processors, the list is endless.”  When asked about how adult content creators can protect themselves from the danger of de-platforming, London had some suggestions. “Always save your content on a separate drive, never direct upload to the site. Start putting money aside to create your own website. That way no one can take you down. Start a decentralized website. Upload on more than one platform.”  Jeff Dillon,  Chief Business Development Officer, told Brave New Coin that sign-ups to the platform have increased dramatically since the first OnlyFans announcement. Nafty operates both an NFT platform () and a fan-content sharing platform (). It functions with its native FTY token and has its own payment organization system called Naftypay that can be integrated into other decentralized applications for the easy swapping of  with other tokens.  Dillion told Brave New Coin that “if the credit card companies decide to restrict Nafty, we have an alternative payment method and a big user base that likes to pay in Nafty tokens.” The FTY token currently trades for ~$0.00261 and is up a staggering ~120474% in the last 30 days."

As the popularity of crypto assets like Bitcoin and Dogecoin continues to rise, several car dealers and manufacturers have identified that as an opportunity to reach and even attract new clients. BOTS will be providing Dogecoin merchant processing services to pre-owned Tesla dealers and individuals first.  The move, therefore, makes Bots one of the first publicly traded companies to accept Dogecoin as a payment method for its services and products.  BOTS Inc. is an international information technology firm specialising in blockchain-based solutions, cryptocurrency, fintech, cybersecurity solutions, insurance, mining equipment repair, consulting, and decentralised finance application solutions. On August 16, the firm said that it has started allowing local dealerships to accept cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin for used Tesla vehicles.  Since the demand for Tesla cars is exceptionally high, some clients would rather purchase a used Tesla car than wait many weeks to deliver a new one. Thus, the dealer customer base continues growing steadily.  Since last year, the global shortage of microchips has caused vehicle manufacturing companies to minimise new production, causing increased prices of used cars. As a result, the prices of some popular models of used cars are higher on second-hand markets than the brand-new cars.  SeeCars Executive Analyst Karl Brauer talked about the development. He said: Buyers are willing to pay extra for a used Tesla Model 3 because the Model 3 is still relatively uncommon in the used car marketplace. And despite the high resale value of its used versions, it is the most affordable Tesla available. It appeals to a wide audience from tech enthusiasts to eco-minded consumers to those who want a fun-to-drive sporty car.

"345",553,2021-08-18,"Blockchain.News","Fitch Ratings Inc has  that El Salvador's move to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender poses a severe risk to its local insurance firms.  On June 9, Nayib Bukele, the President of El Salvador, influenced lawmakers to vote and eventually passed the Bitcoin law. The country will formally adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 9, exempting it from capital gains tax and requiring tax collectors and local businesses to accept the cryptocurrency.  However, Fitch Ratings, a US-based credit rating agency, has announced that El Salvador's decision to embrace Bitcoin as legal tender will likely be a negative credit exchange for local insurance firms with exposure to the crypto due to the earning volatility higher foreign exchange risks.  Fitch further stated that El Salvador's local insurance companies would be under pressure by converting Bitcoin to dollars to avoid price risks quickly. If that is not possible, the insurers could face massive losses if Bitcoin plunges its value, the agency said.  Fitch further warned of additional operational and regulatory risks involving El Salvador's adoption of Bitcoin as a legal tender, mentioning that regulators across the world have not defined the crypto's practical implementation.  Fitch emphasised that such a lack of implementation shows that Bitcoin is not expected to be widely implemented by insurance companies to make claims, benefit payments or provide policies denominated in the digital currency.  The underlying regulations governing Bitcoin's official status remains uncertain, with September's deadline looming. Fitch describes the process as ""unnecessarily rushed,"" adding that the plan ""leaves insurance companies with very little time to adapt.""  Fitch, tasked with providing ratings to global insurance companies, says that Bitcoin is a risky reserve asset, citing the crypto's lack of transparency. The agency further noted that El Salvador's Bitcoin adoption could leave the local insurance industry even more fragile as many insurers already hold large caches of flow-rated Salvadorian government bonds.  In July, Fitch-rated El Salvador's sovereign debt and local insurance industry with a B-rating (negative outlook), i.e. low credit quality securities, mainly sovereign bonds. The agency described the new Bitcoin law as one of the many reasons for maintaining a B-rating, regarded below investment grade. The rating agency stated that the adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender could negatively affect El Salvador's debt relief talks with the IMF (International Monetary Fund), further debasing the country's bonds.  Cryptocurrency as A National Currency  The IMF also warned El Salvador about the risks that come with making Bitcoin legal tender. Last month, the international agency  that elevating Bitcoin into the status of national currency could harm the country's financial integrity, macro-financial stability, consumer protection, and the environment.  The IMF also noted that cryptocurrency could cause price fluctuations, difficulty setting fiscal policy, and negative environmental impacts. The agency also talked about crypto assets that could pose security concerns as cryptocurrency could evade taxes, fund terrorism, and launder ill-gotten money.  However, politicians in many other nations have been eager to follow El Salvador's making cryptocurrency a national currency.

"349",890,2021-07-27,"Blockchain.News","With several blockchains projects competing to get the edge, the big names frequently get the shots. However, small blockchains like Telos still manage to make a name for themselves and even exceed the functionality of the bigger ones in some areas.  It is always important to look beyond the big names because the undervalued blockchains (such as Telos) are known to offer tremendous potential.  Major enterprises and organisations have overlooked the big-name blockchains and are now turning to  to launch and run blockchain applications.  With this in consideration, this article, therefore, aims to explore how Telos the first ESG Blockchain is doing it right.  Socially Responsible Investing  As the global economic landscape continues evolving at a rapid pace, it appears that an increasing number of investors are fast becoming more environmentally conscious. For example, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, recently halted accepting Bitcoin payments for the automaker's various products. Musk cited that reaching such a decision was due to Bitcoin's mining processes being relatively energy-intensive.  In recent times, environmental, social Governance (ESG) investment and business practices have begun to gain widespread attention. Many investors are starting to use ESG as one of the main standards when weighing the potential risks of any business initiative looking to put their finances.  However, ESG reporting has come with certain challenges, which can be addressed by decentralised, transparent blockchain technology. While the calls of the integration of blockchain markets and the ESG have continued rising in the fintech landscape, only a few blockchain solutions have sought to integrate two aspects together, an issue that has made Telos widely known.  Since its inception, Telos, which is  as the best and fastest, virtually fee-less blockchain platform, has been helping to mitigate several environmental problems that have hindered the growth of the blockchain industry.  The energy usage ratio of the Telos blockchain is identified to be significantly lower than several of its blockchain competitors such as Cardano, Ethereum 2.0, Bitcoin, and others. Telos normally undergo regular audits to keep its CO2 generation figures and native energy consumption in check.  Telos the first ESG blockchain provider has been receiving mass adoption by real-world users across the globe because of its environmental and social consciousness.  Cracking Interoperability Problem  Lack of interoperability is a major concern that has been preventing blockchain mass adoption. Interoperability is highly crucial as organisations and enterprises depend on higher levels of interactions and collaborations. No enterprise will want to conduct its payments with a blockchain whose overall infrastructure is not interoperable and secured.  Telos is getting much more attention than other blockchains because of its ability to offer interoperability solutions.  Telos blockchain  transactions on other chains and networks, integrates existing systems with multiple apps, and makes it simpler for developers to switch from one underlying platform to another.  Telos  the creation of dApps and DAOs running on EOSIO and enables developers to create and run Ethereum-compatible smart contracts without any transaction fees.  With Telos EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), people can build and deploy decentralised applications how they were meant to be, with high speeds, no limit on users, and no middlemen.  Telos EVM allows blockchain developers to choose whatever languages and tools they want and create an EVM bytecode they want to deploy on an Ethereum-powered blockchain and drop it to an EOSIO blockchain uninterruptedly. Also, with Telos blockchain, clients using Web 3.0 can shift to a different series of API (Application Program Interface) providers.  Telos' Transledger platform uses blockchain technology to empower its interoperability network, thus enabling transferring different cryptocurrencies between different blockchains.  Scalability Solutions  When people talk about various  in the market, they frequently point at those ecosystems that belong to cryptocurrencies with high market capitalisation. Ethereum, Cardano, Polkadot, and Tezos are popular blockchains because nobody can deny their prominent market capitalisation rankings.  Despite such popularity, Ethereum has shown several scalability problems. Polkadot has still not launched its parachain upgrade to hook individual side-chains into the main blockchain. While Cardano has only recently launched smart contracts, Tezos, which recognises itself with NFTs, DeFi and other tools, most of its projects are still in development.  To achieve efficiency, blockchain technology needs to be scalable, fast, and facilitate mass adoption. Telos, which has been existing since 2018, might be undervalued in that regard.  Compared to other major blockchains, Telos differentiates itself across several segments. The Telos Network is widely known for its ability to process about 5,000 transactions per second, and its average transaction is much faster than other blockchains.  Conclusion  All the functionalities mentioned above have attracted the attention of some big brands. Cisco, Microsoft, Siemens, Taikai, and Zalando are just a few firms using Telos blockchain to develop applications and unlock real-world activities.  Telos combines the best of different ecosystems and successfully adds other benefits on top, and this makes it offer important features that other blockchains do not provide.  While other blockchains appear to focus mainly on cryptocurrency users, Telos seems to tackle real-world problems and scenarios.  With gaps still being seen in major blockchains, alternative ecosystems like Telos offer impressive solutions. Big brands have noticed this and are now turning to Telos to launch and run their applications on the blockchain."

There appears to be a positive trend in the energy usage of bitcoin, he stated.  Meanwhile, Musk mentioned that Tesla will resume accepting Bitcoin payments when renewable energy is at or above 50% and that there is a trend towards increasing that number.  Despite the recent price plunge, he clarified that he has no intentions to sell Bitcoin personally or through Tesla and SpaceX. Furthermore, Musk hinted that the negative interest rates in Europe could compel Tesla to invest more of its balance sheet into Bitcoin.  Musk also asked Dorsey if he would start accepting Bitcoin payments from advertisers on Twitter. Let's do it, Dorsey responded positively.  Bitcoin Extends Rally  Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, is one of the loudest voices in the crypto world. He frequently uses his Twitter account to post about various crypto tokens and often causes wild swings in their values.  Tesla was once  Bitcoin as a payment method in February when the firm bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin.  However, in May, Musk caused turmoil in the crypto sector by  that Tesla would cease accepting bitcoin payments due to the huge amount of energy used to mine the crypto and causing its value to fall.  Since then, China also  down on crypto mining and trading and eventually expelled crypto miners out of the country. New data from Cambridge University indicates that several miners are now migrating to the US, which is now the second-largest hub for the world's crypto miners.  Musk's comments show that he still exerts significant power over crypto markets. The price of Bitcoin plunged below $30,000 on Monday, July 19, after surging to an all-time high of above $63,000 in April. But yesterday, after the billionaire investor revealed more details about Tesla's plan to reopen accepting Bitcoin payments, the price of the flagship cryptocurrency rebounded by 8%, was trading at $32,018 during the intraday."

The CIO at Moskovski Capital, Lex Moskovski, echoed these sentiments. He :  Bitcoin is going to burn bears with a nice short squeeze at some point. Their only bastion of hope is the Fed tapering out.  BTC whales have been buying the fear   to on-chain analyst Will Clemente:  Whales have been buying the fear. They've now added +96,044 BTC to their holdings in the last 3 weeks.  Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) have engulfed the Bitcoin market ever since the leading cryptocurrency plummeted from an all-time high (ATH) price of $64.8k recorded in mid-April. This has been partly caused by  crypto mining crackdown by Chinese authorities and previous Elon Musk  about Bitcoin's environmental effects.  Market analyst Michael van de Poppe believes that all is good as long as Bitcoin sustains above $31k. Therefore, time will tell whether the short-squeeze will be triggered in the BTC market."

Bitcoin ends the week up ~8% while the second and third largest assets on the , Ethereum () and Binance Coin (), both end the week down ~7%.  The price of BTC surged on Sunday after Elon Musk said on Twitter that the Tesla  again if and when there’s “confirmation of reasonable (~50%) clean energy usage by miners with positive future trend.”  Musk’s tweet appeared in a Twitter thread about an  in which Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka accused him of facilitating a Bitcoin pump and dump scheme. Wierzycka said Tesla and Musk bought $1.5 billion in BTC and then ""sold a big part of his exposure at the peak."" In his response tweet Musk says this was inaccurate, and added that Tesla “only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.”  Musk’s assurances that he is willing to back Bitcoin, as long as it is green, pushed the BTC price from around $34,960 at the start of Sunday to as high as $39,050 towards the end of the day. The price pick-up is evidence that the “Elon effect” continues to be a key macro price driver in crypto markets.  In recent months Musk’s bullish or bearish perspectives about crypto have triggered major market moves. In February, he announced that  to its treasury. This sent the price soaring by ~15% to US$44,000. In May, Musk announced that Tesla would be backing away from Bitcoin for environmental reasons. This pulled the price down by almost ~14% and below $50,00 for the first time that month.  The week also began strongly for Bitcoin markets with prices rising following positive sentiment following . Citizens will be able to use Bitcoin for everything from paying taxes, to servicing debt and to purchasing goods and services.

According to the  which has been passed in the Senate, the lawmakers are now looking at halting only mining operations that are reliant on coal-powered sources while the green options will be allowed to thrive.  The earlier bill 6486A was sponsored to stop all Proof-of-Works (PoW) based mining operations for three years to conduct a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). This EIA will now focus on mining firms that use coal or other bad energy per the amendments passed. Additionally, the three-year timeframe has been scrapped as firms seek options to switch their mining energy sources and need a flexible time to achieve this.  The clamour for new energy options for Bitcoin mining operations is taking place on a global scale. Regulators around the world, particularly in China, are seeking to close digital currency mining operations. The challenge is the fact that the majority of China's mining hub uses coal. In compliance with Beijing's environmental regulations, regions like Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang had to their miners.  The amended New York bill has now been passed to the State Assembly for approval. Once the broader lawmakers give their consent, it will then be sent to Governor Andrew Cuomo to sign it into law. The ultimate pursuit per environmental concerns for New York is to tone down greenhouse gas emissions by 85% by 2050, with zero net emissions from key sectors of the economy within that timeframe.  Besides New York and the US at large, Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador is also mulling the plans to  geothermal energy options from its volcanoes for Bitcoin mining operations.

"364",1573,2021-06-11,"Brave New Coin","The crypto markets have dropped significantly since May, down 50% from recent highs. The crash was partly attributed to China’s negative stance on crypto. What’s the truth behind the FUD?  For good or bad, China is the one country that has always had a major influence on the price of Bitcoin. One of the reasons for this is the majority of Bitcoin mining is based in China, and some of the earliest crypto exchanges and trading communities were also based in China. As a result, China’s ever changing stance towards crypto assets has tended to have an exaggerated effect on the already volatile crypto markets.  However, while headlines proclaiming “China bans Bitcoin” or “China cracks down on mining” appear to represent worst case scenarios, the reality is much more nuanced. In fact, as is the case with much of the internal machinations in Chinese business and politics, the real situation is complex, and ever-evolving.  Disrupting normal economic and financial order  First let’s look at what can be verified as true. China does appear to have stepped up what could be perceived as a crackdown on crypto trading and bitcoin mining. Over the weekend, access to several widely followed crypto-related Weibo accounts was , with a message saying each account “violates laws and rules”.  On June 9th, all Chinese search engines such as Baidu and Sogou  key words of the three major Asian crypto exchanges: Binance Huobi and OKEx. The exchanges were also blocked by social media platforms such as Weibo (China's Twitter) and Zhihu (China's quora).  Last month, Beijing authorities said they would ban banks and payment firms from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.  Financial regulators said banks and payment firms were not allowed to offer clients any services involving cryptocurrencies, and warned of the risks linked to crypto trading. In a  regulators said, “Recently, cryptocurrency prices have skyrocketed and plummeted, and speculative trading of cryptocurrency has rebounded, seriously infringing on the safety of people’s property and disrupting the normal economic and financial order.”  Meanwhile, several official Chinese news agencies have published articles highlighting the risks of trading the volatile crypto markets and the many scams that take advantage of naive investors. The state broadcaster CCTV said the crypto markets are lightly regulated, and that crypto is used in the black market, often for money laundering, arms smuggling, gambling and drug dealing.  These are not empty threats. In early June, the Beijing Daily Client  that 170 criminal gangs had been destroyed and more than 1,100 criminal suspects had been arrested. The arrests are based on the illegal use of virtual currency to provide transfer and money laundering services for telecommunications network fraud.  Similarly, Inner Mongolia’s branch of National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the highest economic planning agency in China, issued a detailed  explaining how local authorities can crack down on crypto mining activities in the region. It’s understood that currently, Shihezi, Changji, and Korla in Xinjiang have banned crypto mining activities, with no clear bans in Yili, Aksu, Altay, and Kuitun. It is  whether all of these restrictions will remain in place after the upcoming CCP anniversary this month.  There’s a growing perception across the global blockchain ecosystem that this trend will continue. More actions are expected, including linking illegal crypto activities in China more directly with the country’s criminal law, according to media commentators. Based on Western media reports, you could be forgiven for thinking that Bitcoin is now illegal in China and the Chinese mining industry is winding down with mining hashpower moving to the west. The truth? Well, the truth is harder to find, and much more nuanced.  Contextual knowledge is extremely important  Matthew Graham is the CEO of Sino Global Capital, an investment firm based in Beijing that invests in decentralized technologies that have a strategic connection to the mainland Chinese market. Matthew’s team closely monitors any blockchain and crypto related announcements by Chinese authorities and have a network of sources able to filter the signal from the noise.  on Brave New Coin’s Crypto Conversation podcast, Matthew provided some insightful commentary on the recent developments in China.  One of the key points that Graham made was the idea that from the Chinese state’s point of view, one of their goals is to project party control. Maintaining this semblance of discipline and control, whether it's over the population or capital, or financial markets, is very important.  “It can be a challenge to interpret Chinese policy,” admits Graham. “So we do a lot of triangulating of information from both official and non official sources. It’s important to understand that contextual knowledge is extremely important and you have to understand what the actual Chinese government priorities are. It’s not always about what is stated, but more what is the motivating factor behind those statements. And so for example, the Chinese government is extremely motivated by anything related to fiat on and off ramps.”  “The Chinese government is concerned about overall financial markets, stability, and retail speculation. That's the big picture story, not something specific to crypto”  -- - Sino Capitol’s Matthew Graham  Graham explains that the financial markets will always be closely watched by the Chinese state. He says the renminbi is not a free floating currency and it is subject to very strict currency controls. The control, or at least the appearance of control, over capital markets is “something that is enormously important to the mainland China government.”  From this perspective, it’s easier to understand why the Chinese ruling party is hyper sensitive to crypto-fiat on and off ramps, and the sometimes murky world of Bitcoin mining, which could be used as a means to get money off shore. Any activities that involve money laundering or tax evasion, will also be very sensitive - as they are to any government.  While China's complex relationship with Bitcoin miners is continuing to evolve, an outright ban is not on the cards. Although there has been talk of miners moving out of China due to the uncertainty, Graham says ""it's important to understand that many Chinese miners were already moving some capacity internationally. Some of this due to the seasonal migration due to the rainy season. It's our view that mining will not be outright banned across the country, that seems like a very low probability scenario. It's likely that there will be a crackdown on different types of illegal Bitcoin mining that is siphoning off electricity from the power grid or not , things like that.""    A wind farm in Xinjiang province. China is upping its environmental game.  Another important point, says Graham, is that the Chinese government is extremely sensitive to excessive retail speculation. Many Chinese investors are unsophisticated, and often have a gambling mentality. As a result, multi level marketing (MLM) and Ponzi style crypto schemes have become commonplace in China.  “Because of the false promises and incentive structures of these schemes, they can grow and metastasize very quickly,” Graham says. “That means that a crypto scam can grow very big, very quickly in a specific region of China. When it falls to pieces, as they inevitably do, then all of a sudden that's a potential for unrest, you could have a fairly large amount of upset people in a small geographic region, potentially mobilizing. So the Chinese government is extremely sensitive to these kinds of things. We should keep that in mind as the starting point for trying to interpret what the actual impetus is for their policy pronouncements.”  A key strategic technology pillar  It’s clear that Chinese authorities have a motive to retain tight control over crypto trading by the local population. It’s also clear, however, that China sees blockchain as a key strategic technology pillar critical to the next decade of growth. Graham says China’s leaders are engineering-minded and technologically bold. China sees blockchain very differently from the west and is uniquely positioned to be the first large nation state to deploy a state-issued digital currency or DCEP (Digital Currency / Electronic Payment).  As it prepares to deploy its DCEP, China has a unique opportunity to take even tighter control of its monetary system. It has been conducting a series of trials in different Chinese cities over the past several years.  “It continues to basically be a slow, steady progression,” says Graham. “It's something that has been in the works for years. This has been a long journey and it started with an R and D research process. Now we’re close to having this out in the wild. The full implications are unclear, but we anticipate that the Chinese government will be creative in terms of getting people to use the DCEP and they will have to be as people are used to Alipay and WeChat.”  Finally, Graham says a mistake that Westerners make is that we tend to put ourselves and crypto at the center of the story, but that's not how the Chinese state thinks. ""In actuality,"" says Graham, ""the Chinese government is concerned about overall financial markets, stability, and retail speculation. That's the big picture story, not something specific to crypto."""
"365",2075,2021-06-10,"Brave New Coin","As the cloud of a crypto crackdown in China looms large, the prospect of Chinese miners moving their rigs to renewable energy sources is one potential silver lining.  Understanding the real effects of Bitcoin’s energy consumption, and if it is wasteful, is a complex subject. Why does the Bitcoin network need to use this much electricity? How important is the Bitcoin network to its users? Perhaps most importantly, how much carbon does it actually emit, as opposed to how much electricity it consumes?  The most recent data from the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) says the . This is about 0.52% of the world’s total consumption and puts Bitcoin mining between the nations of the Netherlands and the U.A.E as a global electricity consumer. But the reality behind Bitcoin’s energy footprint is nuanced.    Source:   What is Bitcoin’s value to the world?  The  is a decentralized, secure  for users seeking to send and receive money. Beyond that, Bitcoin is a breakthrough digital technology. It operates free of the control of centralized authorities like banks or governments. A public ledger records all Bitcoin transactions and copies of this ledger are held on servers around the world. Anyone with a computer can set up one of these servers, known as a node.  Consensus on who owns which coins is reached cryptographically across these nodes rather than relying on a central source of trust like a bank. The Bitcoin network relies on its peer-to-peer nature for its operations and cryptography. Bitcoin - and blockchain technology more broadly - has solved the ‘double spend’ problem and enabled the digitization of value. For decades, many industry sectors have been disrupted because they could not effectively address this issue. Music and software, for example, could be copied and the copies were identical replicas with no loss of quality or function.  Obviously, if money could be digitally copied in the same way it would be worthless. Bitcoin’s distributed ledger solves this problem. If an attempt is made to double-spend, the nodes won’t verify the second transaction and integrity of the currency is maintained - automatically and without any involvement from banks or governments. It’s a game-changer.  The relatively cheap and accessible nature of the Bitcoin money transfer process has offered citizens dealing with broken financial systems in politically unstable countries like , , , and , an alternative banking system. It allows such people to be directly paid by a foreign employer for services like software development - and not have to deal with a slow cumbersome currency exchange process or local currency inflation.  Beyond usage in politically chaotic environments, Bitcoin is relied on by many in large economies like Russia, China, and the US, as a tool to escape monetary repression, inflation, or capital controls.  But there is a downside. Securing the information and value stored on the network in a truly decentralized manner, it turns out, takes a great deal of processing power - particularly as Bitcoin grows and achieves scale. As a result of the recent Bitcoin price bull run, for example, the electricity consumption of the network has increased by 138.16% in just the last year.  The Bitcoin mining and electricity equation  So Bitcoin uses a lot of electricity and it always will - for the time being there is no getting around that fact. The reason is that Bitcoin and all other ‘proof-of-work’ cryptocurrencies are produced by ‘mining’ blocks. In very simple terms it works like this - the Bitcoin network produces a constant amount of Bitcoin every 10 minutes (a block). This Bitcoin is produced by banks of powerful computers called miners that solve complex math problems and are rewarded with Bitcoin for doing so - which they then sell into the marketplace to fund their operations.  The number of miners in the sector is measured by  which is essentially a measure of how much computing power is being applied to the network. As more miners enter the sector, more power is applied to mining Bitcoin and the difficulty of the math problems increases to ensure the rate of Bitcoin production is consistent at one block every 10 minutes. It’s a quirk of the network that more miners means greater difficulty and higher energy consumption.  Can Bitcoin go green?  Given the reality of its energy consumption, where does this leave people like occasional Bitcoin evangelists Elon Musk and others, who, while fans of the disruptive potential of Bitcoin, are nonetheless concerned about the asset’s carbon footprint? If it’s a given that the Bitcoin network is going to continue to require large amounts of electricity to power fair, secure decentralization, could its electricity consumption be cleaner?  Nic Carter, the founding partner at venture capital firm Castle Island Ventures,  that Bitcoin miners want to be environmentally friendly. He says that most miners are ‘long Bitcoin’, they hold BTC and use their mining profits to buy more Bitcoin. It is in their best interest to improve the carbon efficiency of the network to prevent Bitcoin from being targeted by government environmental agencies and move it towards being a more sustainable technology.  , published in September 2020, states that around 39% of proof-of-work mining is currently powered by renewable energy. The surveys conducted also found that 76% of miners used renewables as part of their energy mix.  So how does that usage profile break down geographically? Using geo-location data from sources like IP addresses of hashers connecting to the Bitcoin mining pools BTC.com, Poolin, and ViaBTC, the CCAF has mapped where Bitcoin electricity is consumed.    The majority of the hash power generated by the Bitcoin network is produced in China. Source:   According to the CCAF, hashrate in the Asia Pacific region (China included) is powered by a mix of coal and hydroelectric generation. A wider mix of energy sources, with more clean emission sources like wind and nuclear, is used by North American miners.    Coal-powered crypto mining is principally adopted in the Chinese provinces of Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia, and in Kazakhstan, whereas hydroelectric energy is mainly generated in the South-Western regions of China (Sichuan and Yunnan). It has often been claimed that because c oversupply of hydroelectric energy during the rainy season between May and October, that it is not as environmentally unfriendly as it appears.    A wind farm in Xinjiang. China's renewable energy footprint is growing rapidly.  While there is some truth to this argument and miners in Sichuan and Yunnan are using renewable hydroelectric power, the CCAF data shows that most of China’s mining hash power is produced in Xinjiang. The region is a  and thus it is likely that for most of Bitcoin’s existence, the hashrate produced in this region has been generated using coal.    But this narrative is changing as China has begun developing wind farming in Xinjiang. While coal still dominates Chinese energy production it currently only accounts for around 65% of capacity - down from 79% in 2011. In the same time period, China has increased its total renewables (Hydro, Thermal, Solar and Wind) production by 50% and has a goal of being carbon neutral by 2060.  Furthermore, in a surprise move in 2017, the Chinese National Energy Administration canceled production of 103 new coal power plants as renewable capacity increased and it was revealed that many existing coal plants were operating at far below capacity.    Chart by   Bitcoin miners are probably not leaving China  May 2021 was not a good month for Bitcoin. On May 13th Elon Musk  that Tesla will suspend accepting BTC for vehicle purchases. He initially cited the use of fossil fuels during the Bitcoin mining process and its “great cost to the environment” as the reason for the suspension. This is despite Tesla having purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin in February, and Musk previously publicly backing Bitcoin as an emergent payments network and .  A week later at a meeting of China’s Financial Stability and Development Committee of the State Council, Liu He, a Deputy Premier, China would soon “crackdown on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior” to “resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to society.“  While crypto trading and exchange activity have been banned in China since 2017—mining, privately holding cryptocurrency, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading—can still be conducted legally. Was this about to change? Following He’s speech, the bitcoin price slid heavily and rumors began circulating that Chinese miners were cashing out of Bitcoin positions and exiting the crypto ecosystem.  These rumors appear to be unfounded. Popular Chinese blockchain journalist Wu Blockchain the Chinese hashrate has seen no obvious fluctuations and suggests miners are just waiting to see the specific policies of the Chinese government. Beijing-based Venture Capitalist Matthew Graham of Sino Global Capital says Western observers have overreacted to what was just a couple of lines in a very long speech. He says in reality the speech was a pretty standard warning about excess retail speculation in investment markets - something the Chinese government does often.  While there is still confusion as to what Musk’s intentions are in the Bitcoin space, he has been seen to be walking back his comments somewhat - and is instead lending his influence to drive cleaner Bitcoin production.  Speaking recently at the , MicroStrategy CEO and Bitcoin mega bull Michael Saylor announced . Saylor says the “loose” group will be formed with a selection of North American miners and it will work towards publishing transparent mining energy usage data. The mission of the Council will be to address concerns and negative narratives that Bitcoin is not environmentally friendly.  Saylor says Musk and a group of eight North American miners, who are estimated to control about 10% of Bitcoin’s hashrate, have already met to discuss the energy usage of the network. On Twitter, Musk suggested the meeting had a ‘’ outcome.  A potential explanation for why Musk is concerned about the renewable energy consumption of Bitcoin is the . In an effort to reduce industrial carbon emissions, governments around the world have introduced incentives for automakers to develop electric vehicles in return for re-sellable credits.  Tesla, because it only sells electric cars, receives a lot of these and sells them on to other automakers who can’t meet regulatory requirements. This process has become one of the company’s biggest value drivers. It’s a win-win for all involved, but less so for Tesla and its shareholders if the narrative around the company’s massive Bitcoin holdings becomes less ‘green’.  Michael Burry, of Big Short fame, said Tesla’s reliance on a regulatory credits-based profit model is a red flag and he recently took a $534 million short position against the electric carmaker, betting that its shares will fall.  With the carbon emissions of the Bitcoin network coming under increasing scrutiny, Musk may be trying to front-run the rest of the mining industry and establish a cleaner, greener Bitcoin mining sector that could take advantage of a regulatory environment that favours miners that use renewable energy.  At the same time, China is going greener every day - and while it’s true that a carbon-neutral China in 2060 is still a long way off, it’s not when you factor in that at the current rate of production the final Bitcoin will not be mined until the year 2140.  So if Bitcoin production remains in China, its carbon footprint must decrease - what President Xi wants President Xis gets. Alternatively, if the alarmists are right and mining will be outlawed in China, then a greater global dispersion of hashrate will be good for the network in the long run - dispelling the myth that Bitcoin is controlled by China and moving its production to regions of greater environmental transparency and oversight."

In furtherance of this ban, the provincial officials say banks, financial, and payment institutions operating in the region should not directly or indirectly provide services related to virtual currencies. Additionally, virtual currency trading platforms should not offer pricing, trading, or other intermediary services.  China, with its outgrown population, is considered a significant breeding ground for cryptocurrency-related activities. The persistent calls for the ban of Bitcoin (BTC) and other virtual currencies have contributed partly to the poor performance of the global crypto market at this time. Besides the prohibition relating to financial services for stakeholders in the crypto ecosystem, the Chinese government is keen on banning mining activities. This threat has  many miners to put up their hardware machines for sale.  China has constantly threatened to shut down cryptocurrencies as regulators strive to adhere to environmental sustainability measures.

"367",440,2021-06-04,"Blockchain.News","Chris MacManus, an Irish Member of the European Parliament from Sinn F in Midland Northwest, has  45 amendments to the European Union for regulating digital currencies.  MacManus, the Spokesperson on digital finance for the Left in the European Parliament, said his proposals would fundamentally bring consumer protection and financial stability to the new EU rules.  The growth of cryptocurrencies accelerated to new heights over the past year as the coronavirus pandemic with its ensuing plunge in interest rates  retail and institutional investors into the burgeoning ecosystem. The influx of new capitals causes the industry to blossom, albeit the imminent volatility of this crop of digital assets, including Bitcoin (BTC), burst a run that saw the price of the premier cryptocurrency shoot to an all-time high above $64,000.  These volatilities, MacManus argues that can destabilise the financial system.  In recent times, we have seen the volatility of crypto-assets as their value see-saws in the markets. The EU has proposed regulation mainly in response to the planned emergence of so-called stablecoins'- currencies run by Facebook or others linked to the value of the Euro or Dollar or other assets or currencies. These stablecoins are seen as having the potential to be significant enough to pose a threat to financial stability.  EU to Vet Crypto Projects Before Launching  Per the proposal's details, the MEP said it would serve better if crypto projects are vetted beyond just the release of a Whitepaper. The first prominent Whitepaper for a crypto project was the  released by Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2008, in which he detailed the technical intricacies of the cryptocurrency. MacManus said competent authorities need to do more scrutiny of these projects moving forward.  The forty-five amendments I have submitted toughen up the EU Commission's proposals in several targeted ways. Under my proposals, all new and existing crypto-assets will require authorisation by a competent authority' like the Central Bank. Currently, currency founders have to deposit a white paper that outlines the cryptos' purpose and technology, with no scrutiny whatsoever. These white papers, under my amendments, would also require a lot more detail and transparency, he said.  As part of the conditions MacManus laid down for the approval of a project is the environmental impacts through its energy requirements. The MEP is looking to avoid the scenario wherein a cryptocurrency stirs enough concern as Bitcoin that uses more energy than Sweden and Argentina.

"369",1070,2021-06-01,"Blockchain.News","Do you know that bitcoin mining consumes around  terawatt-hours(TWh) a year? And is it likely to fall unless the value of currency collapses? Mining for cryptocurrency consumes a massive amount of power with heavy computers and machines, leaving a destructive impact all over the globe.  Mining is the process that involves transaction verification on the blockchain without relying on a central authority. Mining computers thrive on solving complex problems, and those computations require a massive amount of energy. There is a reward with newly mined coins and transaction fees once bitcoin miners solve this problem.  According to Cambridge University, bitcoin is presently representing 0.59% of the total global energy consumption. Digiconomist estimates that network energy consumption is hitting the figure of 82.026, which is, according to the site, comparable to Chile's energy consumption. Since the beginning of 2020, Bitcoin energy consumption has surged up to  amongst an immense evolution in digital currencies.  Let's have a deep insight into enormous energy consumption and its adverse impact on environmental sustainability.  Massive Electricity Consumption  Cambridge university suggested that bitcoin mining consumes more electricity as compared to the electricity consumption in Argentina. According to online tools, bitcoin electricity energy consumption is more than Argentina, i.e. 121TWh, the United Arab Emirates, the Netherlands, i.e. 108.8 TWh, and presently creeping up to Norway, i.e. 122.20 TWh.  Specialized computers are connected to cryptocurrency networks to mine. Their main job is the verification of transactions that send or receive bitcoins. This process includes solving complex problems, providing an obstacle for the assurance of combating fraudulent activities. Moreover, critics claim that tesla's  to invest a hefty amount in bitcoin. This week, the currency value hit the figure of $48,000, and according to tesla's announcement, it has brought up to $1.5bn bitcoin and plans to accept it as a payment method in the upcoming years.  According to the 3rd global crypto-asset benchmark study, 28% of the total energy consumed by crypto-mining come from renewable resources. People often develop an interconnection with a massive number of miners to the network to gain immense profits. That utilizes an unexpected amount of electricity because computers are more or less continuously working to solve puzzles. It is possible to estimate how much electricity is being consumed at a time by considering energy demand for the bitcoin network and the average electricity price per kilowatt hour ($0.05).  What Bitcoin Mining Experts Have To Say?  Let's have a deep insight into what bitcoin mining experts have to say about the alarming bitcoin mining energy consumption, which is currently progressing by leaps and bounds.  #1 Dan Held  The head of growth at  Kraken, Dan Held, proclaims that the bitcoin network has been unjustifiably aimed by those claiming that bitcoin is taking its energy consumption irrationally.  Dan Held  that:  What it really boils down to when people argue that they don't like bitcoin energy consumption is they don't actually like bitcoin. People who are not in favour of cryptocurrencies anticipate that bitcoin mining energy consumption is wasteful.  Dan Held emphasizes the fact that everything in this world requires energy consumption, and with technological advancements, the amount of energy required to power that technology is facing immense growth in the near future. Almost all the things in our lives consume energy. Claiming that one utilization source of energy is less wasteful than others is absolutely subjective as all utilizations have paid market rates to use that energy.  #2 Thillainathan  Thillainathan told business insiders that more energy consumption is required as the bitcoin network grows and simultaneously the profitability of mining increases. As an operator of mines, he affirms that minors should take environmental enigma under consideration during the mining process as energy consumption can adversely impact. He expects that bitcoin mining is beneficial as bitcoin prices surge in the market, and more miners should consider utilising renewable energy resources with this upcoming revolution.  He  in front of Insider that:  Being a strong believer of bitcoin, it is an efficient way to store wealth but being an infrastructure provider, it is a dire need that we are required to become as environmentally friendly as possible.  Thillainathan stated that the energy utilised during mining is called dirty energy , and unfortunately, the energy is not sustainable in the longer run. He professes that one day the government will crackdown on the utilization of coal plants.  #3 Mason Jappa  The CEO of blockchain solutions, Mason Jappa, who is also working as an operator of some of the largest mining rigs in the United States, affirms that bitcoin miners are financially incentivized for the operation on the cheapest possible electricity, which often concludes that they utilize energy that would have become useless.  Mason Jappa  that,  Bitcoin mining enhances energy efficiency and simultaneously reduces kWh energy rates for the populous through curtailment agreements, ceasing energy consumption during peak hours, aims at renewable energy, improves energy technology, and reduces natural gas flaring.  Jappa claims that US mechanisms are powered by the process which is called gas-flare recapturing . A chunk of gas is flamed out in the air when natural gas is mined. Bitcoin miners prevent that to release into the air and capture that flare for energy utilization.  Environmental Enigma  Environmental impact is thriving in parallel to bitcoin's emergence and prominence. There would be no doubt in saying that crypto mining requires an enormous amount of energy. According to the latest data analysis by Cambridge bitcoin energy consumption (CNBC), this energy consumption might alarm Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.  Yellen said that:  It is the most incompetent method of carrying out transactions, and the amount of energy consumes during the mining process is staggering.  Also, CAGF explained that:  The more machines operate for mining, the more there is a possibility to solve complex problems. However, more operating machines mean more energy consumption which raises the question of miners' cost.  CCAF affirms that they do not have enough data that backs the determination of  carbon footprint. Hence the major concern is growing bitcoin mining energy consumption and the threats that it is imposing to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in the upcoming years. Also, it is a major concern for encountering the climate crisis."

However, the current plans to clamp down on mining activities prove that negotiating Bitcoin and crypto mining impacts is no longer an option.  China is losing its mining dominance  While the clampdown on Chinese miners may offset the healthy activities of Bitcoin and other crypto mining in the short term, the move has been regarded as an unsolicited but necessary shakeup to decentralize mining activities. Other players from other regions need to take advantage of this situation to step up and join the mining game.  The United States is ramping up plans to boost mining activities in the region, albeit more sustainably. This is affirmed by the  between Elon Musk, Michael Saylor, and key Bitcoin miners in North America.  In fact, the underlying problem is the use of dirty energy for Bitcoin mining.

The news regarding the establishment of the Bitcoin mining council recently caused uproar and encountered criticism. Crypto critics were quick to point out that the formation of such a central governing body contravenes the decentralized ethos of Bitcoin and thus consolidates power over the future of the Bitcoin ecosystem.  For example, Marty Bent, co-founder of Great American Mining company, aired his views concerning the mining council.  This move has absolutely nothing to do with green energy or climate. It has everything to do with 'CONTROL'. Bent wrote in his newsletter shortly after the announcement.  However, Saylor refuted to critics, saying that the formation of the Bitcoin mining council aims to ensure the success of a decentralized cryptocurrency, and the source of decentralization is energy consumption.  Saylor said that concerns over the sustainability of energy sourcing had become an existential threat to Bitcoin (BTC). He, therefore, stated that the council wants to defend BTC and manage any concerns, especially from uninformed parties and ensure that people who are hostile to Bitcoin and the crypto industry are not defining baseless narratives, models, and metrics.  Saylor described the council as an organization whose aim is to standardize energy reporting education, grow the marketplace, and pursue industry ESG goals. He stated that the council's first task is to create a protocol that would standardize energy reporting requirements for the miners and act as a benchmark versus other industries, giving institutional investors comfort as they enter the crypto space. He further revealed that the group intends to create industry-wide Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) goals.  Saylor explained that ESG is an investing strategy focused on environmental, social, and governance concerns to promote sustainability in the corporate space.  Decarbonizing Bitcoin  On Monday, May 24, Elon Musk and Michael Saylor  that they hosted a call meeting event with executives of major crypto mining firms in North America, including Marathon Digital Holdings, Galaxy Digital, Argo Blockchain, and others and resolved to promote energy sustainability within the crypto mining space.  The meeting led to the formation of the Bitcoin mining council to accelerate sustainability initiatives, promote transparency of energy consumption worldwide, and encourage miners to use renewable sources.  The council was formed two weeks after Elon Musk  that Tesla halted Bitcoin payments for its motor vehicles sales and services, citing the increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions. In addition, the establishment of the mining council comes a week after Chinese authorities imposed a crackdown on crypto mining and trading activities.

The billionaire said that the Bitcoin network could meet increasing demand if its users adopted the Lightning Network, a payment that makes Bitcoins transactions cheaper and faster.  Bitcoin hashing (aka mining) energy usage is starting to exceed that of medium-sized countries. Almost impossible for small hashers to succeed without those massive economies of scale. For now, Lightning is needed, Musk said on Twitter.  Lightning is a type of software that processes BTC transactions out of the Bitcoin blockchain to lighten the loading on the network. In other words, Lightning enables cheaper and faster transactions by enabling user-generated channels for receiving and sending payments.  Musk, therefore, suggests that lightning would be necessary to offer the required bandwidth.  ""Layer count depends on projected bandwidth compute, both rising rapidly, which means single layer network [e.g. Bitcoin alone] can carry all human transactions in future imo,"" Musk said.  Without this Lightning, currently, it costs an average fee of $13 and takes 14 minutes to move funds across the Bitcoin network.  The Lightning could help to move funds at the cost of about one satoshi (0.00037636 USD), and transactions are almost instant.

The authors of the report estimated the energy usage of the entire Bitcoin network at 113.89 terawatts per hour 99% of which comes from operating mining machines. The estimate comprises node electricity consumption, pool electricity, miner electricity consumption, and miner demand.  As of March 2021, Cambridge's Center for Alternative Finance estimated Bitcoin's energy usage at 120 terawatts per hour.  Based on the calculation of the report, Bitcoin energy consumption is only half of traditional banking. The report estimated that the traditional banking system industry consumes the most energy at 263.72 terawatts per hour, while gold mining consumes about 240.61 terawatts per hour.  The report further identified four major areas of electricity consumption within the traditional banking system with sufficient data, including ATMs, bank branches, card network's data centres, and banking data centres.  The report, on the other hand, also disclosed that Bitcoin's features could enable people to enjoy financial freedom across the globe, stating that the Bitcoin network can benefit from the energy sector by creating perfect use cases for intermittent and excess energy, and the network will only scale further if network adoption warrants it.  However, the report acknowledged that energy consumption is not necessarily bad and said that people would continue looking for new technologies that require more energy that challenges the status quo. While authors noted that Bitcoin is a good example of such technologies, they said that the crypto network's electricity consumption is acceptable for energy use.  Crypto Energy Debate Fact Check  The development and release of the new study come when an ongoing debate about the energy usage of cryptocurrencies continues to rage. Last week, Elon Musk, Tesla CEO,  that the electric car manufacturer stopped vehicle purchases using Bitcoin because of climate change concerns. Bitcoin price dropped by more than 10% after the announcement, while Tesla shares also dipped.  In February, Tesla  that it purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin for its balance sheet. However, the  of Bitcoin (BTC) as a payment approach for its motor vehicle products and their services purchases in March encountered an outcry from some investors and environmentalists.  Market analysts see Tesla's move to halt Bitcoin payment as an attempt to appease investors' concerns who are focused on environmental sustainability and climate change. BTC advocates insist that BTC mining mainly involves renewable energy, despite part of the process of mining by miners reportedly are conducted in the cheapest way in China. Its electricity is generated by coal.  Therefore, the study research published by Galaxy Digital shows the pieces of evidence that the traditional banking system consumes significantly higher amounts of energy than the Bitcoin network."

Amrita Ahuja, the Chief Financial Officer at Square Inc., said that the California-based financial services and digital payment company did have any plans of purchasing more Bitcoin.  We don't have any plans at this point to make further purchases, Ahuja stated.  There's no plans at this point to re-evaluate where we are from a treasury standpoint,"" with regard to cryptos, she further said.  However, the CFO mentioned that there are still lots of other opportunities for Square to learn with Bitcoin and that the firm, was always evaluating possibilities in the space.  Square made Bitcoin purchase of $50 million for its balance sheet in October 2020 and made an additional purchase of $170 million in February this year.  Square released its last quarter earnings that ended March on May 6 and the firm stated that it had lost $20 million on its Bitcoin investment despite its fair value increasing to $472 million based on market prices.  Ahuja mentioned that Bitcoin purchase on its balance sheet amounted to about 5% of its cash on hand.  We're always evaluating and as ever, I think we'd be customer-led. As we see the evolution of the bitcoin product or crypto products in general, I think we'll make further assessments at that point, she said.  However, the CFO said that the company had not changed its stance on Bitcoin and would continue evaluating its Bitcoin investment on an ongoing basis.  Square's first-quarter revenue increased 266% year-on-year in March to $5.06 billion and this was mainly thanks to Bitcoin revenue generated from its Cash App. Square's Cash App brought in $3.51 billion in Bitcoin revenue during the first quarter of 2021, which is 11 times higher than what it generated last year.  Ahuja further remarked on Square's stance regarding Bitcoin, saying that the crypto industry needs innovation in terms of renewable and clean energy.  ""There's a broader supply chain question around how renewables and clean energy become a greater part of the blockchain in general, and a greater part of the overall mining and transaction network...It's the overall fixed footprint of the network that we need to address,"" she added.  People Worry About Bitcoin Energy Usage  Square's change of tone towards Bitcoin comes a few days after Tesla stopped accepting Bitcoin payments for its vehicles, citing the environmental impact of the crypto. On May 12, Tesla electric vehicle manufacturing company  a complete reversal of its initial plans to accept Bitcoin payments for its vehicle products and services. The company cited the digital currency's energy inefficiency as the reasons for stop accepting Bitcoin payments.  However, Elon Musk, Tesla founder and CEO and the big Bitcoin advocate, hinted that the company may not be done with cryptos altogether. The billionaire said that the auto manufacturing giant will still hold on to its Bitcoin investments, which consist of about $1.3 billion worth of Bitcoin.  Tesla and Square are not the only ones concerned with the environmental impact of Bitcoin.  In February this year, Janet Yellen, The US treasury secretary,  that Bitcoin uses a staggering amount of power and is extremely inefficient for making transactions.  It is complicated to understand whether Bitcoin really harms the environment. But Bitcoin critics have long been wary of its impact on the environment. According to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index, Bitcoin uses more energy than certain countries, such as Malaysia and Sweden."

The company's announcement comes at a time when Tesla automaker and Square payment company announced that they will not make future Bitcoin purchases, citing environmental concerns associated with crypto mining.  Greenidge has said it will buy voluntary carbon offsets from a selection of U.S greenhouse gas reduction projects. The company mentioned that each project has been reviewed and credited by one of three well-known Offset Project Registries, Verra, the Climate Action Reserve (CAR), and the American Carbon Registry (ACR), ensuring that any project funded by Greenidge minimizes emission or increases sequestration of greenhouse gas in a manner that is verifiable, real, and permanent.  Apart from offsetting 100% of its carbon emissions from its Bitcoin mining, Greenidge also plans to invest in a portion of its mining profits in renewable energy projects. The firm is actively considering direct financing of alternative green energy sources in New York and other locations across the country.  Greenidge also stated that it will continue participating in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a market-based program in which participating states sell CO2 allowance through auctions and invest profits in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and other consumer benefits programs to generate local green jobs and encourage innovation in the clean energy economy. According to the report, the company buys RGGI allowances every year to cover 100% of its CO2 emitted from power generation and it has been doing so since it started gas-fired operations in 2017.  Bitcoin Mining Worries Many  As institutional and retail investors continue adopting Bitcoin, one concern that has emerged is its connection to energy and environmental issues. Experts argue that the crypto strains the environment because of all the energy it takes to mine a single Bitcoin. The amount of electricity used daily to mine Bitcoin has been identified to be more than electricity used by entire countries such as Ireland.  Some Tesla investors and environmentalists have been increasingly critical about the manner in which Bitcoin is mined using huge amounts of electricity generated from fossil fuels.  On Wednesday, May 12, Bitcoin's price dropped by 10% after Elon Musk  that Tesla has suspended the use of cryptocurrency as a payment method, less than two months after the electric vehicle manufacturer started accepting Bitcoin for payment. Musk cited the energy concern, especially the use of coal, which has the worst emissions of any fuel.  Earlier this month, a bill was  in the New York State Senate to stop Bitcoin mining until the state assesses its impacts on the environment."

Currently, the cryptocurrency is trading at $43,307.17, down 10% in the last 24 hours.  Last week, Musk announced via Twitter that Tesla was no longer going to enable Bitcoin payments, as BTC was not environmentally friendly enough for Tesla. He hinted that the company was however not done with the cryptocurrency altogether, as it will undoubtedly reimplement Bitcoin transactions once more sustainable energy was used to mine the cryptocurrency. The tweet shared by Musk :  Tesla will not be selling any Bitcoin and we intend to use it for transactions as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy. We are also looking at other cryptocurrencies that use 1% of Bitcoin's energy/transaction.  Musk indicated that Bitcoin's energy usage over the last few months has been ""insane"" to say the least, and further hinted that Tesla may be contemplating Dogecoin (Doge) payments, as it was revealed that Tesla and Doge's developers were collaborating to try to improve system transaction efficiency.  Bitcoin, although touted as the digital gold and the best asset to hold in the crypto market, has not been known to be environmentally friendly. In fact, previous research has revealed that the amount of electricity required to mine Bitcoin daily is equivalent to the electricity needed to power an entire country, namely Ireland. Bitcoin's energy consumption even exceeds the amount of electricity used in certain countries, like Malaysia and Sweden.  XRP is touted as the green cryptocurrency  If Tesla was exploring more environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies as Musk suggested, its search may lead it to Ripple (XRP). XRP has been touted as the green cryptocurrency. According to Ripple's Chief Technology Officer David Schwartz, Bitcoin is 57,000 times less eco-friendly than XRP. One of XRP's driving points is that it was designed with sustainability in mind.  Previously, a Ripple blog post  the energy consumption between 1 million XRP transactions and 1 million Bitcoin transactions. Ripple researchers found that while 1 million XRP transactions could power 79,000 lightbulb hours, 1 million Bitcoin transactions could power a total of 4.51 billion lightbulb hours.  Musk's Bitcoin tweet triggers a reaction  Although Musk's tweet about Bitcoin's energy consumption has not directly  users towards XRP, it has certainly served to spark a conversation about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies' ecological footprint. Following his comments, Greenidge, the world's first fully compliant powerplant-cryptocurrency mining hybrid, came forward and announced its intention to offset all greenhouse gas emissions from its Bitcoin mining facility.

If it wants to regain a rising momentum, today's decisive closing price needs to maintain above 100-day Exponential Moving Average (100-EMA) of around $51K.  The current Bitcoin price has been operating well below the Exponential Moving Average ribbon. Both the downward sloping moving average and the MACD index, which made a bearish crossover below the zero axes, indicate that the bears are currently dominating the market.  Stochastic RSI is below the median number of 50, which is the bearish side of the oscillator. If a large number of sell orders are triggered, BTC/USDT will then test the 200 day-Exponential Moving Average of $42,000 support level.  For long-term investors, the 200-day moving average is usually a critical trading indicator. If the price falls below the 200-day moving average, it is regarded as a bear market signal. Conversely, when the price breaks above the 200-day moving average, it is regarded as a bullish market signal.  It is worth noting that since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, which began around May 2020 for most countries, the price of Bitcoin has never touched the 200-day Exponential Moving Average."

The assessment would establish a report, that would then be accompanied by a 120-day public comment period and at least one public hearing.  The bill mentioned that several mining centers in New York state are located in retired or converted fossil-fuel power stations, including dormant peaker plants.  If the assessment identified crypto mining centers as harmful, then they would be earmarked as things that derail the progress of the state towards meeting its emission targets highlighted in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act Of 2019. Therefore, such centers would not get the necessary permits to conduct their business operations.  If the senate passes the bill, then this would adversely affect a growing industry, particularly in upstate New York where the power for cryptocurrency mining is more affordable and assisted by cooler weather that keeps equipment from lots of overeating.  Greenidge Generation Holdings is one of the leading Bitcoin mining centers operating in upstate New York. The plant, which is based on Dresden, New York, can mine an average of 5.5 Bitcoin daily. In the past, the facility was a coal-fired power plant, but was transformed into a natural gas plant in 2017 and then converted into a Bitcoin mining center in January 2020.  Bitcoin Raises Climate Concerns  Bitcoin mining is a process of solving complex math problems (a complex series of algorithms) in order to create new Bitcoins. Miners are rewarded in Bitcoins. However, the process demands energy intensive consumption. The more Bitcoin that is mined, the more difficulty the algorithms that must be solved to get a Bitcoin.  Today, more than 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined. An average computer nowadays can no longer mine Bitcoin. Instead, mining requires special computer equipment that can handle intense processing power needed to get Bitcoin. Such special computers require a lot of electricity to run.  Bitcoin mining has long been  because of its energy use and environmental impact.  The amount of electricity used daily to mine Bitcoin has been identified to be more than electricity used by entire nations like Ireland. However, several Bitcoin proponents maintain that mining is increasingly being conducted using electricity from renewable energy sources.  Environmentalists claim that mining is still a major concern because miners go wherever there is cheap electricity and that may mean places that use coal. China is the country with the greatest Bitcoin mining activities in the world. The nation has been slowly moving towards renewable energy, an estimate of two-thirds of its electricity originates from coal."

While many industry leaders have increasingly resorted to a proof-of-stake model, which offers better energy efficiency and scalability, some still run on the conventional proof-of-work model, the underlying consensus mechanism behind Bitcoin.  Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen addressed this and said that it might be problematic, especially with the way in which Bitcoin has been appreciating and gaining popularity. A switch to a proof-of-stake model or a Federated Consensus would be an essential move for Bitcoin if it wishes to remain the world's dominant cryptocurrency, said Larsen.  In a blog post on Medium, he wrote:  While many newer cryptocurrencies are already low consumers of energy or even carbon-neutral, Early protocols such as Bitcoin use a core technology called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions, which is not only a huge and growing source of CO2 emissions but also uses massive amounts of energy, both from fossil fuels and green' sources.  Larsen goes on to remind the crypto community that Bitcoin has significantly grown since its inception in 2009. Currently, according to the Ripple co-founder's research, Bitcoin alone  an average of 132 TWh a year, which is equivalent to roughly 12 million US homes' energy consumption. Annually, it releases an estimated 63 million tons of CO2, and of coins running on a proof-of-stake protocol, Bitcoin accounts for 98% of the hashrate.  Meanwhile, in a bid to achieve crypto sustainability, Ripple follows a federated consensus model to validate its transactions and conduct cross-border payments with XRP.  Recently, the fintech firm has also joined the Crypto Climate Accord, an initiative comprised of crypto industry figures such as ConsenSys and CoinShares, to further the conversation on how to develop solutions that enhance sustainability and scalability in the crypto sector, all the while creating value.  According to a  Ripple blog post, XRP was designed with sustainability in mind, and the fintech firm asserts that the cryptocurrency is inherently green. Unlike Bitcoin, where there is a maximum supply to be mined, all XRP is already in existence, meaning no additional mining processes - which require energy consumption - will be needed to produce more."

Most people who've heard of Bitcoin are aware of its notorious volatility, and in some cases, of negative headlines associated with cryptocurrencies, such as the risk of hacks and losing private keys.  Even for those willing to look past the front-page risks, there's a whole heap of jargon and insider knowledge that comes with being a cryptocurrency user, not to mention all the technicalities of blockchain technology. Even at this point in 2020, when the user experience is starting to improve, these barriers are still very real and off-putting to the extent that mainstream adoption remains some way off.   is one example of a blockchain-based application that removes many of the hurdles to cryptocurrency adoption. It combines a fun, augmented reality smartphone game akin to Pok mon Go with an advertising platform that can be used by local businesses to attract people to shop with them.  It makes it easy to accumulate cryptocurrencies without navigating all the complexity of exchanges and fiat onboarding. And it incentivizes users to get out and about, exercising in the fresh air.  What is Triffic?  It's an augmented reality game that users navigate using a map interface. Users can earn Triffic's GPS tokens simply by walking around with the app's location services enabled. They simply need to watch a short ad video to top up with fuel, and the tokens start accumulating once they start moving.  If you've heard of geocaching or Pok mon Go, then you'll be familiar with the concept behind Triffic's Beacons. Within the game's map interface, Beacons show up in certain locations, and users can earn even more GPS tokens by finding them. Beacons come in multiple types, including gold, silver, and bronze, which contain various quantities of GPS tokens. Users can also increase their GPS earnings by increasing their usage of the Triffic app. There are also several ways people can spend their GPS tokens. For instance, Donation Beacons allow the user to make a donation to a particular cause. Triffic used this feature to  in 2020.  Because Triffic uses the phone's location services, it allows local businesses to take advantage of location-specific advertising and promotional services. So if a user is beacon-hunting in a particular neighborhood, they might see an advert for a local coffee shop. Businesses can even create their own branded Reward Beacon.  So using the coffee shop example, the shop owners could place a Reward Beacon in a nearby location offering a free pastry with each takeout coffee. They can also offer GPS tokens as reward points and have the option to accept them as payment or part-payment for goods and services in-store.  Benefits for Businesses and Users  Triffic appears to have hit upon a win-win model for businesses and users. The AR game taps into the vast global appetite for mobile gaming, which market analysts  estimates is currently worth over $70 billion each year. However, unlike most games, users can be rewarded in GPS tokens that have a real-world value. It also overcomes many of the barriers for new users wanting to get into cryptocurrency by providing a fun way to accumulate tokens without needing to use a cryptocurrency exchange. Users who want to up their exercise can also use Triffic as a motivational tool.  It also creates a highly targeted way for local businesses to gain access to potential customers with offers and rewards that isn't available via any other platform. A company could pay for Facebook advertising, but Facebook simply serves up the ad based on the duration and frequency paid for by the business. With Triffic, a business can place a Partner Beacon within a minute or two of their actual location, knowing that customers are in the vicinity when they see it.  What is Triffic's Business Model?  Of course, Triffic has to be able to monetize the platform itself to fund future development and ongoing operation. Therefore, the app makes revenues from its own GPS tokens. These come from three channels from a share of advertising revenues, from in-app subscriptions for account upgrades, and from a share of revenues from Partner Beacons.  Triffic is developed on the Ignis blockchain, the main child chain of the Ardor blockchain. Ignis offers out-of-the-box features that allowed the team behind Triffic to get up and running with a blockchain-based application without having to develop their own platform. Triffic plans to migrate to its own dedicated Ardor child chain in 2021 as part of its expansion plans, which include extending GPS rewards to ridesharing and food delivery apps.  However, it's currently one of three promising projects developed on Ignis. Treecoin is another a sustainability initiative aiming to reforest parts of Paraguay with timber yielding eucalyptus trees. The third is Bridge Champ, an online gaming platform for players of the popular strategy card game, contract bridge.  All three projects are supported by Jelurida, the firm that operates the Ardor ecosystem. Jelurida has a long pedigree in the blockchain development sector, having been part of the team that developed Nxt in 2013, the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain.  Triffic will announce more about its expansion plans over the coming year."

Ripple had considered relocation to Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the United Arab Emirates, as it had  that those countries had a better crypto framework around digital assets. This year, in early November, Ripple has announced its decision to establish a regional office in Dubai, but its official headquarters are still currently situated in San Francisco, US.  Christmas lawsuit  For most of 2020, XRP sustained its capital as the third-largest cryptocurrency on the market. However, it has shot down and lost a huge chunk of its market value due to it all year round,  Although Ripple has proudly birthed XRP, it has also rectified and declared over the years that Ripple and XRP operate independently. XRP token was first created in 2004 by web developer Ryan Fugger. XRP operations have been handled on an open-source network XRP Ledger, which runs on top of the digital payment platform RippleNet. XRP has been leveraged as an affordable bridge currency between different types of payment, be it fiat-to-fiat, or fiat-to-cryptocurrency.  Now, the distinction between Ripple and XRP operations matters more than ever, as the SEC has decided to wrap up the year with a final sting. On December 22, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs Inc. and two of its executives, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen. The lawsuit concerns XRP and alleges that Ripple had raised over $1.3 billion in funds through the sale of digital assets XRP- in an unregistered securities offering to investors in the US and worldwide. The years of cryptocurrency debate over whether XRP should be classified as a security has culminated into a brutal lawsuit that Garlinghouse is determined to fight.  XRP is sanctioned, but not Bitcoin or Ethereum  The SEC's plan to sue Ripple for the sale of unregistered securities has caused XRP to plummet on the market, as the currency has lost over $10 billion in market cap, with investors dumping it. The lawsuit alone had reversed all the monumental gains XRP acquired in November, where the currency rose to a two-year high, and achieved 136% in just a single month. XRP, unlike its counterpart Bitcoin and Ethereum, has failed to gain the status of a commodity under SEC regulations.  XRP suffers, but Ripple is determined to win  CEO of Ripple, Brad Garlinghouse, is determined to fight this. He said that the US has been the only G20 member to rule XRP as a security and is confident that Ripple can fight this lawsuit. He said:  Chris and I had the option to settle separately. We could do that, and it would all be behind us. NOT happening. That's how confident Chris and I are that we are right. We will aggressively fight and prove our case- through this case we will get clear rules of the road for the industry here in the US.  This turn of events has left the future of Ripple uncertain, and the crypto realm will not likely see XRP regain in strength anytime soon, as the cryptocurrency continues sinking. However, the lawsuit's verdict will significantly impact the crypto industry, and will serve to clarify digital asset regulations in the US."
"411",919,2020-12-23,"Blockchain.News","Entering the world of cryptocurrency can be a daunting prospect for newcomers, with several practical and psychological barriers to overcome. Most people who've heard of Bitcoin are aware of its notorious volatility, and in some cases, of negative headlines associated with cryptocurrencies, such as the risk of hacks and losing private keys.  Even for those willing to look past the front-page risks, there's a whole heap of jargon and insider knowledge that comes with being a cryptocurrency user, not to mention all the technicalities of blockchain technology. Even at this point in 2020, when the user experience is starting to improve, these barriers are still very real and off-putting to the extent that mainstream adoption remains some way off.   is one example of a blockchain-based application that removes many of the hurdles to cryptocurrency adoption. It combines a fun, augmented reality smartphone game akin to Pok mon Go with an advertising platform that can be used by local businesses to attract people to shop with them.  It makes it easy to accumulate cryptocurrencies without navigating all the complexity of exchanges and fiat onboarding. And it incentivizes users to get out and about, exercising in the fresh air.  What is Triffic?  It's an augmented reality game that users navigate using a map interface. Users can earn Triffic's GPS tokens simply by walking around with the app's location services enabled. They simply need to watch a short ad video to top up with fuel, and the tokens start accumulating once they start moving.  If you've heard of geocaching or Pok mon Go, then you'll be familiar with the concept behind Triffic's Beacons. Within the game's map interface, Beacons show up in certain locations, and users can earn even more GPS tokens by finding them. Beacons come in multiple types, including gold, silver, and bronze, which contain various quantities of GPS tokens. Users can also increase their GPS earnings by increasing their usage of the Triffic app. There are also several ways people can spend their GPS tokens. For instance, Donation Beacons allow the user to make a donation to a particular cause. Triffic used this feature to  in 2020.  Because Triffic uses the phone's location services, it allows local businesses to take advantage of location-specific advertising and promotional services. So if a user is beacon-hunting in a particular neighborhood, they might see an advert for a local coffee shop. Businesses can even create their own branded Reward Beacon.  So using the coffee shop example, the shop owners could place a Reward Beacon in a nearby location offering a free pastry with each takeout coffee. They can also offer GPS tokens as reward points and have the option to accept them as payment or part-payment for goods and services in-store.  Benefits for Businesses and Users  Triffic appears to have hit upon a win-win model for businesses and users. The AR game taps into the vast global appetite for mobile gaming, which market analysts  estimates is currently worth over $70 billion each year. However, unlike most games, users can be rewarded in GPS tokens that have a real-world value. It also overcomes many of the barriers for new users wanting to get into cryptocurrency by providing a fun way to accumulate tokens without needing to use a cryptocurrency exchange. Users who want to up their exercise can also use Triffic as a motivational tool.  It also creates a highly targeted way for local businesses to gain access to potential customers with offers and rewards that isn't available via any other platform. A company could pay for Facebook advertising, but Facebook simply serves up the ad based on the duration and frequency paid for by the business. With Triffic, a business can place a Partner Beacon within a minute or two of their actual location, knowing that customers are in the vicinity when they see it.  What is Triffic's Business Model?  Of course, Triffic has to be able to monetize the platform itself to fund future development and ongoing operation. Therefore, the app makes revenues from its own GPS tokens. These come from three channels from a share of advertising revenues, from in-app subscriptions for account upgrades, and from a share of revenues from Partner Beacons.  Triffic is developed on the Ignis blockchain, the main child chain of the Ardor blockchain. Ignis offers out-of-the-box features that allowed the team behind Triffic to get up and running with a blockchain-based application without having to develop their own platform. Triffic plans to migrate to its own dedicated Ardor child chain in 2021 as part of its expansion plans, which include extending GPS rewards to ridesharing and food delivery apps.  However, it's currently one of three promising projects developed on Ignis. Treecoin is another a sustainability initiative aiming to reforest parts of Paraguay with timber yielding eucalyptus trees. The third is Bridge Champ, an online gaming platform for players of the popular strategy card game, contract bridge.  All three projects are supported by Jelurida, the firm that operates the Ardor ecosystem. Jelurida has a long pedigree in the blockchain development sector, having been part of the team that developed Nxt in 2013, the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain.  Triffic will announce more about its expansion plans over the coming year."

Prof. Eric Yim, Chairman of Hong Kong Design Centre , said, Through Business of Design Week, we are committed to promoting the power of innovative design in Hong Kong, and across the world. At this year's BODW Summit, over 100 influential design and business leaders gathered together and explored some of the critical topics that will redefine the pandemic era, and inspire us to imagine new possibilities for the future.  Here are some thought-provoking insights from this year's BODW speakers, grouped by themes explored during the Summit:  Creative Leadership What is Next For Design Now, Near and Far  Tim Brown (US), Chair of IDEO , said, Organisations with existing design capacity were able to respond more quickly (to the pandemic). This shows that investing in design makes society more resilient to unexpected shocks.  Brand Futures TOMorrow: Designer Brands after 2020  Tom Dixon OBE (UK), Designer Creative Director of Tom Dixon , said The combination of the digital, handmade and personal will be the interesting evolution in terms of design thinking.  Entwined Spaces Melting the Boundary: Live/Work  Keith Griffiths (Hong Kong), Chairman Global Design Principal of Aedas , said, So if everybody's buying products online, what is the purpose of shopping (at physical shops)? What's the purpose of a (physical) shop? We as human beings need to socialise. These palaces of purchasing called shopping malls will no longer be places where we just buy products. They'll be places where we go to meet to exchange news.  Safe Travels Designing Tomorrow's Travel Experience  Paul Priestman (UK), Designer, Co-founder Chairman of PriestmanGoode , said, The contactless journey is a key part of transport design thinking - how do we ease the customer journey in travel, removing the stopping points. Key to design of big airports and stations is to help make the journey secure, safe but also enjoyable.  Circular Economy Circular Magic in Nature, People and Planet  Lay Koon Tan (UK), Co-founder of Nature Squared said, Today's environmental imperatives are global poverty and inequality. All these issues are very widely publicised. We felt strongly that if we want to make a difference, however small, we can contribute to sustainable development. We needed to come up with an answer that was holistic and would address environmental, social and financial responsibilities.  Immersive Tech Design x Art x Tech: Stroke of Human Touch  Victor Wong (Hong Kong), Founder of vfxNova said, For me, the work of AI is not just to mimic the work of humans. I think we should find a way to cooperate with AI to do something that humans cannot do. So the process inspires us to do the next.

The proof of concept will be pivotal in the technical feasibility of the project.  Accelerating supply chain visibility  By collaborating with seven global companies in the blockchain-enabled proof of concept initiative, the World Economic Forum (WEF) intends to boost industrial solutions for ESG requirements and supply chain visibility.  According to the :  The successful completion of the proof of concept, named the COT, a Carbon Tracing Platform, will be critical in helping to ensure traceability of emissions from mine to the final product. With a focus on end-to-end traceability, the COT platform uses distributed ledger technology to track CO2 emissions.  The conception of this project started in October 2019 after founding members, such as Tata Steel, Anglo American, and Eurasian Resources Group joined forces in designing and exploring blockchain solutions needed in accelerating responsible sourcing in the mining sector.  Addressing supply chain complexities  The WEF acknowledged that the blockchain project not only tested the technological feasibility of the solutions but also explored the complexities of the supply chain dynamics. As a result, the proof of concept will be instrumental in responding to stakeholders' demands to generate mine to market accountability and visibility.  J rgen Sandstr m, the head of WEF's mining and metals industry, noted:  There is an increasing demand for metals and minerals, and an increasing demand for sustainable and responsible and traceable supply chains.  He added:  There is a potential to create a full value chain view with downstream visibility, and in partnering with regulators and aligning our work with robust ESG standards, sustainability certification schemes, and assurance frameworks.  In October, The WEF  blockchain standards dubbed the Global Standards Mapping Initiative (GSMI) gathered from 185 jurisdictions, 30 technical standard-setting entities, and almost 400 industry groups aimed at being a resource to thrust the blockchain sector forward."

The cooperation between a high-tech team backed by Wozniak and a leading team from the blockchain industry has shown us an ambition that may end up a revolution in the environment and energy industries.  After success with Apple, Wozniak was attracted to the technology of blockchain and use of cryptocurrencies. As a believer in blockchain industry and cryptocurrency economics, Wozniak and other industry veterans founded the energy-efficiency company Efforce.  Efforce is a blockchain-based energy saving platform which provides an innovative way for companies to fund energy-efficient projects and save energy expenses. Launching a token named WOZX, Efforce allows contributors to fund energy efficiency projects by investing in WOZX and be repaid in tokens representing the energy savings achieved.  The energy efficiency market has always been too complex for retail investors. However, with the innovative business model launched by Efforce, anyone interested in energy projects can easily access the market, while companies who wish to implement solutions will be able to negotiate directly with consumers or contributors in the open market. Tokenization will play an important role in this process. With the issuance of WOZX, a contractual relationship between contributors and companies seeking funds for energy projects is formed, allowing contributors to participate directly in the savings generated through the projects.  Wozniak stated in a   ""We created Efforce to be the first decentralized platform that allows everyone to participate and benefit financially from worldwide energy efficiency projects, and create meaningful environmental change.""  The goal is to decentralize the $241 billion energy financing market, much as Apple aimed at in popularizing personal computing. The most important part of Efforce's project, the WOZX, has been carefully designed and issued. The Wozniak team chose HBTC.com to first launch the WOZX.  Wozniak's Adventures in Crypto  While Wozniak has always been a Bitcoin believer and managed to buy in when the BTC price was at around $700 per coin. As he  to CNBC, the Apple co-founder, unfortunately, sold most of his stash at the end of the bull run of 2017 and 2018 he now holds only one Bitcoin.  At the time of the CNBC interview in 2018, Wozniak said he saw his Bitcoin investment as more of an experiment than anything but remarked on the natural evolution of Bitcoin. He said:  Bitcoin is mathematically defined, there is a certain quantity of Bitcoin, there's a way it's distributed and it's pure and there's no human running, there's no company running and it's just growing and growing and surviving.  The Apple co-founder's WOZX token was launched on December 3 on HBTC, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Like Bitcoin, WOZX has a limited supply but a much larger one of 1 billion tokens. The token's initial price was 0.1 dollars at the time of launch and reached 1.41 dollars per token and within just five days, the crypto's price increasing in value by 1,400%.

The crypto exchange announced the launch of its Ethereum 2.0 staking service via its platform just four days ago. The service enables Kraken customers to verify ETH 2.0 blockchain network in return for token rewards.  Just four days into the staking service, Kraken has already achieved a record-high of more than 100,000 Ether (ETH) for the purpose of staking on ETH 2.0, an amount which equates to over $60 million. Kraken's Product vice president, Jeremy Welch, proudly applauded this, as the deposited amount via the exchange constitutes 8% of all Ether staked on Ethereum 2.0. He said:  Kraken has long been a supporter of Ethereum. In fact, we were one of the first exchanges to list Ether in August 2015. We have watched as Ethereum has continued to grow in significance.  Kraken is not been the only one to have embraced Ethereum's new blockchain upgrade. Binance and Huobi have also recently joined the Ethereum network, launching their ETH 2 staking service last week.

Slashing on PoS Ethereum 2.0 - what this means  On Ethereum 2.0 mainnet, efficiency, scalability, and sustainability are expected to be achieved. However, the downside of Ethereum 2.0 may be that the penalty of underperforming as a validator on the transitionary proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol is that it may result in slashing.  Slashing entails just what the word means- it is designed to slash or cut a given validator's ETH stake, if the latter misbehaves, such as going offline for too long or by making configuration errors.  While slashing may be a harsh punishment for validators, gradually cutting a validator's stake until the latter is expulsed of the Ethereum network, the purpose of it is also to discourage attackers looking to hack the blockchain ecosystem or to exploit the vulnerabilities of the chain for personal benefits."

This funding is targeted at companies that can help drive the adoption and efficiency of renewable energy systems within the Bitcoin ecosystem.  As a publicly-traded firm with an eye for Bitcoin (BTC) investments, the move by Square Inc. to go carbon neutral within the next decade follows the firm's growing efforts to help combat climate change and correspondingly make the Bitcoin supply chain greener.

"418",709,2020-12-03,"Brave New Coin","Climatetrade is a new blockchain-marketplace for CO2 carbon offsetting. The Universal Protocol Alliance has launched Universal Carbon (UPCO2), a tradable carbon token on a public blockchain designed to offset an individual’s carbon footprint.  There is a growing awareness around the globe that recognizes the need to address the climate challenge. With no easy solutions, it will take a combined effort by governments, companies, and individuals to reduce carbon footprints across all sectors. This week, the New Zealand government  a climate crisis with prime minister Jacinda Ardern stating that climate change is “one of the greatest challenges of our time” and pledging a carbon-neutral government by 2025.  According to the World Bank, in 2020, humanity compensates for just 22% of global emissions through the purchase of carbon credits, and yet the proportion of countries operating regulated carbon markets has risen from 40 percent of global GDP in 2016 to. The result is that new demand may soon outstrip the production of new carbon credits.  Climatetrade builds on Algorand  , the blockchain-based marketplace for CO2 carbon offsetting, has selected the  blockchain network as its primary infrastructure layer. Climatetrade raised €1Million in a seed round led by Borderless Capital. The funds will support the company’s strategic plan and expansion goals.  Based in Spain, Climatetrade’s mission is to help companies achieve their sustainability goals, and eventually carbon neutrality by offering them carbon offsetting services and the ability to finance climate projects. Climatetrade has just launched an API that allows its users to purchase carbon-neutral products and services from the different companies in its blockchain marketplace.  Climatetrade users have access to a marketplace where they can directly offset their carbon footprint by selecting carbon credits, along with a record of all their transactions in a private dashboard. Climatetrade users include corporations such as Iberia, Melià Hotels, Cabify, and Telefónica. The benefits of using a blockchain-based solution is the increased transparency, access, and traceability that a blockchain provides.  W. Sean Ford, COO of Algorand, says that Climatetrade's usage of Algorand to underpin a global marketplace for carbon offsetting represents a shift in how organizations can achieve carbon neutrality. ""By making carbon offsetting more easily accessible and efficient, Climatetrade is poised to make a positive environmental impact through its network, all with blockchain.""  Borderless Capital invests capital and builds financial products to accelerate the adoption of the Algorand borderless economy. Borderless Capital’s capital raise for Climatetrade will allow the company to access new markets in the United States. Climatetrade now plans to open an office in Silicon Valley to provide its solutions to American companies seeking to offset their CO2 emissions.  The Universal Carbon token  Earlier this week, The Universal Protocol Alliance (UPA), a coalition of blockchain companies including Bittrex Global, Ledger, Certik, Infinigold, and Uphold, launched Universal Carbon (UPCO2), a tradable carbon token that can be bought as an investment, or burnt to offset an individual’s carbon footprint. Universal Protocol Alliance’s vision is that every asset class will be digitized and tokenized. The alliance of blockchain companies is building a tokenization platform to achieve this.  As the global demand for carbon credits grows, solutions such as ClimateTrade and the UPCO2 Token will provide access to this new asset class. Eventually, this could lead to the establishment of a global clearing price for carbon (similar to commodities as oil and gold).  Each UPCO2 Token represents one year-ton of CO2 pollution credited by a certified REDD+ project preventing rainforest loss or degradation. Every token is backed by a Voluntary Carbon Unit, VCU, a digital certificate issued by, the international standards agency, which allows certified projects to turn their greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions into tradable carbon credits.  “The projects we support through carbon credit purchases prevent deforestation in the Amazon, Congo Basin and Indonesia as well as other threatened rainforests,” said UP Alliance Chairman, Matthew Le Merle. “For a new generation of investors looking for more than mere financial return, UPCO2 offers attractive social, economic, and environmental benefits. At a key moment for climate change, UPCO2 allows people worldwide to do good for the planet.”"

UPCO2 is now available on Uphold, to trade or to offset corporate carbon footprints with each token representing one ton per year of carbon dioxide.  The Universal Protocol Alliance (UPA), a coalition of leading blockchain companies including Bittrex Global, Ledger, Certik, Infinigold and Uphold, today launches Universal Carbon (UPCO2), the world's first tradable carbon token on a public blockchain that can be bought and held as an investment or burnt to offset an individual's carbon footprint.  With demand for carbon credits outstripping supply by a factor of 4 to 1 in 2020, according to the World Bank, the UPCO2 Token is set to democratize an important new asset class, which could lead to the establishment of a global clearing price for carbon (as today exists for such commodities as oil and gold) and more resources going into environmental projects.  Each UPCO2 Token represents one year-ton of CO2 pollution averted by a certified REDD+ project preventing rainforest loss or degradation. Every Token is backed by a Voluntary Carbon Unit, VCU, a digital certificate issued by Verra, the international standards agency, which allows certified projects to turn their greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions into tradable carbon credits.  UP Alliance Chairman, Matthew Le Merle:  The projects we support through carbon credit purchases prevent deforestation in the Amazon, Congo Basin and Indonesia as well as other threatened rainforests[ ] For a new generation of investors looking for more than mere financial return, UPCO2 offers attractive social, economic and environmental benefits. At a key moment for climate change, UPCO2 allows people worldwide to do good for the planet and potentially do well for themselves.  Powerful macroeconomic forces underpin the Voluntary Carbon Credit market and, according to some commentators, could drive up prices significantly as more countries introduce regulated CO2 markets, forcing companies to compensate for their pollution. Additionally, a growing number of firms and individuals are choosing to offset their carbon footprints voluntarily.  Combating Climate Change with Tokenization  Universal Protocol Alliance's vision is that every asset class will be digitized and tokenized.  According to the World Bank, in 2020, humanity compensates for just 22% of global emissions through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits, and yet the proportion of countries operating regulated carbon markets has risen from 40 percent of global GDP in 2016 to 70 percent in 2020. The result is a wall of demand that may far outstrip the production of new carbon credits, which is choked by the slow and expensive process of Voluntary Carbon Project certification.  This year may go down as the key inflection point for climate change, said JP Thieriot, Co-Founder of the UP Alliance and CEO of Uphold. The year it went from a far-off issue enshrined in distant accords like Kyoto and Paris, to an existential threat affecting the lives of tens of millions of people. In recent months, we've seen Australia and California on fire, ever more powerful hurricanes, the US president-elect Joe Biden announcing a Climate Administration, and companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Nike voluntarily committing to carbon neutrality.  Thieriot added:  Combating climate change is likely to become the dominant economic issue of the next 20 years. The UPCO2 Token allows people everywhere to participate in this hugely important - and potentially lucrative - new market, as well as do the right thing for the planet.  Voluntary carbon credits, which back all UPCO2 Tokens, offer major economic advantages compared with regulated credits. As dollar-denominated, globally-recognized, fungible and perennial assets, voluntary credits last forever, maintaining option value, until consumed or retired by a company or an individual seeking to compensate for carbon footprint.  It's astonishing that there is no single global clearing price for carbon emissions, said Le Merle. A non-deliverable, digitally-tradable commodity that's essential for human activity shouldn't be traded bilaterally on OTC markets, as carbon credits are today. One year-ton of carbon means the same everywhere. As a globally-recognized asset, defined by international standards, a Voluntary Carbon Credit should eventually fetch the same price anywhere.  Matthew Le Merle said:  We believe that the UPCO2 token has an important role to play in democratizing access to carbon credits, which could eliminate price arbitrage and produce a single global price. This was a light bulb going on for me. Combine a digital asset with a rainforest carbon offset and give everyone in the world access. How could that not be a great idea?"

At the time of writing, Ethereum's launch pad has  that 294,304 ETH has been locked in, an impressive amount staked considering the lack of validators that was  last week.  According to lead Ethereum coordinator Danny Ryan, the staked investments must be locked in seven days before December 1. If the required amount of Ether is not locked in by November 24, the genesis of ETH 2.0 will once again be delayed.  Co-founder Vitalik Buterin has taken the optimistic approach as validator participation seems to have surged in a short period of time. Compared to last week, when the staking balance was just nearing 20% of its threshold, this is good progress. Buterin :  The #eth2 deposit contract has reached more than half of its target (currently at ~278000 ETH deposited), with the bulk of the deposits taking place in the last three days!  Why will the beacon chain be better than a PoW blockchain?  The Ethereum 2.0 mainnet will feature the first phase of the new blockchain update, which will be a beacon chain. The mainnet's goal will be to transition to a pure proof-of-stake protocol, as opposed to the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus many cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin run on.  An Ethereum pioneer retweeted by Buterin vouched for Ethereum's beacon chain's efficacy and faster transaction time in comparison with a proof-of-work chain. In addressing what should be expected of the beacon chain, he said:  Faster sync times, better light client guarantees, reduced (maybe 0) selfish mining' risk, per-confirm reversion probability much lower in normal case (no attacks + good global network latency), better randomness, reduced losses if unexpected quantum breakthroughs appear.  According to many, the  will also be great for sustainability, as it will be more energy-efficient than proof-of-work blockchains. In addition, stakers stand to gain more profits with ETH 2.0, and  the computing power or the amount of transactions that can be processed by software at a given time will also be increased.  In tandem with Ethereum's anticipated mainnet launch and Bitcoin's bullish rally, Ethereum's price has also . It has gained over 24% in the past week, currently  north of $580 on CoinMarketCap.

The garment industry is prevalent with these attitudes, as illustrated by younger demographics. Notably:  A recent survey of European consumers by Morning Consult commissioned by IBM found that 75% of respondents said they are concerned about the level of waste in the fashion industry. Furthermore, 64% of respondents said they would be more likely to buy the garment if new technologies could prove sustainability claims.  Millennial consumers are continuously advocating for conscious consumerism because they are attentive to detail on what they eat or drink, for instance, knowing how their food was grown and its origin, and whether it was produced ethically and sustainably.  This perception made Starbucks blockchain technology to track coffee from bean to store in August. It viewed this approach as a stepping stone towards getting a competitive edge when attracting sustainably-minded young consumers who have developed the habit of favoring small craft shops, which roast their coffee in-house."

IOTA co-founder Dominik Schiener addressed the benefits of using blockchain for supply chain demands. According to him, distributed ledger technology (DLT) has revolutionized the industry by creating demand chains, which provide real-time solutions to customers. He explained the efficiency of leveraging DLT for supply chains:  Market demand could be met automatically as soon as it exists, rather than waiting for total supply to run out. This would empower businesses to not only have a wealth of supply chain data, but reform their supply chain processes to become more efficient and create a more sustainable future.  By using data across the supply chain, demand chains could be generated, where reactions to customer demand would be instantaneous, providing in-time delivery, eliminating excess stock and waste in the system, from warehousing to transportation to retailer stock. With demand chains, a constant data stream will enable supply to be based on immediate demands, as opposed to ordering supply based on data analyzing how many times a given item was ordered in the past.  By using data linked to every check point, demand chains leveraging distributed ledger technology would be highly efficient, as it will improve supply chain management at every level, from the warehouse to the export process. Schiener  :  Instead of waiting for the market to react to a product, a demand chain would ideally react directly and in real-time to consumer behaviors and have data linked all the way back to the actual supply side.  Finally, using distributed ledger technology will create a more sustainable future, and aid in addressing environmental threats such as carbon emissions.

Market sentiments seem to be divided on whether the US presidential elections will affect the crypto realm. Historically, US presidential elections have been known to have a direct impact on traditional stock markets,  to Forbes analysts. In fact, it appears as though stock markets have a history of performing better when current presidents are re-elected, as compared to new administrations.  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have typically been reported to surge in tandem with traditional stocks. However, with Bitcoin's recent bull run, market experts have  that the mainstream cryptocurrency has finally been decoupling from traditional markets, as BTC has managed to perform bullishly while US stocks have plummeted.  Bitcoin unaffected by US elections  Bitcoin recently surpassed the 14K mark today for the second time this week and seems to be gaining momentum as of late. Currently, it has fallen back slightly to record $13,885.59 on .  Many institutions have turned towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies as hedges, with the depreciation of the US dollar. Aside from US elections, institutional mass adoption of BTC from corporate giants such as MicroStrategy, Grayscale, and Square has served to bolster the positive sentiment investors have towards cryptocurrencies, potentially converting more retail traders to onboard the digital asset.  In an email to Blockchain.News , Head of Research at Blockchain.com and top UK economist Dr. Garrick Hileman disclosed:  Regardless of who wins the election, high fiscal spending will continue to exacerbate the debt sustainability crisis and inevitably drive rising interest in bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.  One thing is for sure: regardless of the outcome of the presidential elections, Bitcoin may likely undergo a surge when the second round of stimulus packages roll out. As the US dollar continues to depreciate with the mass printing of fiat for stimulus COVID-19 relief, this may direct investors' attention towards hedges such as Bitcoin to secure their funds in the midst of global economic uncertainty. Hileman said:  The US dollar is the world's reserve currency because there's trust in the US government's reliability and stability. For the first time, we are seeing that perception challenged in a significant way, at a time when a promising new class of (digital) assets are gaining momentum.  He added:  Anything that negatively impacts the perception of a safe and stable dollar will likely boost interest in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  What about US crypto regulations?  However, in terms of cryptocurrency regulations in the US, it appears that it has been criticized for its lack of a clear regulatory framework. For example, the cryptocurrency enforcement framework released by the US Department of Justice drove Ripple founders to contemplate moving their company headquarters to a more crypto-friendly space such as Japan.  Current president Donald Trump has also stated time and again that he was no fan of cryptocurrencies, as they are too volatile in his opinion. He previously , Unregulated crypto-assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity  As for Joe Biden, the presidential hopeful has not broached the topic of cryptocurrencies in his political campaign, although his political campaign has jokingly said it would not adopt Bitcoin following the Twitter hack that saw Biden's account frozen.

How could blockchain benefit the world?  While blockchain is most known as the underlying infrastructure supporting cryptocurrencies, PwC experts reviewed other key advantages of the distributed ledger technology (DLT).  The new report released by PwC assessed how blockchain technology could be leveraged to benefit and boost the economy worldwide. Five case scenarios in which blockchain could be used to drive the digital revolution forward included provenance the tracking and tracing of products and services payments and financial services, identity management, and the application of blockchain in contracts and dispute resolution as well as customer engagement.  The analysis evaluated blockchain technology's potential across different industries, from healthcare, government and public services to finance, logistics, retail, and more.  Speaking about the potential  blockchain technology could be used, Steve Davies, a Partner and Blockchain Leader at PwC UK, :  Blockchain technology has long been associated with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, but there is so much more that it has to offer, particularly in how public and private organisations secure, share and use data.  Who would benefit the most from blockchain?  According to PwC analysts, Asia stands to  the most economic benefits from blockchain technology over other continents.  In terms of countries, China and the US were designated as the ones that could potentially gain the highest net benefits from blockchain, estimated at $440 billion and $407 billion respectively, according to data from PwC. The net benefits of five countries, notably Germany, Japan, the UK, France, and India were also calculated to surpass $50 billion.  However, from one country to another, the sectors that would reap the highest benefits from blockchain technology differed. While the US stands to benefit the most from leveraging blockchain for security, payments issuance, identity, and credentials purposes, China and Germany would gain from using DLT more for provenance and traceability, as both countries possessed manufacturing-focused economies.  Overall, across all sectors, the public administration, healthcare, and education industry appears to be the biggest beneficiaries, with PwC expecting them to gain approximately $574 billion by 2030 through using blockchain for identity and credentials.  Blockchain adoption accelerated by COVID-19  Speaking of blockchain digital innovation and of its budding potential amid the economic havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Davies remarked:  As organisations grapple with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, many disruptive trends have been accelerated. The analysis shows the potential for blockchain to support organisations in how they rebuild and reconfigure their operations underpinned by improvements in trust, transparency and efficiency across organisations and society.  Findings from PricewaterhouseCoopers revealed that two-thirds of CEOs surveyed 61% of them placed digital transformation of core business operations among their top three priorities in their quest to rebuild their commerce from damage caused by COVID-19.  If blockchain's economic potential was achieved, PwC and sector experts warn that the distributed ledger technology's energy overhead must be managed properly. The impact of technology and global energy consumption by various organizations must be taken into consideration to reduce climate change repercussions."

The conclusions of the open market consultation should be  early next month, October 2020.  The EBSI will be a public infrastructure with high requirements of scalability and throughput, interoperability, security, robustness, reduced environmental footprint, energy efficiency and continuity of the service and should be deployed within the next 3 years.  The EC, EBP, and Rise of Digital Payments Like XRP  Based on the conclusions of the open market consultation, the coming PCP is expected to focus on the development of future capacities for EBSI in view of supporting new types of use cases that involve a high volume of transactions concerning physical or digital objects.  There are currently large gaps in existing blockchain solutions to enable the delivery of more demanding cross-border blockchain services, one such area is instant payments.

The proposal stipulates the urge for a sound legal framework for crypto assets as current EU financial services laws have previously left them out.  The Commission noted that more stringent requirements might be necessitated for stablecoins as they have the likelihood of being widely adopted. As a result, a bespoke regime for stablecoins and crypto assets should come in handy in areas like wallet services and crypto exchanges.  The EC's new legal framework could benefit technology such as that developed by the payment solutions company Ripple. Through its  payment solution, Ripple is able to offer low-cost instant cross-border payment services with XRP.  A European regulated framework could also create more legitimacy for cryptocurrency payments with the main tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum and Litecoin. However, it will depend on the legal framework presented by the European Commission.  According to a by Reuters:  By 2024, the EU should put in place a comprehensive framework enabling the uptake of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and crypto-assets in the financial sector [ ] It should also address the risks associated with these technologies."
"435",512,2020-09-25,"Blockchain.News","Despite speculations that the decentralized finance () industry is rapidly approaching bubble territory, the Winklevoss twins affirmed the contrary, saying that the current DeFi craze is a revolution in the making.  Is the DeFi bubble going to burst?  This week, DeFi tokens have been in the red, with the crypto market struggling to stay afloat and maintain an upward trend. Some of the largest DeFi tokens by market capitalization have  high double-digit price dips this week, such as UMA, YFI (Yearn.Finance), LEND (Aave), and COMP (Compound).  However, despite the bearish momentum, the Winklevoss twins have asserted that DeFi's boom was here to stay. The Bitcoin billionaires backed the Ethereum-based financial protocols, saying that the current DeFi boom was nothing like the 2017 initial coin offering craze , where ICO became highly popularized before the crypto bubble burst, with nearly half of the projects failing by 2018.  Gemini co-founder Cameron Winklevoss :  DeFi is not the same as the 2017 ICO craze. Back then, money was raised on shitcoin white papers written in a coffee shop. DeFi is already live and working in the wild. Billions of dollars are at work earning positive yield. This isn't hypothetical vaporware, this is real.  Winklevoss expressed that the current decentralized finance hype was here to stay, going against a major concern that many investors seem to be having. Some crypto experts, such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin, expressed that DeFi seemed to be unsustainable in the long run.  Buterin previously  the sharp supply inflation perceived among many governance tokens and said that they would have to be printed constantly to keep the underlying ecosystem running. In the long run, yield farming tokens would prove to be unsustainable, according to the Ethereum co-founder.  Cameron Winklevoss and Buterin appear to be divided on their stance about the DeFi industry's sustainability. Tyler Winklevoss backed his brother and  through a tweet:  Yield is something you used to earn from your bank. Now you earn it from a smart contract. The #DeFi revolution is upon us  Yield farming consists of a way in which DeFi projects award governance tokens to users who generate liquidity, either through borrowing, lending, or token exchange.  The gained crypto assets are locked into a specific DeFi protocol, which operates off the Ethereum blockchain for the most part. It is in a way comparable to the annual interest an investor can earn from keeping money in a traditional banking institution.  Uniswap's UNI bounces back  Currently, despite the observed downtrend of the majority of the crypto market, Uniswap's UNI token has  a rebound within the past 24 hours, making an 11 percent gain within a day. UNI token was only launched last week, with one billion governance tokens minted. At the time of writing, Uniswap's platform is ranked first on the DeFi market in terms of total value locked (TVL), estimated to be worth $1.7 billion cryptocurrencies."

With this approach, the company hopes to shed light on its livestock source following mounting pressure from investors and Amazon activists about getting cattle from illegally deforested lands.  Tracing cattle throughout their lives  The Sao Paulo-based company has been criticized by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) for not being at the forefront of ensuring that it is not supplied with cattle from unlawfully deforested Amazonian lands. Additionally, the Brazilian government has found itself in hot soup from the international community for the severe destruction of the Amazon rainforest.  JBS seeks to avert this problem by unveiling a digital ledger, which will be instrumental in tracing its livestock origin. It also intends to give suppliers the power to monitor individual supply chains in the next five years. The ledger is to be audited by external parties. As per the announcement:  The new platform will provide an essential layer of information to enable cattle to be traced throughout their lives and ensure any cattle from producers involved in illegal deforestation cannot enter the JBS supply chain.  Driving the sustainability agenda  Investors have lauded this development as it is a significant step forward in driving the sustainability agenda forward.  Petterson Vale, an agricultural consultant in the Amazon, said:  The use of blockchain is excellent. It is a great technology. But the important question is where the data is coming from and what is the legal framework behind the cattle transaction data you're using.

"437",1101,2020-09-23,"Blockchain.News","In stocks, company profit margins and operating expenses are top priorities in fundamental analysis. Fundamental analysis in forex currencies could involve looking at each nation's GDP or country's political health. Commodity fundamental analysis looks at supply, demand, and environmental factors.  But when it comes to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, fundamental analysis is vastly different. It involves terminology unusual to finance like hash rates, proof-of-work consensus algorithms, block reward halvings, and all kinds of bizarre barometers of network health.  However, these measurements, when combined with technical analysis, can be extremely telling about where Bitcoin is in its current market cycle. And with the current state of the Bitcoin network along with pure technicals closely mimicking the previous bull market breakout, the latest dip in the cryptocurrency could be the last opportunity of a lifetime to ""buy the dip.""  analysts have put together a compelling case as to why Bitcoin fundamentals are more bullish than ever, and how technicals back up the bullish momentum. Here are all the crucial factors to carefully consider before taking any position in the crypto market.  Bitcoin Network Healthier Than Ever, Crypto Fundamentals Could Fuel Rapid Rise  News broke this week that Bitcoin's hash rate, the unit of measurement representing the combined processing power of all of the miners contributing to securing the Bitcoin network, reached a new all-time high.  Not only that, but the critical metric surged some of the largest it ever has week over week, all while Bitcoin price plunged over $2,000. Despite the drop, there are very few if any signals in Bitcoin charts, fundamental, technical, or otherwise, that would suggest more bearish downside.  The increase in hash rate could signal more miners are getting into Bitcoin with it becoming a more profitable venture once again. Miners could also be building up their processing power ahead of the next bull market to remain competitive. Whatever the reason, the cryptocurrency's hash rate skyrocketing is anything but bearish.  A moving average tool based on Bitcoin's hash rate and mining difficulty called the hash ribbons were developed by crypto fundamental expert Charles Edwards, who used the tool to signal when miners are capitulating. More importantly, the tool also signals when this process is over, which has thus far been the most lucrative buy signal in Bitcoin history. That signal just triggered again.  Stock-To-Flow's Time To Shine, Or Else It May Be Time For Plan C  Much of Bitcoin's value and even its recent bullish momentum are due to its hard-coded digital scarcity. The max Bitcoin supply is 21 million BTC, and even less exist due to what's currently circulating and what's been lost forever.  In an attempt to affix a valuation based on this scarcity, regularly adjusted for Bitcoin's reducing block reward that cuts the BTC supply miners receive in half every four years, a pseudonymous analyst named Plan B has developed what's called the stock-to-flow model.  The stock-to-flow model is one of the most important, realistic, yet polarizing valuation methods available for Bitcoin. Those vehemently opposed to the model argue that Bitcoin market cycles are lengthening, while those that subscribe to the theory believe that the halving causes bull runs.  According to the theory, lower supply entering the market caused demand to outweigh supply and the asset's valuation to take off like a rocket after each halving. Bitcoin's halving is now months in the past, and although the asset is climbing, we haven't seen the same explosion as the last bull market. However, as fundamentals are signaling, that's what could lie next in the crypto market. If not, and ""Plan B"" fails, ""Plan C"" could stand for ""crash"" if investors suddenly stop believing in the theory and sell in a panic.  Bitcoin Technicals Support Fundamental Growth And New Uptrend  Failure here, however, is unlikely, as fundamentals suggest. And backing up the strong fundamental signals in Bitcoin are just as powerful technical patterns.  Technical analysis is a practice designed to increase the probability of success by predicting market movements based on patterns and other signals. Various indicators also are used to predict Bitcoin going up or down or even sideways.  The current technical structure on monthly timeframes shows a massive, multi-year symmetrical triangle breakout out of its resistance and confirming that resistance line as support. There is also a bullish retest of horizontal support taking place at the exact same time. Both of these key levels are holding up, post-halving, just like the last market cycle. And both cycles formed the same type of pattern which is typically a bullish continuation pattern.  Long Bitcoin With PrimeXBT And Ride With The Cryptocurrency Bulls  After the breakout and retest of support turned resistance, Bitcoin price rallied from $1,000 to $20,000 in just over a year. Technical analysis is not an exact science, but statistics show that in more than half of all patterns at 63%, break out to the upside. If the movement prior to the symmetrical triangle was upward before the formation, that number increases to 89% of cases.  81% of all symmetrical triangle bullish breakouts reach their projected measured move target. In Bitcoin's case, the target is well over $100,000 per BTC matching with some expert  and valuation-based projections such as the stock-to-flow model.  If this is the case, taking a long position on Bitcoin using a  platform such as PrimeXBT could end up being a trade of a lifetime. Past results don't necessarily guarantee future performance, and an unusual amount of risk hangs over markets that could suggest this time is different than the last.  However, if history repeats and the halving theories such as stock-to-flow are proven correct, this recent crash could be the last dip ever. Analysis from the award-winning PrimeXBT shows Bitcoin fundamentals and technicals healthier and more bullish than Bitcoin has been in the previous three years. So long as proper risk management strategies are considered and followed, the upside reward could ultimately be worth the risk.  PrimeXBT offers long and short positions on CFDs for crypto, forex, stock indices, and commodities, along with all of the risk management tools to take a chance with Bitcoin. Traders unsure exactly how to approach positioning themselves can also follow other more skilled traders through PrimeXBT's newly launched ."

As a highly decentralized financial infrastructure with a platform that has thrived independently, Uniswap states it is now particularly well-positioned for community-led growth, development, and self-sustainability. The introduction of UNI (ERC-20) serves this purpose, enabling shared community ownership and a vibrant, diverse, and dedicated governance system, which will actively guide the protocol towards the future.  Per the Blog:  UNI officially enshrines Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.  Uniswap states it will launch a liquidity mining program on Sept. 18, targeting its USDT, USDC, DAI, and wBTC pools.  In terms of governance of the UNI token all Uni holders will have ownership of the governance process. Uniswap's blog post said that team members will not participate directly in governance for the foreseeable future, but noted that team members could delegate votes to protocol delegates, and all UNI holders will have ownership of the governance process. Additionally, all Uni tokens dedicated to employees, investors, and advisors have a four-year vesting schedule."

Far-reaching opportunities  The United Nations' FAO believes that change is imminent in the seafood industry as blockchain will provide far-reaching opportunities like immutable storage and enhanced transparency. For instance, this cutting-edge technology can offer fishers more precise weather forecasts and satellite positioning, which will make its operations more predictable, safer, and more precise.  On the other hand, mobile and advanced robotic technologies are revamping the sector with the former availing capabilities like real-time fish market prices, and the latter prompting the automatic filleting of fish.

As per the report:  The use of disruptive technologies in fisheries and aquaculture may not be widespread now, but a look at three disruptive technologies that were not on the sector's horizon a few years ago blockchains, sensors, and automatic identification systems (AIS) demonstrates the potential of disruptive technology to change the processes, profitability, and sustainability of the sector.  Conscious consumers  Consumers are continuously changing their ways as they are becoming very particular about what they eat or drink. The seafood sector is not an exemption as consumers are favoring more sustainably-caught fish from transparent and traceable sources.  Blockchain will, therefore, come in handy in availing this information by enabling fishers to provide on-demand products from safe and selective fisheries.

It is slated for September 21, 2020.  While the OPEC body has recognized the need to integrate blockchain technology as a pressing issue' in the energy industry, it's consideration is in using the technology to enhance the global Supply Chain in the oil industry.

"441",641,2020-09-02,"Blockchain.News","Vitalik Buterin has criticized the yield farming craze that has been ongoing in the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) sector, comparing it to the US Federal Reserve's mass printing strategy.  Buterin thinks yield farming is unsustainable  The Ethereum co-founder has advised against the yield farming strategy that has gained increasing popularity among the DeFi community and that has partially enabled digital assets such as the Yield.finance (YFI) governance token to gain traction in the market. The DeFi token recently  a new record-high of $39,600 on coin exchange Binance , surging by 25%.  Buterin called out the craze of yield farming and said that it was a short-term thing, implying that it was not realistic in the long run. He addressed the sharp supply inflation of many governance tokens, indicating that coins would have to be constantly printed for the ecosystem to keep on running, which was far from ideal for sustainability issues. Taking to his Twitter, Buterin  :  Seriously, the sheer volume of coins that needs to be printed nonstop to pay liquidity providers in these 50-100%/year yield farming regimes makes major national central banks look like they're all run by Ron Paul.  Ron Paul is a retired politician who criticized the establishment of the Federal Reserve and who ran for President of the United States on three separate occasions. Buterin, who is currently working on a multiclient testnet project Medalla to attain a full proof-of-stake protocol, is a solid advocate of staking a software protocol that rewards you with more crypto when you use your digital assets to verify transactions and support the blockchain network.  Scalability issues with DeFi run on Ethereum?  As with yield farming, the DeFi platform awards governance tokens to users who generate liquidity, either through borrowing, lending, or token exchange. These tokens can be used to vote on proposals to update a blockchain network. Governance tokens offer a large monetary reward, as evidenced by DeFi tokens Yearn.finance (YFI) and Aave (  )'s digital yields. However, as more tokens have been locked into DeFi projects, their supply is limited.  As DeFi protocols operate mainly on the Ethereum blockchain and the DeFi industry is currently booming and increasingly leveraged by emerging economies, concerns about the Ethereum network's scalability have once again resurfaced. Due to the complexity of smart contract protocols on Ethereum and most DeFi projects running on the open-source blockchain platform, transaction fees to unlock basic operations have hit triple-figures.  Buterin has announced that sharding will be tested out in Phase 1 of Medalla testnet , which is the final testnet set in place before a complete transition to proof-of-stake is adopted by Ethereum. Buterin hopes that  can be worked out with Medalla test chain, before Ethereum 2.0 mainnet's anticipated launch,  for the end of 2022 if all goes well.

Symbol is a protocol upgrade of NEM’s enterprise blockchain which is due to launch later this year.  The data published on Symbol is then stored in an immutable form on the Interplanetary File System (IFPS), which is a distributed decentralized database. According to Ivanova, storing the content both in Symbol Blockchain and IPFS allows the platform to have proof of form, proof of time stamp, and proof of immutability.  “As long-standing members of the blockchain community, we’ve followed the NEM project for years, and the Symbol blockchain suits perfectly for intellectual property management. Symbol has a layered architecture that enables trustlessness, and performance optimisation, which was a natural fit for our solution,” commented Ivanova. “We’re excited to work with the NEM Ventures team to further develop our product, with the aim of making copyright and intellectual property protection more accessible and equitable.”  To date, SharpShark has tested its solution with the journalists’ union Cispen, and the project is currently participating in the Start-Up Chile Seed acceleration program. Start-Up Chile is a public startup accelerator created by the Chilean Government for high-potential entrepreneurs to bootstrap their startups and use Chile as a foundation.  Start-Up Chile is the leading accelerator in Latin America and is among the Top 10 accelerators globally. The Seed Acceleration program is a six-month program for companies with a functional product and early validation. The accelerator funds up to 50,000,000 Chilean Peso, which is current ~US$80,000."

"449",480,2020-07-09,"Blockchain.News","Ripple claims that its cryptocurrency, XRP, is 57,000 times more environmentally friendly than the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin.  According to Ripple's  , the firm criticizes Bitcoin's consensus mechanism, proof-of-work (PoW), as a major issue contributing to the vast amounts of energy consumed for validating and processing transactions on the network. Other cryptocurrencies that use PoW as its consensus mechanism include Litecoin, Monero, Dash, Zcash, and Verge.  As users broadcast transactions to the network, miners who create the block which is then added to the network, uses some of their own resources, including computing power, which is used to hash the block's data until a solution to the cryptographic puzzle is found.  With the growing number of miners in the community, miners compete against each other to solve the puzzle and verify the block, which then earns them a reward is to use more computational power to solve the puzzle quickly.  Ripple's post, written by Ripple's CTO David Schwartz mentioned that with an application-specific device, ASIC miner, has an environmental cost of $1,500 per year for mining, while newer versions of mining machines could cost as much as $6,000 per year.  A study conducted in 2018 found that the hundreds of thousands of computers that were used to solve cryptographic puzzles working 24 hours a day to mine Bitcoin consumed 1.5 times the yearly energy consumption of Ireland.  Ripple says XRP is a green cryptocurrency  According to Ripple's blog post, XRP was designed with sustainability in mind, and claims the cryptocurrency to be inherently green. Unlike Bitcoin, where there is a maximum supply to be mined, all XRP is already in existence, meaning no additional mining processes that require energy consumption will be needed to produce more.  The unsustainable mining practices and proof-of-work mechanism behind Bitcoin and Ethereum are massive barriers for the more widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies. But not all blockchains are made equally.  Ripple compared the energy consumption between 1 million transactions of XRP and Bitcoin. 1 million transactions in XRP could power 79,000 lightbulb hours, and 1 million transactions in Bitcoin could power 4.51 billion lightbulb hours, meaning XRP is 57,000 times more efficient than Bitcoin, according to the post.

"454",984,2020-06-02,"Brave New Coin","Max Webster is an Investor at Version One VC. Webster is focused on investing in and helping entrepreneurs build an open internet, financial system, and energy grid. Prior to Version One, Webster founded Entiende Bitcoin, a consultancy focused on increasing access to bitcoin and stablecoins in Latin America. Webster was also part of the founding team at Bright, the leading residential solar company in Mexico.  Max Webster graduated from Yale University with a Bachelors Degree in Political Science. Webster had always been fascinated by technology, particularly with solar energy, and believes that “climate change is one of the most important challenges our generation has to overcome.”  After graduating, Webster spent the first six to seven years out of college working on various energy-related startups. In January 2015, Webster joined the founding team of a company called Bright. A company which offers residential solar for the developing world. The company has gone on to raise over US$10M from investors including Susa Ventures, First Round Capital, Felicis Ventures and Max Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal.  Webster first came across Bitcoin in 2011, while he was a university student. “I thought the idea was really cool,” he told Brave New Coin, “but I thought there is no way that it would work and boy was I wrong.”  Through his work at Bright, while looking into the idea of decentralised energy markets and decentralised energy grids in 2016, Webster rediscovered Bitcoin and blockchain technology. He was researching if there is a way consumers can trade either tokenised renewable energy credits and/or kilowatt-hours without the use of a centralised utility in the middle.  After realising that Bitcoin was still going strong, Webster got deeply interested and dived into the underlying technology, consuming all content he could find to learn more. He states that in “a few months into it I quickly realised that in my opinion, this was going to be the biggest technological shakeup, biggest revolution, most interesting perhaps thing in our generation, and I decided I had to be a part of it.”  Webster subsequently left Bright and spent a couple of years consulting via his firm Entiende Bitcoin. He worked with GiveCrypto, which is Coinbase’s non-profit arm and Bitso, the largest crypto exchange in Mexico, doing user and market studies for crypto adoption in Mexico.  Through his research, Webster noted two things. One, people really wanted an alternative to their own currency. The vast majority of people believe that the Peso was going to devalue, but other than a bank account denominated in their own currency, the only savings alternative they had to was physical USD.  Webster explains that “there was huge appetite for digital dollars, so stablecoins, and also once they kind of start understanding Bitcoin, which took usually two or three sessions, to get the idea across. Most of them wanted to have a little bit of exposure to Bitcoin as well.”  The second thing he noted was the need for an easy, fast, cheap way for individuals to send either remittances or payments back to their family and friends in other countries. Bitcoin and stablecoins were both very interesting instruments for those individuals.  Webster was later introduced to two partners of Version One VC, Boris Wertz and Angela Tran, through his contacts at Coinbase. Version One, founded in 2012, is an early-stage fund investing in consumer internet, SaaS, and crypto entrepreneurs.  Webster mentioned that he joined the fund because “they were very focussed on crypto but not only crypto,” and because the fund is really small. Webster is only the third team member and the size of the fund os US$45M, allowing them to focus on early-stage entrepreneurs.  In regards to the funds crypto thesis, Webster mentioned that they are interested in, “money wrapped in code,” which he broadly terms financial services, and then voting, “voting as a ledger of value and ledger of intent.” The team is also interested in, but at a lesser extent, non-fungible tokens.  Webster also discusses his interest in DeFi and the potential for Bitcoin to be brought into the DeFi ecosystem. “I think a lot of people are going to be much more comfortable using Bitcoin as collateral for various assets, for various apps within Ethereum. You only need to look at the spot and futures market of Bitcoin versus everything else to understand that the liquidity is on a different playing field. I think it’s inevitable,” he states.  In regards to how this will occur, Webster has two thoughts. Firstly, a bridge could be built that locks up Bitcoin and trustlessly mints an Ethereum based representation of that Bitcoin as ERC-20 tokens, or entrepreneurs can try and rebuild some of the financial primitives on top of Bitcoin, such as a decentralized contracts for difference platform on top of Bitcoin.  The most recent investment Version One VC has made is in Lolli, a rewards application that allows users to earn bitcoin when shopping online. Version One participated in the US$3M seed round for Lolli, which was led by Founders Fund and saw participation from Chapter One Ventures, Craft Ventures, Bain Capital, Digital Currency Group, Ashton Kutcher and Michelle Phan.  Webster stated that Version One was also investors in Lolli’s pre-seed round, and this is their second investment in the company.“It's a great business to be the on-ramp,” Webster said. “Coinbase is awesome and all the exchanges are awesome, but the reality is that there are a lot of people who are not going to go and buy Bitcoin. A lot of ‘normal people’- I think it's much more realistic for them to acquire their first Bitcoin via a rewards program, via a gift, via some kind of earning and that's why we like Lolli.”"

It’s during this first year that Binance also started to lay the groundwork for an entire blockchain ecosystem, including its own blockchain.  Binance Chain is a blockchain and peer-to-peer distributed system developed by Binance and the Binance community, which launched in April 2019. The Binance decentralized exchange (DEX) is built on Binance Chain and facilitates the exchange of digital assets that are issued and listed on the DEX. Matching happens within the blockchain nodes and all transactions are recorded on-chain, forming a complete, auditable ledger of activity.  “Binance DEX is a decentralized exchange with a decentralized network of nodes, where you hold your own private keys and manage your own wallet,” explains Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance. “With Binance DEX, we provide a different balance of security, freedom, and ease-of-use, where you take more responsibility and are in more control of your assets.”  Binance Coin () is the native coin on the Binance Chain, and powers the Binance Ecosystem. A strict limit of 200M BNB were initially created on the Ethereum blockchain as an ERC 20 compliant asset. 50% were allocated for sale in an ICO,40% were earmarked for the Founding Team, and 10% for Angel investors.  BNB can be used to pay for fees, and provides a significant discount. Users can use the asset for exchange fees, withdraw fees, and listing fees. Every quarter, a number of BNB is burned, based on the trading volume on .  On April 18th 2020, Binance completed its . This quarter’s burn was the largest in token and fiat amounts to date, totaling  equivalent to US$52.46M. So far Binance has burned a total of 20.12M BNB tokens, which amounts to approximately 10% of the total supply. In dollar terms at the current BNB price, this is equal to around US$330M.  The increase in business activity this quarter is largely attributable to the Binance Futures platform, which grew to be the number one crypto futures exchange in the world by volume. The futures platform hosts twenty-four different perpetual contracts, a popular derivative among traders, speculators, and hedgers. Binance has also recently launched itself into the , opening up another potentially lucrative income stream.  However, the most requested Binance Chain feature is programmable extendibility, or Smart Contract and Virtual Machine functions. Digital asset issuers and owners currently struggle to add new decentralized features for their assets or introduce any sort of community governance and activities. Despite this demand, the execution of a Smart Contracts on Binance Chain may slow down the DEX.  In light of this impasse, the developers behind Binance Chain recently released a  detailing the proposed specifications of a new smart contract enabled blockchain, dubbed Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The new chain will utilize the Ethereum Virtual Machine, which will enable developers to build decentralized apps on top of it.  The two Binance blockchains will be independent of each other, and will run in parallel. However, they will be connected by a cross-chain bridge for BNB, enabling the token to be used natively on both chains. The bridge will also support the movement of BEP2 tokens and Oracle communication.    BSC is also designed to be compatible with Ethereum. As stated in the whitepaper, “most of the dApps, ecosystem components, and toolings will work with BSC and require zero or minimum changes.” Nodes for BSC will also require similar or slightly higher hardware specifications and skills to run and operate, when compared to Ethereum.  The Binance Smart Chain developers have opted for a hybrid Proof-of-Authority (PoA) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, citing environmental, performance, and security concerns of the Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus algorithm. They refer to this algorithm as “Proof-of-Staked-Authority.” This should provide some notable performance gains in smart contract execution when compared to running the code on Ethereum, which currently still uses PoW.  Similar to the Delegated-Proof-of-Stake algorithm used by EOS, the novel Proof-of-Staked-Authority algorithm would have a set of twenty-one active validators who would take turns in producing blocks. The validators will be voted in by BNB stakeholders, who will have to lock up their tokens in order to receive staking rewards and vote. This mechanism can be found in other assets including EOS ().  Similar to other PoS algorithms, the Proof-of-Staked-Authority consensus algorithm will feature a mechanism to protect against the illicit behavior known as stake slashing. This feature penalizes validators for signing more than one block with the same height and parent block, which is used to solve the “nothing at stake” problem.  The loss imposed on a validator through slashing would be shared with their delegators, which encourages delegators to select honest validators. As stated in the whitepaper, the blockchain remains fully secure as long as no more than six of the twenty-one validators act maliciously.  Since BSC will be using the already established BNB token, which has a fixed supply, no new tokens will be issued as block rewards. Instead, validators will receive transaction gas fees in BNB. The amount that is paid to delegators who stake their BNB is determined by the validator that they stake with, enabling competition between validators. Every validator has an equal probability of being selected to produce a block, and thus, in the long run, should each receive a similar amount of BNB."

The Libra Association has ratified the establishment of a committee dedicated to overseeing and implementing the technical architecture of the Libra project.  The technical steering committee  Last month, Michael Engle, a lead developer at Libra,  that the Libra Association held a meeting on December 16, 2019, where they voted to set up a special panel within the organizational architecture of the Libra project.  The panel - dubbed the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) - is composed of five individuals who are tasked to oversee, create, and implement the technical underpinnings of the Libra Project. Additionally, they will design plans for the future development of the blockchain-based venture.  The five individuals who are on the TSC were chosen because they “each contribute a unique perspective and bring valuable domain expertise to the project.” Diogo Monica, George Cabrera III, Joe Lallouz, Nick Grossman, and Ric Shreves were chosen because of their extensive experience within the software and technological innovation space.  Diogo Monica holds the position of co-founder and President at Anchorage, an industry-leading digital asset custodian. He has over 15 years of experience under his belt. George Cabrera currently works as the Libra Core Product Lead at Calibra and has twenty years of experience in software engineering. He has previously worked several roles at Facebook.  Cabrera believes the initiation of the committee task force represents a move in the right direction for the Facebook-backed project. He stated: ""The Libra Association's mission is to be a financial infrastructure that empowers billions of people and having a group to guide the design, building, and ongoing maintenance of that infrastructure is vital to its success. The creation of this committee represents a notable milestone for Libra's openness and sustainability as we forge ahead towards our mainnet launch.""

Nick Grossman is a partner at Union Square Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm that focuses on investing in innovative tech-based solutions. Lastly, Ric Shreves holds the position of Director of Emerging Technology at Mercy Corps, an organization that explores how technology can be implemented in the context of humanitarian development.  Shreves reiterated the founding mission of the Libra project, referencing its oft-discussed inclusion aims. He explained: ""Designed from the outset to be transparent by default, and governed with the philosophy of open source participation, the Libra network represents a unique opportunity to build a financially inclusive world.""  An independent committee  It is important to note that the TSC is designed to be an independent committee. While Facebook has been clear that the project will be independent in all of its dealings, there have still been significant fears that Libra will be heavily influenced by its parent company. The creation of the independent TSC is likely an attempt to allay these fears.  ""Libra has the potential to be a breakthrough project in the digital asset and payments space. To achieve this potential, the project must demonstrate credible independence and be welcoming to potential partners and contributors,"" Grossman highlighted.  The TSC is tasked with directing the technical roadmap for Libra and creating Technical Working Groups to fast-track research and development for specific issues. Moreover, the committee will guide codebase development and create a good relationship with the developers who will be working on Libra-based applications.  Furthermore, the TSC plans to publish documents that will outline the technical governance framework in Q1/2020. The framework will include details on how the open-source developer community may propose technical changes to the Libra project. It will also detail how the proposal, named Libra Improvement Proposals (LIP) will be evaluated.  While the Libra project continues to face significant challenges - with the  being the latest - the project appears committed to moving forward with the launch.  Lallouz concluded: ""Our goal is to ensure the Libra network is decentralized, secure, and well-orchestrated, with the infrastructure in place to support billions of transactions.

Exchanges claim their stake  Along with the proliferation of proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies, the other factor behind the growth says Yannick Folla from Figment Networks, is the rise of staking services. These allow investors to bypass the complexity of staking and avoid the annoyance of having to validate transactions or manage a node in exchange for surrendering a cut of the revenue.  As 2019 drew to close, exchanges all around the world started to introduce automated staking services in what Folla says was an attempt to capitalize on staking by ""encouraging users to keep their tokens on the platform, while retaining partial liquidity of the assets.""  Coinbase Custody kicked off the trend by offering Tezos staking services to institutional customers in March 2019, before rolling the service out to retail investors in November. This was noted by rival Binance, which then launched a fee-free staking platform for more than half a dozen digital assets running on proof-of-stake networks. A few weeks later, U.S. exchange Kraken joined the party, allowing clients to tap into the rewards offered by Tezos.  In the East, Asian exchanges have also responded to the trend. Tokyo's Coincheck launched Lisk staking in July 2019, and Chinese exile OKEx has been gradually adding staking functionality for more and more coins.  ""Staking War""  Along with existing custodians offering staking as a side service, dedicated ‘staking-as-a-service’ platforms are springing up which are focused on generating income by pooling funds to run shared proof-of-stake nodes.  Some of these platforms, like Figment and Cryptium, aim to target institutional investors that ""might be sitting on large funds from token sales from private funding rounds,"" says Folla. Retail investors are also targeted, but the more active retail traders relying on fast liquidity are likely to opt to stake on exchanges or use staking-equipped wallets like Cobo that offer staking for a range of coins from a convenient mobile app.  As the cryptocurrency ecosystem develops and bigger players like Ethereum and Cardano shift to proof-of-stake, the amount of cryptocurrency staked is likely to continue growing. ""There is still a limited amount of new generation PoS networks at the mainnet stage,"" Folla says, ""but 2020 should see the launch of the most highly touted chains.""  But not everyone in the cryptocurrency community is keen on the development. Some voice concerns that aggregated staking will lead to concentrated governance power and increased centralization.  Angel investor Arianna Simpson suggests the trend of centralized players offering staking will result in a ""staking war"" where the winner—who has the most brand recognition and offers clients the most competitive rates—will not only get the bulk of staking rewards, but also have more sway in network governance processes like voting, and an outsized ability to determine the direction of the network. This could defeat the point of decentralization, especially for smaller, more vulnerable cryptocurrency networks.  In this situation, tweets Simpson, ""collusion becomes a real risk. Trustless networks are replaced with networks that only trust a few,"" and ""true censorship-resistance arguably goes away."""

For those business leaders not at Davos, this four-part research series breaks down and explains the emerging trends that are at the center of the discussions and offers unique insights to the WEF itself.  For the first time in the history of the WEF Global Risks Survey, environmental concerns dominate the top long-term risks by likelihood among members of the World Economic Forum’s community, including:  * Extreme weather events with major damage to property, infrastructure and loss of human life.  * Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation by governments and businesses.  * Human-made environmental damage and disasters, including environmental crime, such as oil spills, and radioactive contamination.  * Major biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse (terrestrial or marine) with irreversible consequences for the environment, resulting in severely depleted resources for humankind as well as industries.  * Major natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, and geomagnetic storms.  The carbon credit system must undergo a dramatic shift both in the price of carbon and the outdated market infrastructure for trading them to tackle climate change as needed - and in short time. This is particularly pressing given economic vulnerabilities already in place such as high debt, negative interest rates, rising income inequalities and elevated geopolitical risks.  Our latest proprietary research report Carbon Credit Tokenization is an example of our consultation work on digitizing real-world value for the new economy.  Blockchain In Enterprise Part 1 assesses the technological evolution in supply chains, the possible configurations of blockchain for enterprise, the preferred platforms and whether Ethereum still holds the most potential in enterprise, provided it can surmount scaling issues.  Blockchain in Enterprise Part 2 looks at trends in corporate and global governance that are shaping the future of trade and globalization as the Bretton Woods multilateral system reaches its limits. In particular, it looks at the emergent trends of consortium and multi-stakeholder governance, a trend which we posit started with the foundation of the World Economic Forum and from which has evolved Facebook’s Libra Association, a hybrid of consortium and multistakeholder governance.  The Future of the Firm brings together trends in the “gig economy”, innovations in blockchain-based governance and game theory with the constraints on traditional shareholder capitalism to explain what the future of work and the firm ultimately looks.

"459",1028,2020-01-12,"Brave New Coin","With the announcement of the proposed Libra digital currency in 2019, even skeptical officials were forced to accept that crypto assets are here to stay. Stablecoins are seen as a priority for 2020, with national and global regulators publishing a variety of stablecoin research across the last 12 months.  This article looks at the global regulatory landscape and identifies the key regulatory bodies. Who are they and what is their current position regarding stablecoins?  Structural Changes  In her debut speech as the ECB President at the European Banking Conference in Frankfurt in November, Christine Lagarde spoke of the structural changes happening in the global economy, alluding to blockchain and emerging technologies:  “World trade is being reordered as new technologies disrupt conventional supply chains and workplace organization” - Christine Lagarde, ECB President  Lagarde added, “Ongoing trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties are contributing to a slowdown in world trade growth, which has more than halved since last year. This has in turn depressed global growth to its lowest level since the great financial crisis.”  Later, in December, Ms. Lagarde acknowledged stablecoins as an area of focus for her tenure, addressing them in a message that also covered global issues such as climate change. “There is clearly demand out there that we have to respond to,” and the ECB, “should stay ahead of the curve,” she said. This has elevated the status of cryptocurrency to a global priority for the ECB in 2020.  The ECB has also created a proof-of-concept DLT platform, called EUROchain, for bank intermediaries that have access to central bank accounts and can draw on reserve balances held at the central bank to provide central bank digital currency their customers.  The G20 agenda  Crypto assets also made the agenda of the G20 summit held in Osaka, Japan in June 2019. In their declaration, leaders of the G20 group of nations acknowledged the benefits that blockchain technology could deliver to the global financial system and the broader economy. They reiterated that crypto assets do not pose a threat to global financial stability at this point. However, they recommend close monitoring of cryptocurrency developments and ongoing monitoring of the underlying risks.  Later in the year, in October, the Financial Stability Board, which is chaired by the G20, sent a more urgent  to G20 leaders about the potential threat to stability from ‘global stablecoins.’ This letter came after the announcement of Facebook’s proposed Libra stablecoin and acknowledged that ‘GSCs’ could become systemically important and eventually even substitutes for domestic currency.    As many stablecoins use the same mechanics as real-world currencies such as a currency board, currency basket, dollar pegs, and even open market operations, they are subject to the same risks as legacy currencies and potentially the same regulations as well. With stablecoins, agents such as designated market-makers may have significant market power and the ability to determine the stablecoin price. This leaves open the potential for market manipulation.  Meanwhile, the ‘oracle problem’ in decentralized systems is yet to be resolved. This dilemma describes the reliance on a third-party for price feeds to maintain the price of the stablecoin to an external peg. Late last year, the Synthetix stablecoin SUSD suffered  from a trading bot which exploited the oracle price feeds, issuing more debt than there was collateral and brought the stablecoin close to insolvency.  The term ‘global stablecoins’ has emerged among regulators to describe digital currencies such as Libra, which are not decentralized but have the potential to gain widespread adoption. A G7/Bank of International Settlements report on stablecoins concluded, “GSCs could have significant adverse effects, both domestically and internationally, on the transmission of monetary policy, as well as financial stability, in addition to cross-jurisdictional efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.”  Meanwhile, the Chinese government appeared to change its tune on blockchain with an official announcement that China would embrace the technology as a core strategic pillar of its future economy. In October, China’s President Xi Jinping gave a major speech stating that the country needed to make a greater effort with blockchain_ _“to get an edge on other major countries.”  2019 timeline of regulator statements and publications  June:  - The FATF Recommendations are recognized as the global anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT) standard. It updated its framework on “Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASPs) to be regulated for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) purposes, licensed or registered, and subject to effective systems for monitoring or supervision.”  August:  - The ECB published a rare technical whitepaper on stablecoins, summating that “initiatives with a clear governance framework may nevertheless be hampered by the uncertainty relating to the lack of regulatory scrutiny and recognition.”  October:  - In a letter to G20 leaders, FSB Chairman Randal K. Quarles wrote “the introduction of ‘global stablecoins’ could pose a host of challenges to the regulatory community, not least because they have the potential to become systemically important, including through the substitution of domestic currencies.”  October:  - A co-authored working group paper on stablecoins declared “Some risks are amplified and new risks might arise following global adoption. Stablecoin initiatives built on an existing – large and/or cross-border – customer base may have the potential to scale rapidly. These are referred to as “global stablecoins” (GSCs).  November:  - FinCEN Director Kenneth A. Blanco spoke at a Chainalysis Blockchain Symposium saying “accepting and transmitting activity denominated in stablecoins makes you a money transmitter under the BSA (Bank Secrecy Act). It does not matter if the stablecoin is backed by a currency, a commodity, or even an algorithm — the rules are the same. To that point, administrators of stablecoins have to register as MSBs with FinCEN.”  November:  - “Stablecoin initiatives that are built on existing large and cross-border customer networks, such as Facebook’s Libra, have the potential to rapidly achieve widespread adoption. These initiatives are referred to as “global stablecoins, but if poorly designed and unregulated, could negatively affect financial stability.”"
"460",716,2020-01-10,"Brave New Coin","Ethereum celebrated New Year's Day with a last-minute network upgrade, Muir Glacier, which is designed to delay the onset of the ‘Ice Age'  The upgrade, named after the melting Alaskan natural wonder, patches a mistake made in the Istanbul update of December 2019. When Istanbul was put in place, Ethereum developers apparently forgot to adjust the feature known as the 'difficulty bomb'. This slows down block settlement to gradually push the network towards a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.  According to critics such as Bitcoin maximalist , the developer's forgetfulness caused a significant mishap, creating ""an unplanned reduction"" of twenty percent in inflation rate and security on the Ethereum network.  Nevertheless, the error was addressed with the mining of block number 9,200,000 on January 1st. And now that it is complete, Ethereum's 'Ice Age' is delayed by 4 million blocks (around 611 days), giving developers plenty of time to arrange the eventual transition to proof-of-stake and Ethereum 2.0.  'Ice Age' postponed  The hard fork contained a single Ethereum Improvement Plan——that is best understood by looking back to the beginnings of Ethereum.  Back in early 2014, Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum co-founders planned to create a network that would run on proof-of-stake, as shown by a  from the time in which launch guru Vinay Gupta praised the consensus algorithm for its environmental benefits.  Nevertheless, the network still adopted proof-of-work to start off with and laid out a roadmap for a gradual transition to proof-of-stake that would rely on frequent upgrades to the blockchain.  To help prevent developers from avoiding these updates, which are expensive and cumbersome as they require every single node to upgrade, the developers created a controversial mechanism: the difficulty bomb.  The difficulty bomb was first introduced to the network in the  update of March 2016 and is designed to make the puzzles used to mine Ethereum blocks more difficult over time until eventually they are so difficult to solve it causes delays on the network. In this way, miners will be gradually incentivized to transition to a more sustainable network, before an 'Ice Age' is ushered in and they are forced to switch because mining has become unprofitable.  Unfortunately, the snippet of code that controls this mechanism wasn't updated during the Istanbul hard fork. And without a quick fix, the cost of transactions on the current Ethereum network could have skyrocketed as block settlement times got longer and longer.  A long fuse  Since inception, the difficulty bomb has attracted criticism. A group of heretical developers suggests its impact on the network is not only impossible to predict but potentially dangerous. Now the mechanism is back in the spotlight, its critics are re-energized, and have attacked Ethereum with renewed vigor.  As ever, Bitcoin maximalists are the most vocal critics. Adamant Capital's  draws a political comparison; suggesting the mining difficulty bomb is akin to a gradual transition to enforced communism. ""Communism destroys property rights and thereby the means of production in an economy. The difficulty bomb does the same by removing the economic incentive to mine ETH and thus removes the protection of the network,"" tweeted Demeester.  Bitcoin developer Udi Wertheimer blames Ethereum developers for the unfortunate choice of a new year holiday for the upgrade date. And in a more cutting remark, he suggests the 'Ice Age' has become a political tool for Ethereum developers ""to gain support for whatever changes they push.""  Indeed, if the mining difficulty bomb can be perpetually delayed, then it loses its ability to act as a threat—just like a bomb with an infinitely long fuse, or as Tuur Demeester put it, ""like contracts written with pre-boiled spaghetti.""  Nevertheless, now that the threat of detonating the mining bomb is out the way, the groundwork is set for the next phase of Ethereum's development. Beacon Chain, which represents the first major structural shift of the Serenity upgrade, is scheduled for the early part of 2020. This is set to be followed by the highly-anticipated  upgrade, which promises to hold the keys to the future scalability of Ethereum."
"461",751,2019-12-07,"Brave New Coin","Studies on the environmental impact of Bitcoin have been polarizing - suggesting that mining is either a catastrophic waste of energy or of no concern at all. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle.  The truth, according to a new  from researchers at Aalborg University in Denmark, is somewhere in the middle. By conducting a cradle-to-grave analysis of Bitcoin mining, Susanne Köhler and Massimo Pizzol claim to have arrived at a clearer picture of the total environmental impact of Bitcoin mining.  Considering all stages of the process — from the extraction of raw materials and the manufacture of mining equipment to the solving of the complex mathematical puzzles that proof-of-work demands — Köhler and Pizzol found the Bitcoin network consumed 31.3 Terawatt-hours of electricity, and generated 17.3 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018.  These figures are lower than previous estimates that have been  the network for consuming more electricity than many small countries.  Flawed assumptions  A study led by  at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in June estimated that annual carbon dioxide emissions from the Bitcoin network were as high as 22.9 million metric tons — a similar amount of pollution to that produced by Jordan.  The new study from the University of Ahlborg suggests this conclusion could be false, as it is based on flawed assumptions about the origins of electricity used for mining Bitcoin in China.  Breaking down mining into the different regions of China shows that the contribution of miners in Inner Mongolia, which relies heavily on fossil fuels like coal to generate its electricity, has been overstated, as the area is home to only around 12 percent of Bitcoin miners.  The highest concentration of Bitcoin miners, a total of 30 percent, is thought to be operating in Sichuan, the Southwestern province of China that has a protracted rainy season which supplies plentiful cheap electricity from hydropower. Sichuan’s contribution to Bitcoin mining’s CO2 emissions is minimal but may have been conflated in previous studies with mining undertaken with electricity from fossil fuels in regions like Inner Mongolia.  Such mistakes are easy to make, as although it is easy to determine the sources of electricity used in any particular location, it is not so easy to track miners, who have no incentive to publicly report their location.  ""Most miners belong to a mining pool,"" said Köhler to Brave New Coin. ""While it is possible to figure out where the headquarters of that mining pool is located, it is more difficult to identify the locations of the individual miners. They might join the mining pool from a different country or change mining pools repeatedly.""  A sustainable future for mining  As the number of transactions increases, critics suggest that Bitcoin is only likely to get hungrier, pushing electricity consumption and the associated carbon emissions through the roof.  Köhler's study is optimistic suggesting the number of miners is likely to continue growing, but the environmental impact per miner will shrink as miners pivot towards renewable energy sources, move to colder climates, and adopt more energy-efficient mining equipment.  Speaking to Brave New Coin, Köhler suggests in the long-term, the most competitive mining operations will be ""those that can benefit from hydropower or geothermal energy,"" and take advantage of improvements in battery technology to maintain a steady flow of power.  The other possibility, which has previously been suggested by experts like Andreas Antonopoulos, is that miners could start building their own renewable energy capacity.  In a  on bitcoin mining, Antonopoulos suggested Bitcoin can be used as a way to store surplus energy from renewable energy sources that would otherwise be wasted. In this way, Bitcoin could actually act as a subsidy to alternative energy projects around the world.  Elsewhere, other Bitcoin mining plants are already incorporating their own energy sources. In  mining firm Layer1 is building a facility consisting of wind-powered Bitcoin mining rigs.  Other schemes promise to change mining on a more fundamental level. Researchers at  plan to use silicon photonics to fix the fundamental issue of computational expense and enable more energy-efficient mining.  While this has yet to be put into production, the ability of new hardware to create seismic shifts in the mining industry has already been demonstrated in 2011 with the arrival of ASICs."
"462",3442,2019-07-05,"Brave New Coin","The first half of 2019 has been a key transitional period for the NEM blockchain and the XEM token. The digital currency’s price gains over the last six months have coincided with a rework of the ecosystem’s inefficient governance structure and speculation surrounding a new underlying blockchain for XEM called Catapult, which is set to launch later this year.   is a cryptocurrency network with an original codebase that was launched in March 2015. It is a platform blockchain that uses the ‘proof-of-importance’ consensus algorithm to securely confirm transactions. NEM has a number of other unique blockchain features designed to help the project stand out against competitors such as Ethereum and EOS.  The networks native token, XEM, is used to pay for network transaction fees, for staking on key network governance decisions, and it has utility within the ecosystem for value transfers and payments. Since hitting an apparent bear market bottom on February 6th, the price of the token has bounced ~156% and is currently trading at ~USD.0.09. At present, NEM occupies the 20th position on Brave New Coin’s market cap table.  Mapping the NEM ecosystem  The complex  ecosystem includes more than a blockchain and development team. There are a number of different entities in the ecosystem, and there has occasionally been confusion about the different roles and responsibilities they have.    The above diagram gives a top-level overview of the key components of the NEM blockchain ecosystem. NIS1 refers to the current NEM public blockchain. This will soon be replaced by version 2, ‘’, which will add several new features and aim to improve the efficiency of the network.  Entities like the NEM Foundation, , and NEM Studios support adoption and user growth (network effects) through funding new NEM-centric projects and setting up bounty program designed to ease the transition for Dapps to deploy on the network.  The  was created in 2016, ~2 years after the public chain was launched. It is funded by one of the reserved pools. It is a company limited by guarantee in Singapore. Its focus is on building NEM brand awareness, marketing, training, and partnerships.  NEM Ventures, a more recent addition to the ecosystem, was proposed in August 2018, mandated by the community in September 2018, and incorporated formally by December 2018 in Gibraltar. The entity is mandated by the community to improve the management of Community Funds. 300 million XEM was allocated to the fund during NEM’s ‘Nemesis’ (Genesis) block in 2015.  Previously, the NEM community fund were managed by a grant system run by volunteers, this has transitioned to a structured blockchain venture capital firm that operates much like a traditional VC partner.  The NEM Ventures fund currently contains , which equates to ~USD 25.6 million. The value of the fund is affected by the strong volatility of the XEM token, and the wider crypto asset market. To manage these fluctuations, USD 10 million worth of XEM is always maintained by the fund. Investments into new projects are made using XEM and fiat. Depending on the success of individual NEM venture investments, the program may extend the reach and adoption of the XEM ecosystem.  Recently funded projects include a ~USD 500,000 investment in  in March 2019 and investments into ride sharing service  and , a machine-learning smart meter company aiming to reduce environmental footprint using blockchain and behavioural economics. Vimba is a financial services company based out of New Zealand that offers multiple products including a regular monthly crypto savings model that allows customers to automatically save fiat currency from a bank account and have the savings sent as cryptocurrency to their wallet.  Underlying the NEM Foundation and NEM Studios entities is the not-for-profit company, NEM Holdings.NEM Foundation is separate to this group structure.  NEM’s complex organizational structure has occasionally confused its community and even created concerns surrounding the transparency and state of the NEM treasury funds. On January 1st 2019, the NEM secretariat office released a  informing the community that the NEM Foundation was running low on both XEM and fiat funds following the challenging 2018 crypto winter. The NEM representative, describing the historic business operations of the foundation, stated,  _“We saw efforts being duplicated, and inconsistent metrics of success. We saw very little accountability for funds and questionable ROI, leading to a burn rate of 9 million XEM per month. In terms of running an effective organization, the existing structure failed.” _  The statement announced that the NEM Foundation would continue, but with a new senior management team who would make significant changes to operations.  The new NEM Foundation team promises more tangible investment returns for XEM holders, less extravagant XEM spending (burning) by the foundation, more transparency, and a greater focus on core goals like growing the enterprise adoption of NEM as a blockchain solution.  The statement endorsed the release of the NEM 2.0 blockchain, Catapult, as being a key catalyst for the reinvention of the NEM ecosystem. Catapult adds a number of new transaction and usability features designed to expand the relevance and market appeal of NEM.  Outside of external market-related price action, the NEM ecosystem has clearly gone through a period of internal governance related turmoil over the last 6-12 months. However, this appears to have been resolved. The newly structured NEM Foundation and the upcoming launch of Catapult does create positive fundamental market signals and may reinvigorate new buying pressure for XEM.  Underlying Blockchain solution  Since the announcement of the newly reorganized NEM Foundation on January 31st, the price of XEM has risen by ~100% suggesting bulls may be front running the release of Catapult and the new operational robustness of the NEM governance model.  The NEM code base is completely novel, written in Java. Catapult is written in C++, in addition there a SDK/APIs for numerous languages including JavaScript among others, there is also a REST API that can be used from any modern language  It uses an original consensus algorithm called proof-of-importance (PoI), which allocates block rewards to nodes based on stake, as well as the number and quality of transactions, and how long the stake has been vested for.  The genesis block of NEM generated all 9 billion tokens which will make up XEM's entire possible total supply. XEM has never been 'mined', all rewards for creating blocks are earned through transaction fees. The nature of this reduced economic incentive means the NEM blockchain operates with a small faction of 486 'supernodes'. 3 million XEM is required to host a supernode  [      In order to become a 'harvester' (a NEM block producer), a user must accumulate an importance score. In order to be assigned an importance score, a NEM user must have at least 10,000 XEM vested in a NEM wallet.  XEM becomes 'vested' once it has spent a certain amount of time in a NEM wallet, this is dependent on the amount of NEM vested. Once the vesting point is hit, a user can start creating blocks. A one-time fee is paid to start up, with the blockchain setting limits for difficulty and rewards fluctuating around a 5% level.  While vesting makes up some portion of a node’s importance score, another influential factor is transaction activity. At a reducing rate, users are given greater importance based on how often they send XEM between unique accounts.    _NEM current network statistics, source: stakingrewards.com. These numbers suggest the 10,000 minimum stake required to operate a NEM delegated harvesting earns ~420 XEM yearly, equivalent to ~$39. Stakingrewards, based on ROI, stability, and frequency, rates NEM’s reward rate as ‘moderate’. _  The distribution to supernodes is roughly 300 XEM a day historically but tends to fluctuate within a bound of about 20-30 XEM each side. The amount paid out is calculated as 140,000 XEM/number of supernodes. The payments are completed on a daily basis.  The system proposes to have a number of advantages over traditional blockchain consensus models. Greater influence is given to users who have been long term participants and those who are actively using NEM. This is opposed to PoS, where influence is generally weighted towards the richest in the network. Proof-of-importance and node reputation is also complimented with the complex Eigen-trust protocol.  PoI is potentially gameable. For example, it is possible the importance score could be boosted by a potential discretely sending and receiving tokens to itself (different addresses) in an attempt to increase the chances of claiming future block rewards in the form of collected transaction fees or other subsidies. However, the NEM blockchain has shown historic resilience and NIS1 has not had any major failures.  Opportunities to game this system are sanctioned. An individual may control multiple accounts and continuously resend XEM between them but the NEM proof-of-importance score reduces with activity like transaction spamming and hoarding.  NEM Namespaces are like accounts and currently use a domain naming system similar to the internet's centralized ICANN domain name system. Within Namespaces, there are higher level domains and subdomains, allowing one entity with one domain to create many different subdomains for different projects or outside business accounts. Smart Assets, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 protocol, allows users to create mosaics that can represent any asset. Mosaics are attached to the Namespaces that they are created and for example, a mosaic can go dead if the Namespace it is attached to does not renew itself.  There is a fee of 100 XEM to establish or renew (yearly) a Namespace for an account in NIS1. As part of Catapult, Namespace creators will be able to choose the renting duration of their Namespace. During the renting period, it will also be possible to extend the rental by sending another register transaction with the extra-confirmed block to rent the Namespace. Mosaics, now detached from Namespaces, have an independent expiration time. Catapult introduces the possibility to create mosaics that never expire, which is not possible in NIS1.    Despite the apparent scaling and cost advantages of other consensus models, Ethereum, a proof-of-work based network, leads other platform blockchains in terms of the number of active addresses. Source: Coinmetrics.io  Catapulting over new fences  Catapult is a yet to be publicly released version of the NEM blockchain engine. It is designed to power the token creation and smart contract requirements for both public and private networks. The protocol will become the new core of the NEM ecosystem and has a number of unique and ambitious features.  New features that will be added to the NEM blockchain as part of the Catapult release include; an aggregated transaction model that will power decentralized swaps and multi-asset escrowed transactions, and a new multi-level, nested multi-signature account model (“AND/OR” logic added to multi-signature accounts) which has potential utility for fraud detection and account recovery.    NEM is often characterized as a blockchain for ‘enterprise’. Catapult is designed to support multiple layers and businesses dealing with NEM by not forcing them to deal with a potentially foreign blockchain layer.  NEM’s blockchain can be accessed by clients using a powerful API interface. This is designed to provide an output that can be used with any programming language, not a specific ‘smart contract’ language. NEM’s API layer and software developer kit is designed to allow developers to build more easily on top of NEM as compared to other platform blockchains.  In late June 2019, a new ecosystem entity NEM Studios was as a dedicated strategy and back end development unit to support the ongoing development of Catapult, in preparation for its release later this year.  The NEM ecosystem’s use of NEM Ventures and NEM Studios to aggressively pursue and develop external projects is in contrast to the more ‘open source’, ‘build it and they will come’ philosophy of most other open-source blockchains. The strategy is likely designed to help bootstrap the initial growth and adoption of Catapult by enterprises.  Objective on-chain indicators  NVT Signal  Derived from the NVT ratio, the NVT signal is a responsive blockchain valuation metric developed by Willy Woo and Dmitry Kalichkin.  Crypto markets are prone to bubbles of speculative purchasing that don’t reflect underlying network fundamentals. The NVT signal (or 90 day adjusted NVT) provides insight into what stage of this price cycle a token may be at.  A high NVT signal is indicative of a network that is going through one of these bubble periods and may move towards a position of becoming overbought/overvalued, as the market's speculative momentum slows. Note that these assessments are made based on NIS1 data and on-chain patterns are likely to recalibrate following the launch of Catapult.    Short term fundamental indicators given by XEM’s NVT signal lean bullish. At the end of 2018, there was a sharp drop in NVTS from around 420 points to around 70 points, which suggested that the token had run out of speculative fuel to create new buying pressure and was readjusting from a point of being overvalued. The drop coincided with a period of stagnating price activity.  Since May 2019 however, XEM’s NVTS has begun steadily rising along with price suggesting that there has been a trend reversal and a new bubble of speculative buying pressure may be building. XEM’s NVTS currently sits at ~110 points suggesting that there is plenty of room for price and NVTS to grow in the short term before hitting a point of becoming overvalued again.  Factors behind the recent rise in on-chain volume activity may be due to increased interest to trial NIS before the switch to Catapult later in 2019.  PMR  Metcalfe's law is a measure of the connections in a network, as established by Robert Metcalfe, the founder of Ethernet. It has subsequently been used to analyze the true value of network-based financial products like Facebook and Bitcoin. By comparing it to price, it can provide a useful tool to assess whether a token is over or undervalued.  It is also a more straightforward metric to assess when compared to on-chain transaction volume, which can be challenging to measure accurately in USD terms. Addresses are measured as the number of unique sending and receiving addresses participating in transactions daily.    Like NVTS, short term signals sent by XEM’s PMR lean bullish. There has been a sharp fall in the network’s PMR beginning around late 2017, meaning there has been a sharp rise in active addresses versus the market value (market cap) of XEM over the last 18 months or so. This may suggest that NEM is currently undervalued. However, issues with price discovery and noise within the active address metric mean this undervalued implication is not fully robust.  A cryptocurrency’s network effects increase when new users join and strengthen the network, making it more valuable for existing users. The most direct network effects are improved liquidity and utility. More daily active users can be indicative of a higher level of developer adoption to build projects on NEM (more places to spend XEM) and more counterparties willing to accept XEM for payments.  Exchanges and Trading Pairs  The most popular trading option for XEM is BTC with the pair currently handling over 31% of daily trading volumes. The second most popular market is the XEM/ETH pair. Together the top two pairs make up 59% of the daily trading volume. Fiat trading for XEM is most popular in between Japanese Yen and Korean Won pairs suggesting the token has strong liquidity for Asian traders.  The USD value of the daily volume of the entire XEM trading market is ~USD 18 million.    A mix of exchange dominate the XEM trading market places, with 5 different entities operating the top 5 XEM trading pairs. The XEM/ETH market on Kryptono is the most active market in the ecosystem. GRIN is also tradeable on high profile exchanges such as Binance and Bittrex.    Technical Analysis  Over the past month, XEM has been held within a tight consolidation pattern as other mid-cap alts have moved higher. A potential roadmap for upcoming price movements can be found using exponential moving averages (EMAs), volume (VPVR), Pitchforks (PFs), , and Ichimoku Cloud. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found .  On the daily chart, the price found significant bullish momentum in mid June leading to a bullish 50-day EMA and 200-day EMA cross, ending a 455-day bear market. This Golden Cross suggests further bullish upside. The 200-day EMA at US$0.080 should now act as support. There are no active RSI or volume divergences currently.  Further, a bullish consolidation pattern, the flag, has formed suggestive of continuation. Hallmarks of this pattern include a fixed range with horizontal resistance and support. The pattern carries a 1.618 and measured move target of US$0.1317 and US$0.1640, respectively. If successful, this bullish flag should lead to an additional markup phase.    Turning to the Ichimoku Cloud, four metrics are used to indicate if a trend exists; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa.  Cloud metrics on the daily time frame, with doubled settings (20/60/120/30) for more accurate signals, are currently bullish; price is above the Cloud, the Cloud is bullish, the TK cross is bullish, and the Lagging Span is above Cloud and in price. Until May of this year, price had spent over 400 days below the Cloud, which is suggestive of a resounding end to the previous bear market. The current trend will continue to have a bullish bias so long as price remains above Cloud.    Lastly, on the daily XEM/BTC chart, price sits near a multi-year low with all trend indicators pointing to bearish continuation. Price is below the Cloud and both the 50-day and 200-day EMA. There are also no bullish divergences currently, which could suggest bearish exhaustion. Based on historic volume (horizontal bars), there is strong support at 400 sats and below. The trend is likely to remain bearish so long as price remains below the 200-day EMA and the Cloud.    Conclusion  2019 represents a watershed moment for the NEM blockchain and the XEM token. The start of the year heralded major changes to the ecosystem’s governance model and a new operational structure has been put in place. This is designed to correct previous mistakes and bottlenecks. The market appears to have responded well to these changes, and the XEM price gains suggest there may be renewed interest in the project from the crypto trading and investment space.  Much of this turnaround appears to be related to the release of a new underlying blockchain protocol for the ecosystem, Catapult. It is set to launch at some stage late in 2019 (no specific date has been set) and appears to address a number of flaws within NIS1, as well as adding new features such as aggregated transactions and multi-signature account capabilities. With a new, feature-rich, efficient blockchain protocol, NEM appears poised to remain a standout performer in the platform blockchain space.  Technicals for the XEM/USD pair suggest a nascent confirmed bull trend with an active bullish consolidation pattern. This consolidation should resolve over the next month leading to breakout toward the US$0.1317 to US$0.1640 range. Any additional upside in the near term will likely find significant resistance at the psychological level of US$0.20. Technicals for the XEM/BTC pair are heavily bearish with no suggestion of reversal. Buyers will likely return if price breaches below the 400 sat zone or above the 1000 sat zone, the former being more likely in the near term.  *Editorial Disclosure: Brave New Coin's parent company, Techemy Limited holds a quantity of XEM tokens. *"
"463",3442,2019-07-05,"Brave New Coin","The first half of 2019 has been a key transitional period for the NEM blockchain and the XEM token. The digital currency’s price gains over the last six months have coincided with a rework of the ecosystem’s inefficient governance structure and speculation surrounding a new underlying blockchain for XEM called Catapult, which is set to launch later this year.   is a cryptocurrency network with an original codebase that was launched in March 2015. It is a platform blockchain that uses the ‘proof-of-importance’ consensus algorithm to securely confirm transactions. NEM has a number of other unique blockchain features designed to help the project stand out against competitors such as Ethereum and EOS.  The networks native token, XEM, is used to pay for network transaction fees, for staking on key network governance decisions, and it has utility within the ecosystem for value transfers and payments. Since hitting an apparent bear market bottom on February 6th, the price of the token has bounced ~156% and is currently trading at ~USD.0.09. At present, NEM occupies the 20th position on Brave New Coin’s market cap table.  Mapping the NEM ecosystem  The complex  ecosystem includes more than a blockchain and development team. There are a number of different entities in the ecosystem, and there has occasionally been confusion about the different roles and responsibilities they have.    The above diagram gives a top-level overview of the key components of the NEM blockchain ecosystem. NIS1 refers to the current NEM public blockchain. This will soon be replaced by version 2, ‘’, which will add several new features and aim to improve the efficiency of the network.  Entities like the NEM Foundation, , and NEM Studios support adoption and user growth (network effects) through funding new NEM-centric projects and setting up bounty program designed to ease the transition for Dapps to deploy on the network.  The  was created in 2016, ~2 years after the public chain was launched. It is funded by one of the reserved pools. It is a company limited by guarantee in Singapore. Its focus is on building NEM brand awareness, marketing, training, and partnerships.  NEM Ventures, a more recent addition to the ecosystem, was proposed in August 2018, mandated by the community in September 2018, and incorporated formally by December 2018 in Gibraltar. The entity is mandated by the community to improve the management of Community Funds. 300 million XEM was allocated to the fund during NEM’s ‘Nemesis’ (Genesis) block in 2015.  Previously, the NEM community fund were managed by a grant system run by volunteers, this has transitioned to a structured blockchain venture capital firm that operates much like a traditional VC partner.  The NEM Ventures fund currently contains , which equates to ~USD 25.6 million. The value of the fund is affected by the strong volatility of the XEM token, and the wider crypto asset market. To manage these fluctuations, USD 10 million worth of XEM is always maintained by the fund. Investments into new projects are made using XEM and fiat. Depending on the success of individual NEM venture investments, the program may extend the reach and adoption of the XEM ecosystem.  Recently funded projects include a ~USD 500,000 investment in  in March 2019 and investments into ride sharing service  and , a machine-learning smart meter company aiming to reduce environmental footprint using blockchain and behavioural economics. Vimba is a financial services company based out of New Zealand that offers multiple products including a regular monthly crypto savings model that allows customers to automatically save fiat currency from a bank account and have the savings sent as cryptocurrency to their wallet.  Underlying the NEM Foundation and NEM Studios entities is the not-for-profit company, NEM Holdings.NEM Foundation is separate to this group structure.  NEM’s complex organizational structure has occasionally confused its community and even created concerns surrounding the transparency and state of the NEM treasury funds. On January 1st 2019, the NEM secretariat office released a  informing the community that the NEM Foundation was running low on both XEM and fiat funds following the challenging 2018 crypto winter. The NEM representative, describing the historic business operations of the foundation, stated,  “We saw efforts being duplicated, and inconsistent metrics of success. We saw very little accountability for funds and questionable ROI, leading to a burn rate of 9 million XEM per month. In terms of running an effective organization, the existing structure failed.”  The statement announced that the NEM Foundation would continue, but with a new senior management team who would make significant changes to operations.  The new NEM Foundation team promises more tangible investment returns for XEM holders, less extravagant XEM spending (burning) by the foundation, more transparency, and a greater focus on core goals like growing the enterprise adoption of NEM as a blockchain solution.  The statement endorsed the release of the NEM 2.0 blockchain, Catapult, as being a key catalyst for the reinvention of the NEM ecosystem. Catapult adds a number of new transaction and usability features designed to expand the relevance and market appeal of NEM.  Outside of external market-related price action, the NEM ecosystem has clearly gone through a period of internal governance related turmoil over the last 6-12 months. However, this appears to have been resolved. The newly structured NEM Foundation and the upcoming launch of Catapult does create positive fundamental market signals and may reinvigorate new buying pressure for XEM.  Underlying Blockchain solution  Since the announcement of the newly reorganized NEM Foundation on January 31st, the price of XEM has risen by ~100% suggesting bulls may be front running the release of Catapult and the new operational robustness of the NEM governance model.  The NEM code base is completely novel, written in Java. Catapult is written in C++, in addition there a SDK/APIs for numerous languages including JavaScript among others, there is also a REST API that can be used from any modern language  It uses an original consensus algorithm called proof-of-importance (PoI), which allocates block rewards to nodes based on stake, as well as the number and quality of transactions, and how long the stake has been vested for.  The genesis block of NEM generated all 9 billion tokens which will make up XEM's entire possible total supply. XEM has never been 'mined', all rewards for creating blocks are earned through transaction fees. The nature of this reduced economic incentive means the NEM blockchain operates with a small faction of 486 'supernodes'. 3 million XEM is required to host a supernode  [      In order to become a 'harvester' (a NEM block producer), a user must accumulate an importance score. In order to be assigned an importance score, a NEM user must have at least 10,000 XEM vested in a NEM wallet.  XEM becomes 'vested' once it has spent a certain amount of time in a NEM wallet, this is dependent on the amount of NEM vested. Once the vesting point is hit, a user can start creating blocks. A one-time fee is paid to start up, with the blockchain setting limits for difficulty and rewards fluctuating around a 5% level.  While vesting makes up some portion of a node’s importance score, another influential factor is transaction activity. At a reducing rate, users are given greater importance based on how often they send XEM between unique accounts.    _NEM current network statistics, source: stakingrewards.com. These numbers suggest the 10,000 minimum stake required to operate a NEM delegated harvesting earns ~420 XEM yearly, equivalent to ~$39. Stakingrewards, based on ROI, stability, and frequency, rates NEM’s reward rate as ‘moderate’. _  The distribution to supernodes is roughly 300 XEM a day historically but tends to fluctuate within a bound of about 20-30 XEM each side. The amount paid out is calculated as 140,000 XEM/number of supernodes. The payments are completed on a daily basis.  The system proposes to have a number of advantages over traditional blockchain consensus models. Greater influence is given to users who have been long term participants and those who are actively using NEM. This is opposed to PoS, where influence is generally weighted towards the richest in the network. Proof-of-importance and node reputation is also complimented with the complex Eigen-trust protocol.  PoI is potentially gameable. For example, it is possible the importance score could be boosted by a potential discretely sending and receiving tokens to itself (different addresses) in an attempt to increase the chances of claiming future block rewards in the form of collected transaction fees or other subsidies. However, the NEM blockchain has shown historic resilience and NIS1 has not had any major failures.  Opportunities to game this system are sanctioned. An individual may control multiple accounts and continuously resend XEM between them but the NEM proof-of-importance score reduces with activity like transaction spamming and hoarding.  NEM Namespaces are like accounts and currently use a domain naming system similar to the internet's centralized ICANN domain name system. Within Namespaces, there are higher level domains and subdomains, allowing one entity with one domain to create many different subdomains for different projects or outside business accounts. Smart Assets, similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 protocol, allows users to create mosaics that can represent any asset. Mosaics are attached to the Namespaces that they are created and for example, a mosaic can go dead if the Namespace it is attached to does not renew itself.  There is a fee of 100 XEM to establish or renew (yearly) a Namespace for an account in NIS1. As part of Catapult, Namespace creators will be able to choose the renting duration of their Namespace. During the renting period, it will also be possible to extend the rental by sending another register transaction with the extra-confirmed block to rent the Namespace. Mosaics, now detached from Namespaces, have an independent expiration time. Catapult introduces the possibility to create mosaics that never expire, which is not possible in NIS1.    Despite the apparent scaling and cost advantages of other consensus models, Ethereum, a proof-of-work based network, leads other platform blockchains in terms of the number of active addresses. Source: Coinmetrics.io  Catapulting over new fences  Catapult is a yet to be publicly released version of the NEM blockchain engine. It is designed to power the token creation and smart contract requirements for both public and private networks. The protocol will become the new core of the NEM ecosystem and has a number of unique and ambitious features.  New features that will be added to the NEM blockchain as part of the Catapult release include; an aggregated transaction model that will power decentralized swaps and multi-asset escrowed transactions, and a new multi-level, nested multi-signature account model (“AND/OR” logic added to multi-signature accounts) which has potential utility for fraud detection and account recovery.    NEM is often characterized as a blockchain for ‘enterprise’. Catapult is designed to support multiple layers and businesses dealing with NEM by not forcing them to deal with a potentially foreign blockchain layer.  NEM’s blockchain can be accessed by clients using a powerful API interface. This is designed to provide an output that can be used with any programming language, not a specific ‘smart contract’ language. NEM’s API layer and software developer kit is designed to allow developers to build more easily on top of NEM as compared to other platform blockchains.  In late June 2019, a new ecosystem entity NEM Studios was as a dedicated strategy and back end development unit to support the ongoing development of Catapult, in preparation for its release later this year.  The NEM ecosystem’s use of NEM Ventures and NEM Studios to aggressively pursue and develop external projects is in contrast to the more ‘open source’, ‘build it and they will come’ philosophy of most other open-source blockchains. The strategy is likely designed to help bootstrap the initial growth and adoption of Catapult by enterprises.  Objective on-chain indicators  NVT Signal  Derived from the NVT ratio, the NVT signal is a responsive blockchain valuation metric developed by Willy Woo and Dmitry Kalichkin.  Crypto markets are prone to bubbles of speculative purchasing that don’t reflect underlying network fundamentals. The NVT signal (or 90 day adjusted NVT) provides insight into what stage of this price cycle a token may be at.  A high NVT signal is indicative of a network that is going through one of these bubble periods and may move towards a position of becoming overbought/overvalued, as the market's speculative momentum slows. Note that these assessments are made based on NIS1 data and on-chain patterns are likely to recalibrate following the launch of Catapult.    Short term fundamental indicators given by XEM’s NVT signal lean bullish. At the end of 2018, there was a sharp drop in NVTS from around 420 points to around 70 points, which suggested that the token had run out of speculative fuel to create new buying pressure and was readjusting from a point of being overvalued. The drop coincided with a period of stagnating price activity.  Since May 2019 however, XEM’s NVTS has begun steadily rising along with price suggesting that there has been a trend reversal and a new bubble of speculative buying pressure may be building. XEM’s NVTS currently sits at ~110 points suggesting that there is plenty of room for price and NVTS to grow in the short term before hitting a point of becoming overvalued again.  Factors behind the recent rise in on-chain volume activity may be due to increased interest to trial NIS before the switch to Catapult later in 2019.  PMR  Metcalfe's law is a measure of the connections in a network, as established by Robert Metcalfe, the founder of Ethernet. It has subsequently been used to analyze the true value of network-based financial products like Facebook and Bitcoin. By comparing it to price, it can provide a useful tool to assess whether a token is over or undervalued.  It is also a more straightforward metric to assess when compared to on-chain transaction volume, which can be challenging to measure accurately in USD terms. Addresses are measured as the number of unique sending and receiving addresses participating in transactions daily.    Like NVTS, short term signals sent by XEM’s PMR lean bullish. There has been a sharp fall in the network’s PMR beginning around late 2017, meaning there has been a sharp rise in active addresses versus the market value (market cap) of XEM over the last 18 months or so. This may suggest that NEM is currently undervalued. However, issues with price discovery and noise within the active address metric mean this undervalued implication is not fully robust.  A cryptocurrency’s network effects increase when new users join and strengthen the network, making it more valuable for existing users. The most direct network effects are improved liquidity and utility. More daily active users can be indicative of a higher level of developer adoption to build projects on NEM (more places to spend XEM) and more counterparties willing to accept XEM for payments.  Exchanges and Trading Pairs  The most popular trading option for XEM is BTC with the pair currently handling over 31% of daily trading volumes. The second most popular market is the XEM/ETH pair. Together the top two pairs make up 59% of the daily trading volume. Fiat trading for XEM is most popular in between Japanese Yen and Korean Won pairs suggesting the token has strong liquidity for Asian traders.  The USD value of the daily volume of the entire XEM trading market is ~USD 18 million.    A mix of exchange dominate the XEM trading market places, with 5 different entities operating the top 5 XEM trading pairs. The XEM/ETH market on Kryptono is the most active market in the ecosystem. GRIN is also tradeable on high profile exchanges such as Binance and Bittrex.

"468",986,2019-06-17,"Brave New Coin","A report by CoinShares is providing new insight into the state of the bitcoin mining industry. Among one of the most interesting findings in the paper is that the global bitcoin mining sector is largely environmentally friendly due to the widespread use of renewable energy.  This finding contradicts many prior reports and should help to alter the ‘Bitcoin is an environmental disaster’ narrative. The biannual ‘Bitcoin Mining Network’  was compiled by CoinShares researchers Christopher Bendiksen and Samuel Gibbons. It covers areas such as overall cryptocurrency mining trends, the average costs of operation per area, the types of energy used to power mining rigs as well as the general composition of miners across the world. This is the third iteration of the report.  Global Advisors-owned  is a London-based digital asset investment and research company that is most known for its offering of exchange-traded crypto asset investment products, such as the Bitcoin Trackers (COINXBT and COINXBE) and Ether Trackers (COINETH and COINETHE). Most recently, in 2018, for institutional investors  Renewable energy dominates  The mining sector is dominated by miners located in areas where there is cheap hydroelectric energy. Examples of these areas are Scandinavia, the Caucasus, the Pacific North West, Eastern Canada and Southwestern China.  Utilizing a combination of estimated global mining locations as well as regional renewables penetrations, CoinShares found that the bitcoin mining industry is supported heavily by renewable energy.  Christopher Bendiksen, head of research at CoinShares : “Our current approximate percentage of renewable power generation in the Bitcoin mining energy mix stands at 74.1%, more than four times more renewable usage than the global average energy mix.”  This revelation is a win for the bitcoin mining sector which has been heavily criticized in the past for its large energy needs. Additionally, it speaks to a sector that is working to reconcile its ideals with increased global environmental concerns.  Increased transaction fees  The report confirms that bitcoin miners continue to dominate the overall mining sector. Bitcoin proof-of-work miners net greater amounts with regard to both total revenue as well as total security spend.  The report states: “Over the course of 2018, Bitcoin miners received an estimated $5.5bn in total block rewards, $5.2bn (97%) of which was newly minted coins, and $300m (3%) of which were transaction fees. At current (31 May 2019) prices and 30d average fees per block, Bitcoin miners are earning an estimated total annualized return of $6.2bn per year, 94% of which come from new coins and 6% from fees.”  This finding points towards an increase in the fees levied on each transaction within the Bitcoin network. The noted increase in the proportion of returns between block rewards and transaction fees is interesting as well as advantageous for miners because it represents a more mature stream of the transaction market.  The Bitcoin network is designed to cut the number of bitcoins remitted to miners by half at specific intervals. Controlled by the difficulty algorithm, the next block halving is estimated to arrive sometime in the next 12 months. While an expected development in the network, it does represent a significant fall in returns for miners. Thus, the increase in transaction fees is welcome news for the mining community.  Network changes  The CoinShares report also found that there was a pronounced correlation between the hashrate, the bitcoin (BTC) price as well as other macro trends relating to the mining industry related to the two aforementioned factors.  Between November 2018 and June 2019, the hashrate increased around 25% from about 40 EH/s to approximately 50 EH/s. The hashrate experienced a major drop and bottomed out in correlation with the falling bitcoin price. The lowest bitcoin price in recent times was experienced on  2018.  CoinShares notes that “the ~40% drop in hashrate observed at the tail-end of 2018 represents the first time we have ever observed a substantial and prolonged drop in hashrate as a result of sustained large-scale corrections in the bitcoin price.”  As the bitcoin price began to recover and rally in January and beyond, bitcoin miners began returning. Additionally, the rally coincided with the beginning of the rainy season in South-Western China. This is a major factor because the rain is used to create hydroelectric power which is a cheaper source of electricity for Chinese miners. This factor also contributed to the growth of the Bitcoin network’s hashrate.  Moreover, there were two observed macro trends correlated to the shifts in price and hashrate. The first of these is a large number of miners exiting the Bitcoin network due to the fall in price. The reports revealed that a large number of miners experienced bankruptcies and liquidations. In the attempt to recoup some of their funds, some miners resorted to transferring ownership of their mining rigs to other miners. Often the buying miners were those with bigger operations able to withstand the low price pressure.  The second trend is the “first at-scale deployment of the latest generation mining gear.” The report notes that this shift is most visible in the Chinese area of Sichuan. As mentioned earlier this coincides with the rainy season in that area. Despite this, CoinShares found that Chinese dominance as a geographical powerhouse in the mining sector continues to fall, in line with the trend witnessed over recent years.  However, China continues to assert its dominance in the development of mining rigs. The report explains: “Chinese dominance in the hardware manufacturing sector remains as strong as ever and is showing no immediate signs of reduction. Even if the most damning rumors of Bitmain’s struggles were true (we have our doubts), it would have minimal impact on Chinese dominance in the miner manufacturing sector as all other relevant manufacturers are also Chinese.”"
"469",4323,2019-03-28,"Brave New Coin","On-chain transactions per day have continued to show a sustained and significant rise over the past few months, which can mainly be attributed to VeriBlock, a mechanism for securing other blockchains using the BTC blockchain.  Bitcoin () is a decentralized digital currency, created by Satoshi Nakamoto, and released in 2009. Although the coin has remained at the top of the  since then, the spot price is currently down 81% from the all time high set in December 2017. Over the past month, BTC has overperformed Ethereum (), EOS (), Ripple () and Tron () while underperforming Litecoin (), Steller (), and Binance Coin (). The BTC market cap currently stands at US$69.21 billion, with US$4.03 billion traded in the past 24 hours.    Source: coin360.com  Transactions per day declined significantly for most cryptocurrencies throughout 2018. Most of these coins continue to have very few transactions per day relative to 2017. Transactions per day on the BTC network have generally moved higher since April 2018, with a slight decline since the beginning of March (line, chart below). Additionally, the current number of BTC transactions per day is on par with the local high seen in May 2017.  The average BTC transaction value in USD (fill, chart below) has declined as transactions per day have risen. However, transaction values recently began rising again, as transactions per day have begun declining.  Transaction values peaked on the BTC network in mid-December 2017 at nearly US$100,000. A rise in transactions per day with a decline in the average value of those transactions likely signifies more transactions of smaller value being sent through the network.  The rise in on-chain transactions per day has been due in large part to VeriBlock (VBK), which secures other blockchains through the ""Proof of Proof"" (PoP) consensus mechanism. The VBK team includes Maxwell Sanchez, co-inventor of PoP and developer of Curecoin which provides idle computing resources to biomedical research. Investors and advisors include Jeff Garzik, a previous BTC Core dev and head developer of the failed SegWit2x initiative, and Bill Shihara, co-founder and CEO at Bittrex. VBK is set for an Initial Exchange Offering on Bittrex sometime this year.  PoP secures networks by embedding the current state of non-BTC blockchains into the BTC blockchain using the OP_RETURN transaction code. By continually embedding blockchain states into BTC, other blockchains become less vulnerable to 51% attacks. Over the past few months, several coins, including Vertcoin (VTC) and Ethereum Classic (ETC) have been hit by this PoW vulnerability due to declining or consolidating hash rate on their respective networks.  VBK transactions have continued to rise dramatically since the testnet launch in October 2018. The testnet ended on March 4th, and correlates with the decline in transactions per day. During the testnet period, VBK accounted for as much as 40% of transactions on the BTC network. VBK's mainnet launched on March 25th, and currently accounts for 26% of BTC transactions.    Source: coinmetrics.com  Bitcoin days destroyed (BDD) spiked dramatically in December 2018 and surpassed the previous record set in August 2017. BDD has since declined rapidly but remained significantly elevated in January 2019, based on historical data. BDD for the month of March is currently sitting near four year lows, likely signifying a period of accumulation rather than distribution of older coins.  BDD can be used to measure coin velocity over time. For example, if an entity has 10 BTC they received 10 days ago, and then they spend or move the BTC to another address, 100 BTC days have been destroyed. This metric accrues over time and resets any time the coins are moved.  The months with the highest BDD have historically correlated with extreme highs or lows in price as long term holders begin to sell coins on an exchange. A spike in BDD in July 2017 was likely related to the Bitcoin Cash hard fork. However, this should not be seen as a 1:1 correlation. A rise in BDD can also represent custodial providers moving coins between wallets, which is typical of major exchanges or over the counter (OTC) brokers.    Source: oxt.me  The 30-day Kalichkin network value to on-chain transactions ratio (NVT) has continued to rise since January, and is currently at 27 (line, chart below). Kalichkin's NVT does not account for inflation or the use of off-chain transactions, which would decrease the overall NVT ratio. However, NVT remains in the upper-third of the historic range, which paints a bearish picture. While inflection points in NVT can correlate with extreme highs or lows in price, a rising NVT should also be seen as bearish due to decreasing on-chain network utility.  Daily active addresses (DAA) have ranged between 550,000 to 675,000 over the past few months with DAA currently near the top of that range (fill, chart below). On December 30th, 2017, DAA exceeded one million. A large uptick in DAA should be seen as a bullish indicator for price as it suggests an increase in on-chain BTC demand. As off-chain transaction facilities increase, daily active addresses may stagnate or decline.  Further, there continues to be grassroots interest in BTC, as suggested by 1.7 million members and 5,116 meetups worldwide on meetup.com. The BTC subreddit also has over 1 million subscribers and is ranked 166th overall on reddit.com. There are also 434 BTC-related job postings on LinkedIn in the United States, which has increased slightly over the past few weeks.    Source: coinmetrics.com  Turning to mining fundamentals, the network hash rate has increased significantly since December 21st, indicating a substantial increase in mining activity. The increase followed a 35% decrease in difficulty across four difficulty adjustments late last year. Difficulty increased by 10% on December 31st and nearly 5% on January 13th, both increases reflecting the added hashing power. Since then, the network has undergone five difficulty adjustments accounting for an 8.3% increase in difficulty.  Network difficulty adjusts up to +/-25% after 2016 blocks have confirmed. As hash rate decreases before a difficulty adjustment, block times increase. As hash rate increases before a difficulty adjustment, block times decrease. Average block times are currently averaging closer to 9.3 minutes with an estimated 6.23% increase in difficulty projected for the next adjustment in 11 days.  The BTC network is secured with the SHA-256 consensus algorithm. The most profitable SHA-256 ASIC miners currently, at an electricity cost of US$0.06/KWh, are; the ASICminer 8 Nano Pro released in May 2018, the MicroBT Whatsminer M10S released in September 2018, and the Ebang Ebit E11++ and ASICminer 8 Nano 44Th, both released in October 2018. Bitmain's ASIC miners, which once reigned supreme in terms of ASIC profitability, barely make the top 10 list. Network factors that influence mining profitability include; price, block times, difficulty, block reward, and transaction fees. The next block reward halving is currently set for late May 2020.    Source: bitinfocharts.com  The total percentage of overt version-rolling ASICBoost on the network has ranged between 33% and 40% over the past few months, and currently accounts for approximately 35% of all blocks mined. SlushPool mined the first over ASICBoost block on March 24th, 2018 and a Braiins OS mining system verified ASICboost capability on Antminer S9s in October 2018. Bitmain responded by releasing firmware to enable overt ASICboost on the Antminer S9. Overt ASICBoost spiked dramatically after mid-October 2018.  Unlike covert ASICBoost, overt ASICBoost has no detrimental effects on the network while making mining more profitable by requiring less energy usage. Covert ASICBoost encourages small or empty blocks because the mechanism involves transaction reordering. Overt ASICBoost is also SegWit compatible whereas covert ASICboost is not.    Source: asicboost.dance  Despite disruptions in hash rate and increasing block times throughout December 2018, pending transactions have continued to decline, and have been relatively low since mid-November. During the Bitcoin Cash hard fork, pending transactions spiked to almost 40,000 as some miners and mining pools moved hash rate from BTC to Bitcoin Cash.  Since the beginning of the year, any spike in pending transactions has been short lived, having been cleared almost completely within a few hours or days. Recent months have seen pending transactions remain below 10,000 on most days. Throughout 2018, pending transactions remained far below the 200,000-250,000 range seen during the December 2017 trading frenzy.    Source:   The average BTC block size (fill, chart below) has remained far below the block limit of ~2.2MB since March of 2018. Despite an increase in average block size since June, related to VeriBlock transactions, average transactions fees (line, chart below) have not increased substantially and currently average US$0.38. Fees have essentially declined since June 2018, and are currently at pre-February 2017 levels. There has been increasing discussion over the long-term sustainability of network security with the current fee structure, specifically after the block reward runs out in 2100.  A low and non volatile transaction fee market can be partially attributed to the general decline in network use as a whole since December 2017. Additionally, an increase in transaction batching, SegWit use, and off-chain channels like the Lightning Network and Liquid side chains have also contributed to removing network strain and keeping fees low. However, Liquid currently has almost no network traffic.    Source: coinmetrics.io  Transaction Batching involves sending one transaction with many outputs instead of sending each transaction individually. Batching is most effective when used by high transaction volume market participants, such as crypto exchanges and miners, which benefit substantially from the reduced fees. As batching increases, the transactions per day metric underreports the total individual transactions per day.  Transactions with only one output have declined steadily since March 2016 (red, chart below). Over 90% of all transactions are currently sent with at least two outputs. Transactions with three to four outputs have risen substantially since January 2018 (yellow, chart below).    Source:   The overall number of transactions using SegWit recently reached a record high of 47.8%. This metric has risen and fallen directly with the end of VBK testing and the VBK mainnet launch suggesting that VBK does not currently use SegWit transactions. The number of SegWit transactions, as a percentage of total volume, recently accounted for 90% of BTC on-chain volume but has returned to just over 50% of total volume.  SegWit, or BIP141, was activated on August 23rd, 2017 via a user activated soft fork and allows individual transactions to occupy less block space than a traditional transaction. Although both non-SegWit and SegWit transactions can be sent over the network, SegWit users pay less in accumulated fees to achieve the same number of transactions. SegWit also allows for an effective blocksize limit above 2MB. As fees on non-SegWit transactions have declined significantly, users may feel less inclined to use SegWit addresses.    Source:   SegWit also enabled the possibility of further second layer network utilities like the Lightning Network (LN), which facilitates trusted, bidirectional, off-chain, hub and spoke payment channels. The LN also paves the way for the possibility of instant payments, micro and nano-transactions, and increased network scalability.  Since going live on March 15, 2018, the LN has continued to rapidly gain traction. There are now over 37,600 available channels, with a total channel value of 805 BTC. The channels work much like a tab at a restaurant, which remain open until the client settles the bill. This format allows for numerous transactions to occur with one on-chain network fee when the channel is closed. Transactions sizes are currently capped at ~0.04BTC while the network is still being developed and built.  On January 19th, a community member named Hodlonaut started an experiment to send payments through the LN, which has become known as the LN Trust Chain. A random stranger was initially sent 100,000 satoshis and the transaction has now been  to over 250 unique users in 39 countries. Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Twitter and Square and investor in Lightning Labs, received the relay on February 4th and has continued to discuss the importance of Bitcoin and LN on Twitter, including a recent announcement that Square will be hiring up to five Bitcoin developers. Dorsey has also hinted at one day including LN transactions on Twitter natively. The LN trust transaction was also sent through the Blockstream satellite in Earth's orbit.  A new tipping service on Twitter using LN has been growing in popularity. Tippin.Me is similar to the previous on-chain version ChangeTip and allows users to send microtransactions on the LN with a few clicks. The service became so popular so quickly that it initially encountered server trouble trying to keep up with demand. Another LN based service went live earlier this year. Ln.pizza allows U.S. users to instantly purchase Domino's pizza with a 5% discount by using the LN.    Source:   Turning to developer activity, Bitcoin Core released version 0.17.1 on December 25th with various bug fixes and performance improvements. Version 0.18.0 is set for release on April 3rd, 2018. The BTC project on GitHub has two active repos ""bitcoin"" and ""BIPs"" or Bitcoin Improvement Protocols. Over 170 developers have contributed over 3,200 commits to over the past year, mostly on the bitcoin repo (shown below).  Most coins use the developer community of GitHub where files are saved in folders called ""repositories,"" or ""repos,"" and changes to these files are recorded with ""commits,"" which save a record of what changes were made, when, and by who. Although commits represent quantity and not necessarily quality, a higher number of commits can signify higher dev activity and interest.  Future potential protocol improvements in the pipeline include Schnorr signatures, Taproot, and Graftroot. Schnorr signatures and signature aggregation also bring the potential for storage and bandwidth reduction by at least 25%. Taproot and Graftroot improve upon Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) which offers three benefits; smaller transactions, more privacy, and larger smart contracts.    Source:   BTC exchange traded volume over the past 24 hours has been dominated by Tether () trading, with the United States Dollar (USD) markets representing just 15% of total volume. The exchanges with the highest reported volume over the past 24 hours include OEX, Bitforex, and CoinBene. Stable coin volumes, which have grown to account for 50% of trades in recent weeks, currently represent ~73% of all BTC volume over the past 24 hours.  In Asia, volume on the Japanese Yen (JPY), Korean Won (KRW), Chinese Yen (CNY) pairs have remained subdued throughout the past few years, and currently account for 3.7% of global volume. The BTC/CNY pair currently holds an 11% premium over the BTC/USD pair. The so-called Kimchi premium on the BTC/KRW pair, which existed during the bull market, has vanished completely. These Asian fiat markets may increase substantially if regulatory scrutiny in the region is clarified or if domestic mainland Chinese exchanges open again.  The Brazilian real (BRL) pair has been increasing in volume over the past few weeks and has surpassed all Asian and European pairs. The BTC/BRL currently holds a 3.7% premium over the BTC/USD pair. This follows a trend of increasing volumes coming out of all of South America in the past few months, likely related to the political upheaval and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.  Several potentially game-changing BTC services are also in the works and slated for launch this year. On March 7th, Fidelity Digital Assets announced the launch of a custody service to a select group of eligible clients. The financial behemoth manages over US$2.45 trillion in assets. Bakkt, which raised US$182.5 million from 12 partners and investors in 2018, is also set to launch a physically delivered BTC future some time this year. Bakkt is a subsidiary of the Intercontinental Exchange, which also runs the New York Stock Exchange. Starbucks has also received a significant equity stake in the Bakkt BTC futures platform. A fresh application for the VanEck-SolidX BTC ETF was also submitted in February to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, after the proposal was pulled in January during the government shutdown. All previous BTC ETF proposals have been rejected by the U.S. regulator, while several other BTC ETNs are available worldwide and seeing increasing volumes.    A price deviation between the USDT and USD exchanges continues to persist (right panel, chart below), specifically between Bitfinex and Coinbase. The price deviation, which started to increase in mid-October, was due in large part to a decrease in the USDT market rate (left panel, chart below). Recently, the BTC price premium has remained near US$100, or about 2.5%, while the USDT market rate has been more volatile but currently remains near US$1.00. The premium is currently 1.85%.  These price differentials are also likely related to a 3% withdraw fee implemented by Bitfinex late last year, which was enacted to curb repetitive smaller fiat withdrawals. On March 8th, Bitfinex announced a reduction in the minimum withdrawal limit to US$20, which may help increase arbitrage and decrease existing premiums. An extended period of a US$1.00 market rate for USDT would suggest a return to normal market conditions.    Global over the counter (OTC) volume, from LocalBitcoins.com, finished 2018 higher than any period throughout the year and has remained at those levels since January 2019. The biggest increases in BTC and notional volume over the past few months have come from South American countries where inflation or hyperinflation has devalued local currencies. Notional volume has also recently spiked in Indonesia, Iran, South Africa, and the United States.    Google Trends for the term ""bitcoin"" remains pinned firmly on the floor and also remained down sharply over the course of 2018. Despite the declining interest, the search ""what is bitcoin"" was the most popular ""what is"" Google search of 2018.  A slow rise in searches for ""bitcoin"" preceded the bull run in Q4 2017, likely signaling a large swath of new market participants at that time. A 2015 study found a strong correlation between google trends data and BTC price whereas a 2017 study concluded that when U.S. Google ""bitcoin"" searches increased dramatically, BTC price dropped.    Technical Analysis  BTC price volatility has dropped dramatically over the past few weeks as price has trended up slightly. Overall, price action continues to flirt with a full-blown bullish reversal. Roadmaps for key decision points on high timeframes can be found using exponential moving averages (EMAs), volume, Ichimoku Cloud, and chart patterns. Further background information on the technical analysis discussed below can be found .  On the daily chart, the 50 and 200 day EMAs are a litmus test for the trend, and have been bearishly crossed since May 15th, 2018. Price had been mostly lower than the 50 EMA since that cross, until early March with a break North and a quick return to test the 50 EMA as support. The 50 EMA and historic volume (horizontal bars) both suggest the US$3,980 should act as significant support. A clean break above the 50EMA should signify bullish momentum with a likely push towards the 200 EMA at US$4,750.  There are currently no volume or RSI divergences. Long/short open interest on Bitfinex (top panel, chart below) is currently slightly net long with short positions dropping over the past few days and long positions increasing since mid-March.    Turning to the Ichimoku Cloud, there are four key metrics; the current price in relation to the Cloud, the color of the Cloud (red for bearish, green for bullish), the Tenkan (T) and Kijun (K) cross, and the Lagging Span. The best entry always occurs when most of the signals flip from bearish to bullish, or vice versa.  On the weekly chart, the Cloud metrics are bearish; price is below the Cloud, the Cloud is bearish, the TK cross is bearish, and the Lagging Span is below price and below the Cloud. A long entry based on traditional Cloud strategy would not be warranted until price breaches the Cloud.  Comparing current price action to 2014, 2015, and 2016, a similar Cloud fractal has begun to form. This pattern previously took 300 days to turn bullish after multiple support and resistance tests. If repeated, similar price action would break US$6,200 around September 2019. In the near term, the Tenkan at US$4,800 will likely act as resistance. Over the course of the next two years, the Cloud projects a target of US$10,250 based on the long flat Kumo at that price level. However, if the current lows do not hold, falling towards the previous all-time high at US$1,000 always remains a possibility.    On the daily chart, the Cloud metrics are bearish to neutral; price is in the Cloud, the Cloud is newly bullish, the TK cross is bullish, and the Lagging Span is above price and in the Cloud. This is the first bullish Kumo twist since November 2016 and typically is highly indicative of a trend change. However, a long entry based on traditional Cloud strategy would not be warranted until price breaches the Cloud.  Price had been held below the Cloud since mid-January 2018. If the current local low holds without making a new lower low, then a move towards the flat Kumo at US$4,850 becomes more and more likely. These trades are known as Edge to Edge trades and typically require a bullish TK cross before entering a long position. All Edge to Edge trades have a stop loss at the bottom of Cloud support, currently at US$3,785. This trade setup carries a risk/reward ratio of six, indicating a highly favorable long setup.  Additionally, a bullish reversal chart pattern, the Adam and Eve, completed with multiple firm rejection at the horizontal resistance. The hallmarks of the pattern include a V and U-shaped price structure with a declining volume profile which increases in volume once horizontal resistance is broken. Both the 1.618 fib extension and measured move of the pattern point to the US$5,000 range as a price target. Price may continue to range while making higher lowers and get rejected at the US$4,100 level, which would form an ascending triangle.    Lastly, the opening and expiration dates of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) BTC futures contracts can have a significant impact on price. The CME facilitates trading of the largest portion of derivatives contracts in the world.  The CME BTC futures contracts first opened in December 2017 on low volume, but volumes for the product have increased significantly throughout 2018. At the end of February, the CME saw the highest volume ever in a single day for the BTC futures product.  The January 28th, 2018 contract opening saw a price fall within the first few days, which has consistently been the case on the two month contracts since inception. The September 4th contract opened at almost exactly the local top for price. Shorts which opened at the start of the December 31st three-month contract are currently slightly underwater.  Based on previous volatility zones around the open and close of CME contracts, March 28th to April 1st should be highly volatile for price. Additionally, this time period marks the end of Q1 and the beginning of Q2, meaning all other quarterly futures contracts will also be refreshed during this time period.    Conclusion  On-chain transactions per day have continued to show a sustained and significant rise over the past few months, which can mainly be attributed to VeriBlock, a mechanism for securing other blockchains using the BTC blockchain. VeriBlock does not use Segwit and some have called the mining strategy ""transaction spam."" Block size has also continued to grow due to VeriBlock, with no impact on the transaction fee market. Hashrate has increased substantially over the past few months with a large expected increase coming in 11 days. Block times have trended below 10 minutes thanks to the increasing hashrate with no sustained queue pending transactions. Off-chain, the Lightning Network continues to grow rapidly as well, thanks to the highly publicized transaction relay and other adoption initiatives becoming both high-profile and widely successful.  Technicals on higher time frames remain neutral to bullish, warranting a wait and see approach prior to any potential trend reversal. Trend indicators, including the weekly Tenkan, daily Cloud, and daily 200EMA suggest the US$5,000 zone as a reversal target should price gain bullish momentum. An Adam and Eve bullish reversal chart pattern also has a price target of ~US$5,000 adding to the bullish confluence. Despite the recent rejection at US$4,100, price has remained above the daily 50EMA and above the daily Kijun. Price action below US$3,600 would likely bring price towards the previous consolidation zone from May through August 2017, from US$2,000-US$2,800."
"470",787,2019-03-23,"Brave New Coin","Launch of the Cosmos Hub inter-blockchain communication protocol brings unification of the entire blockchain ecosystem a step closer.  In the early days of Bitcoin and Ethereum, many anticipated a winner-takes-all outcome, where one blockchain would eventually act as the go-to platform for all transactions and decentralized applications.  But as the industry progressed, this idealism became less feasible. Without forking and the creation of new chains, experimentation proved to be extremely limited, and soon enough, hundreds of blockchains were springing up — each claiming to be adapted to a specific purpose within the larger blockchain ecosystem.  In the traditional business sector, the issue of siloed data and its negative impact on process efficiency has been a hot topic for decades - and it continues to be so. Literally billions has been spent trying to get different databases to talk to each other, with varying degrees of success.  No surprise then, that the same integration issue has reared its head again in the blockchain economy where the task of connecting siloed blockchains and enabling them to scale effectively, has proven to be a significant challenge.  , which went live last week, is one potential solution, acting as a coordinating blockchain that forms a bridge between different chains, allowing each to detect the state of the other, and exchange assets trustlessly between the networks.  As well as allowing existing blockchains to connect, Cosmos provides a network of public blockchains for developers to use that are all built using the same Tendermint engine. Each individual blockchain (or Zone in Cosmos terms) is built on the same standard protocol, and can seamlessly connect to the bridging blockchain, known as the Hub.  Says Tendermint CEO Jae Kwon: ""Blockchain technology is an incredible innovation that has unfortunately been hamstrung by a series of limitations, including scalability problems, a lack of usability and myriad of governance and environmental issues. The vision of Cosmos is to overcome these limitations and break down barriers to innovation, ultimately creating an internet of blockchains - a decentralized network of independent, scalable, and interoperable blockchains.""  Cosmos and Atomic Swaps  To a certain extent, the promises of Cosmos have already been delivered by other cross-blockchain communication projects. Atomic Swaps — like  — already allow blockchains with similar characteristics to swap assets using a layer two network. However, the Atomic Swaps solution is limited in the number of blockchains between which swaps can occur.  In the grand plan, this interoperability limitation is what Cosmos seeks to solve. By providing a backbone for the whole ecosystem where value can be shared – not just between two similar blockchains – but potentially between any blockchains that can plug into the Hub. However, Cosmos is currently limited to blockchains that share a ""fast-finality"" settlement mechanism, which includes Proof of Stake blockchains like Dash and NEO.  Probabilistic-finality chains, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, can also be plugged into Cosmos, but an additional '' is needed to act as an adapter. Eventually, these Peg Zones are expected to be configured to fit many different types of blockchains.  Cross-chain competition  In the three years that Cosmos has been in development, blockchain interoperability has become a hot topic, and was recently cited by the  as one of the major roadblocks preventing progress. As such, a number of high-profile projects are now battling it out to become the ""blockchain of blockchains"", and act as the universal connective tissue for cross-chain communication.  AION, ICON, and Wanchain, which together form the , are all working on their own multi-tier blockchain networks that involve a degree of interoperability.  ICON, South Korea's most eminent blockchain project, is built on Loopchain — a blockchain engine that is the equivalent of Tendermint, and acts as an intermediary chain connecting an ecosystem of blockchains known as the ICON republic.  AION and Wanchain themselves have similar projects, and alongside Cosmos, Parity's  has emerged as another frontrunner. Developed by Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood, Polkadot is another blockchain interoperability protocol that went live with a proof of concept in , and is set to launch its official network in the third quarter of this year.  But as the first to launch, Cosmos has a significant head start, and has already managed to secure several prestigious partnerships. Biggest exchange by volume  has already built its DEX on forks of Tendermint and Cosmos; blockchain gaming platform has announced that its  will be Cosmos-compatible, and social media streaming service , which counts more than 400,000 downloads on iOS, plans to use Cosmos to develop a token economy."
