\par\par \b \uc2 Hedera Price Forecast as HBAR Shoots Up 8% \u8211\'20\'13 $1 Coming Soon\b0\par\par\uc2 477 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 October 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Hedera (HBAR) is a leading cryptocurrency project focused on creating an energy-efficient layer-1 blockchain fit for enterprise purposes. Now, the price of HBAR has risen by an impressive 8% in a single day. Could this be the momentum needed to push HBAR to $1?\par \par \uc2 What is Hedera HBAR?\par \par \uc2 Hedera aims to be the blockchain of the future. While many networks exist, most are either inefficient or insecure. However, Hedera provides investors with a highly secure network that offers low fees, fast settlement time, and excellent throughput.\par \par \uc2 In addition to its merit as a transactional cryptocurrency, Hedera has smart contract functionality similar to Ethereum. This means that developers can take advantage of the network's efficiency. With so many developers looking for lower-cost solutions, the Hedera ecosystem has grown significantly since its release, likely helping to bolster the asset's price.\par \par \uc2 HBAR Price\par \par \uc2 While the asset had been in a downward trend following a strong move in July, things seemed to stabilize at $0.058 prior to an attempted breakout toward the $0.074 region. However, there was not enough momentum to sustain this breakout, leading the price of HBAR to retrace to its previous level.\par \par \uc2 Since mid-September, the price of HBAR had been hovering at around $0.058 with many investors speculating that the asset was consolidating prior to a sharp upward move. Now, it seems that move has arrived. Over the past day, HBAR jumped in value by around 8%, pushing the asset back toward $0.063.\par \par \uc2 With this level aligning with a key support region for HBAR, we could see some impressive moves coming in the near future. With that said, it's important to understand that for HBAR to retain this level, it will need a confirmed daily break above $0.062.\par \par \uc2 With HBAR trading for just above $0.50 at its peak, the asset could make for an excellent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/best-long-term-crypto.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 long-term crypto}}}\uc2  investment. With the focus on \uc2 environmental\uc2 , social, and governance (ESG) investing increasing sharply each year, we could see HBAR fly past its previous high toward the $1 region within the next year.\par \par \uc2 While HBAR is often heralded as one of the most environmentally-friendly cryptocurrencies on the market, it pales in comparison to the offerings from IMPT, a new crypto project aiming to help reduce the world's carbon emissions by tokenizing credits that equate to offsetting 1 ton of carbon. More details can be found in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://impt.io/assets/documents/WHITEPAPER.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 IMPT whitepaper}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 With the project currently in its phase one presale, there's no better time to check out IMPT. Join the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/IMPTprogram"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 IMPT Telegram group}}}\uc2  to stay informed regarding the development of the asset.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/ext/impt/en%20%20Notes"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Visit IMPT}}}\par \par \uc2 Related News and Analysis\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/hedera-crypto-price-prediction-october-2022-will-hbar-pump-more.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 HBAR vs IMPT Price Prediction}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/new-green-crypto-predicted-50x-by-2023.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 This New Green Crypto is Predicted to 50x}}}\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/how-to-buy-impt-token.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How to Buy IMPT Token}}}\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020221012eiac0005m\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Without further ado, I'm very pleased to welcome Ori to the Cryptonews Podcasts. Ori, welcome to the show.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Thanks so much for having me.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 That is quite the bio there. You are a computer scientist, you are a food writer, and you love design a little bit of everything. I love to see that I'm a big foodie myself, I have to start with the topic of food. What is your go-to? What is your favorite food? And what is it like being a food writer, I feel like that is a low-key everyone's dream job.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I'm really the kind of person who wants to eat something different every day. So I don't know if I have a go-to but something that I end up eating a lot of is curry, you know, I'm actually in Japan right now, which is where I was living before the pandemic. And most people when they think of Japanese food, I think they think of you know, sushi or like Tempura or Udon that kind of thing, of course, ramen. But actually,` the number one food that Japanese young people eat and that kids eat growing up. It's actually curry here. So Japanese style curry, and there's also a whole sort of alternative movement of like spice curry is what they call it spice cut it which is really just like any curry that actually has any spice influenced often by Indian Sri Lankan cuisines, etc. And I love it. It's like really creative, you get like really Japanese stuff like, like local fish put in the curry and stuff like that. And it's just like super fun. So yeah, being a food writer, I don't know if I've I really haven't done much lately, and I've been pretty busy with the whole crypto thing. But it was a really fun kind of like side hustle to try being a food writer. And I think it's really rewarding. So I would recommend that to anyone who's interested because all you need to do is just like pitch them articles. And if one of the editors likes your idea, you're off to the races.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 So interesting there. The curry take I've never heard of that before. And like Japanese culture is so, it has such a lens on it. You know, like every not every other but so many other cultures really look up to Japanese culture, whether it's food, or whatever. But the curry thing that just that's bananas to me like I've never heard of that.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, people just don't know, because Japanese curry is really not that popular abroad. Unless you're part of probably like the Asian community. I guess it's something that we just kind of know about. But there's not a lot of like Japanese curry restaurants in the States, for example. And so that's something that I encourage you to try out because I think it is really great. It's very unique. It's actually more inspired by the British curries, I was brought over when the British Navy first visited Japan. And so that's where it has no spice whatsoever. But it's still curry.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 That's so cool. Let's jump right into design. I'm a huge fan of incredible design, shout out to your website, I'm sure you had some influence on that. It is just about as beautiful, simple and sexy as it gets the little jellyfish in the background, the little fish. He's the sort of bottom of the ocean, the blues, the yellows. It's so bloody clean. I absolutely love that I love going on a website, or using an application or a mobile app. And it just makes you feel good. How can the average Joe or Josephine sort of steal and learn from literal experts like you like what do you guys do? Are there other any bits of low-hanging fruit that people like me could take from this because this is such an important part of life. 99% of everything we use is just terrible from a design perspective, and then there's the oddballs and outliers like this, what can we do to learn some\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Actually, talk to people I would say is the key like show people your design how people use it and watch how they end interact with it. And that really is the core principle of human-centered design, which is what we practice at IDEO, what we practiced at Stanford's design school. And it really is not rocket science, it means that when you're starting with your design your project, it's not. Okay, what do I think would look good on this page? What do I think my users would like? It's actually going and talking to those users understanding what they react well to understanding what their actual needs are, and then designing a solution to that problem. I think good design can come in many, many forms, like I mentioned earlier in my bio, but I think one that's really underrated, it's actually about user experience design. I think it's wonderful if a site is beautiful, and I really am grateful to the talented illustrators who helped make Orca\u8217\'20\'19s site beautiful. But what's even more important, I think, is that it's very simple to use. And that really just comes from continued testing continued practice and intuition. And anyone who wants to learn it, I'd say, just look up human centered design. And there's tons of free resources available on the internet.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Is that where you would say to start? That's the best place?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I would say so. So honestly, like I know, IDEO, which is the design firm that I used to work at has like free toolkits online for starting to learn about human-centered design. There's sort of this repeatable process that we use for all of the projects back when I was a consultant at IDEO. And it really always starts with the same thing like need-finding, talking to people. And then you do some synthesis, like, what are the things we learned from those people? And then we do some idea generation, like, what types of things could we build that actually solve those needs? Then you narrow down to a solution, et cetera, et cetera. And so it really is this repeatable process. And, you know, starting my career at \uc2 Coursera\uc2 , as well, I know that there's so much high-quality free education out there. So if you're serious about practicing design, that's a whole discipline that you can just learn just like engineering.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Well said, Yeah, \uc2 Coursera\uc2  is absolutely brilliant. There's so many. So many of these just sort of free course platforms out there. Heck, you can get, you know, an E Online Harvard degree, right, like it's and where you went Sanford as well. Absolutely insane. Bananas. You are a programmer, designer, Illustrator and the co-founder of Orca with such a design-oriented background. What made you get into crypto like that? You don't I mean, that doesn't? Yes, there's such a need for the two to be intertwined, but it's not a traditional career path into the cryptocurrency space.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, it's totally true. I was chatting with my co-founder the other day, and we're like, what would ourselves three years ago, which is just before we started working on Orca, have thought seeing ourselves today? And my thought was like, I think Oreo three years ago would be like crypto No, no way. Because I was definitely not one of those people who's been following since like, 2014, I really kind of fell down the rabbit hole. Because I was pulled, so to speak, I think a lot of people are pulled. And that really was by meeting my co-founder, here in Tokyo, I was actually living in Tokyo at the time and had just moved into a new place. And across the hall was my co-founder. He just happened to live there already. And he had been working and been interested in crypto for a long time. At the time, he was actually contributed to the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2 . And it just so happened that that was around the time when like COVID was getting really intense. We all got locked in, in Tokyo. And so you know, it was kind of actually really fun, at first, like being locked in with your friends. But after some period of time, we just started getting bored, and like hacking on some projects together. And one thing led to another. And finally, we had this crypto startup. So sometimes life just kind of like takes you by surprise.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 It's crazy. And I assume that's the best of both worlds. Obviously, as part of the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2 , he had and has quite a sort of technical background, and you come in with the design and you know, artsy side. And that's really what exactly what you want. That's how you get that match right now.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, I think we got really lucky. Like, I think our conversation was pretty much like, Hey, I'm an engineer and a designer, you're an engineer, like I probably favor that front end, and you probably favorite, the back end. Like there's a lot we could build together with just the two of us. I've always actually identified as like a jack of all trades, and never had really a strong leaning towards any particular one thing growing up, which made me I think, feel very mediocre. And a society that really rewards and celebrates people who are very, extremely good at one thing. But I've realized that often it's like folks like myself who are willing to wear like any hat and actually kind of enjoy wearing any hat that can make a startup happen because you really do need people who can juggle all these different roles when you only have like two or three people on a team.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 So well that there are society rewarding specialists over generalists, that's very true. It's no different than other aspects of life cooking, right? The best chefs in the world usually specialize in a couple of different things and boom, they're off to the races. Athletes do the best and the best is zero point. 00 1% in your sport, that's why you're getting paid 10 to 50 mil a year. It's crazy. It's very, very true. Most of us, myself included generalist for the most part, but you really want to get out there and make a name for yourself. God become a specialist. Well said already well said. Let's talk about Orca. Give me the elevator pitch. Give me the 32-second. What do you and the team do? And I can't wait to get into some of the cylinder base stuff. But let's start with the Orca elevator pitch.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 For sure. So Orca is the leading crypto marketplace on Solana. By leading, I say we're actually leaving in terms of trading volume, which is what we believe is the key metric that you should look at when it comes to measuring a crypto marketplace. I think when it comes to discussions of crypto if everyone's like TBL, TBL TBL. But if you're looking at a marketplace, I think what really matters is how much people are trading. So there's that. And Orca is known for a couple of different things. I think one is the focus on human-centered design that you've mentioned so far. I think that goes beyond just how people are interacting with the interface and into really everything that Orca does. From the Climate Fund that we'll talk about, I believe a little bit later, to being extremely developer friendly. So a lot of Orca\u8217\'20\'19s efforts lately have gone into building the best possible development experience for builders who are extending Orca for all sorts of applications from you know, these liquidity aggregators, to trade aggregators, to vaults and games, etc. And so, say Orca, at its core is really a concentrated liquidity, AMM, that is designed to take away all the complexity that goes into being in concentrated liquidity AMM. And just provide a really simple trading interface for everyone.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 You talked about the importance of developers, this seems like a very straightforward point. And it is, the more devs you have building on your platform, the wider you become, the more powerful you become. It's how you onboard the next billion users, which is the thing we're all trying to do. The thing that interests me the most. And my question for you, Ori, how do you incentivize developers to come on your platform, the easiest is always the money aspect, right bounties here, Grant here, big floats or incentive programs, but money financial incentives side, how do you get devs to build on your platform?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 You have to make it easy for them. Like this is something that I deeply understand having been a dev for actually, like the longest stretch of my career was as a dev, right. And as a dev, really what you're doing is not writing code from scratch, I think people who, you know, see the those like, movies of like programmers kind of like judges, and they're just like writing tons and tons of code. Like, that's not really the reality, right? Like, what we're doing is actually taking these Legos and web2 actually has like an even bigger library of Legos and web3, and people are just like composing these Legos. And really, usually what you're doing is like building a ton of these Legos, and then you write like a, like one new Lego on top. And so like, what you got to do is make your Lego extremely easy to use, right? And that's what we've done through a super, super simple SDK. And also through having this staff of really incredible developer advocates who just shout out to Yeti and you good air current to amazing developer advocates who are there to answer developers questions every step of the way. Because nothing is more frustrating than just like getting an error no matter what you're doing, whether you're coding or like trying to buy a plane ticket, and then you go to the Help button. And then it just like gets you down some kind of automated phone support rabbit hole, right? Like you want to talk to an actual person. And so I think those are the two ways that are different.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 And the second one, sorry, you touched on the second one, the summation of that was customer support kind of thing.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, so developer support. And first of all, is like, you know, the ideal situation is that it just works. And now in the majority of time, I think Orca\u8217\'20\'19s SDK is designed to be super simple, so that anyone can really just use it without much effort. Everything is open source. The \uc2 Whirlpool\uc2  smart contract is open source. And the SDK itself is open source. So developers can also really like look at the guts, but if they have questions, there's also like real people they can talk to and Orca\u8217\'20\'19s discord.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Gotcha. Interesting. See, as someone who does not code that would be so freakin awesome. And that's like when I have problems that are not even remotely as complex as ones that your devs are working on I also like, no shit, I don't know why I'm having this aha moment right now. It's so friend of mine. It's so simple, but this is huge. Very good point. There. Very, very good point. Wow, can you just put my head in a blender there? I can't believe more. Why don't more people do this? It seems like there's really not that much overhead. Either right, having one or two senior devs who can answer questions in a quick and remote fashion or creating again, just like what you guys have some type of developer discord where the community almost manages itself like Is this really that hard to implement?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Well,it is. And it isn't. I mean, I think it is hard and that finding devs is hard. And then every dev who you have that's focused on, like answering other people's questions, well, those are hours of the day that could go into core development, right. And so it's a hard trade-off. And also, not every dev really enjoys, like answering questions, right, there's like a certain personality type, I think. And that personality type is usually like the kind of person who gets a lot of joy out of helping other people, which is just really lovely to see. But I think I probably know more devs who get joy out of like the art of creation, which is the other thing that they should be spending time on, and many do both as well, right. And also, I should also say that many other projects do have developer support. And many of the most successful ones do you know, many companies are built on top of good customer service and Dev experience is really just one of those versions. So that's why when I talk about user experience, I think of users in many different forms. You know, Orca has a couple audiences. There are the traders there, the market makers, and then there is these builders, and all of them are users and all of them deserve a good experience.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Love that. Let's jump into Orca\u8217\'20\'19s initiative with climate. Now. I know this hits very close to home with you. It is very front and center with a lot of your company ethos, your company narrative, you guys do an incredible job of really pushing this out to the public, for great reasons. Climate footprint is a massive issue present day and Orca is doing a hell of a lot to not just sort of manage that, but measure it as well. The one thing that I couldn't find on my show notes, and this is definitely on me and not your team. But you guys talk a lot about your climate footprint and how you are measuring that. How do you measure that? How do you measure the climate footprint of you know, your output?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 It's a really hard question, because it really depends on what you determine is as yours or ours. Right. I think there's a couple of different scopes. And this is something that we've only recently started to look at on the Orca Climate Fund, which I'm a contributor to so Orca directs like a portion of all of its trading volume to the Orca Climate Fund, which has historically, and my original idea was to use it all for philanthropy. But more and more recently started to move towards Orca actually doing its own proactive initiatives like the carbon accounting, unlike the article that I published recently, and welcome anyone who's interested in this topic to read, because that really chronicles the deep dive that I did, along with other Orca Climate Fund contributors to zoom in and Andy, into really everything that could be considered part of the footprint. And so I would say long story short, one, the simplest way of thinking about it, and the way that I felt was most important to start was really just by looking at the energy consumption of the protocol itself. And the protocol itself is a much smaller scope, really just like the smart contracts, the SDKs. And then ultimately, like the validators and RPC nodes that are powering the transactions that Orca runs on. And so, you know, what we discovered is actually that, compared to, you know, the everyone always loves to talk about, like how proof of work is destroying the world. And you know, it does use a lot of energy. But Solana is like already incredibly energy efficient, right? I think just like, it's actually so efficient, that almost like trying to reduce the energy consumption of the Solana protocols is not necessarily the most effective way to approach the problem. And just like one example of that, is just based on the accounting that I've done, like on average, it looks like roughly like a round trip flight from somewhere like New York, to Lisbon, which is where the Solana conference will be is like 1.5 metric tons of carbon emitted. And the entire Solana network only takes something around, I think it was like 3000 metric tons of carbon for 2021. So the Solana breakpoint conference this year has 5000 Tickets available. So if there are 5000 tickets, on average, takes like one metric ton of carbon to fly there, then the conference is generating more than the entire network. And so you know, what we've done looking at the Orca Climate Fund is to commit to either buying tokenized offsets for the actual like RPC nodes that Orca rounds, which are the servers that actually serve Orcas requests to the blockchain. And that's one thing, but then another is to actually just offset all of the flights that the team contributors are purchasing to break point because ultimately, I think we want to put things in perspective a little bit like yes, it's important to take responsibility for what energy the protocol creates, but like, what's the actual bigger impact here and it's probably off chain activities.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 That's crazy that you have that outlook, it's absolute cash. I friggin love that. Again, I'm just looking at my notes and it's like, so often companies will do what they think is the right thing, right? What sort of the public wants to hear, but like, you just look me dead ass in the eye. And we're like, look, we're, I'm telling you right now, we can make a better change. And we can do more for climate by showing that, hey, the flights we take is a hell of a lot more no bueno than using Solana as a whole. And therefore we are going to offset this via Orcas climate. Yeah, this is this is I absolutely love this. This is, this is great. Or you should be helping a lot more web3 leaders in this. How could you do that? If you were running a crypto backed sort of Climate Initiative? What would your protocols be? What would your rules and regs be? What would sort of your you know, your top five or whatever big points? What would you attack right off the bat? What's the lowest hanging fruit?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I think the lowest hanging fruit really is starting to look at like energy reduction and offsets. So asking your validators or you're like the RPC node providers that you work with, for example, to move towards more renewable energy if available. I think, you know, offsets are very contentious. And there we've also written a lot about this in the article. So I think doing your own research, or if you choose to purchase offsets and making sure that you're purchasing high quality offsets that are actually nature based and contributing to the long term health of the planet, is another one. But I would say the ultimate principle to abide by is exactly what you said. It's not about what looks good. Because philanthropy for the third purpose of looking good is very common. Greenwashing is a term that's used a lot here, but really more thinking about what is the actual impact of the actions. And that's something that you know, I think, even I felt a little bit guilty of when to sin, who is another the OCF contributor who has a \uc2 sustainability\uc2  background was saying, like, hey, it's really, really great that we're doing these donations, it's meaningful, but what can we actually do that's more like Orca native, that's more web three climate native. And, you know, it's not ultimately up to me to make all the decisions and because it is a decentralized protocol, and I'm, at the end of the day, actually just a contributor. But I do think it's very meaningful for founders to come out and say that this is important. And so Orcas two missions are one to create more financial opportunity through equal access to markets, but second to also have a positive impact on our climate. And I think enshrining that at the Mission level of the company is like the most important thing that a founder can do.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Why did you feel the need to enshrine that at the core level of the company? Because again, at the end of the day, you guys are your Solana based defi ecosystem, right? Like the climate isn't primary, it very well could be secondary. And again, I'm nitpicking here, but why do you feel that it's such an important topic that it is the second most important part of your ethos.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Everyone needs to take responsibility for climate like it or not? Right? And this is something that yeah, I don't have the deepest climate background, but it's just become very obvious to me that this is the biggest threat facing our planet today. And it's irresponsible, I think for someone who has as much influence and power as like a company founder to not care about this at all. And when we started Orca, like, to be honest, yeah, I'm very dubious about the ultimate like impact of crypto on the world right now, I don't think crypto is necessarily like a net positive or negative, right? There's a lot of different lenses through which you can view good or bad. But one thing that I felt was strictly a good thing and it was important for us to do was to make an impact on something that was kind of like undeniably good, in my opinion that that's climate.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 I love that well said extremely well said alright, let's jump into Solana a little more GameFi-ish. Right. Solana GameFi is absolutely popping off at the moment. There are tons of new games being built. One of my favorite parts is the play to earn movement is sort of almost gone now, which I absolutely love to see. Use the power of the blockchain to let gamers and users own their in-game assets and play and maybe earn not play to earn earnings should not be the primary ethos. The primary ethos is having fun and rewarding the attention economy and if you want to own your in-game assets, great. You can do that for you the blockchain more specifically, we know where to Solana GameFi I know Orcas doing a lot of work there. How will Orca power the Solana game fight ecosystem?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Building a game is hard, like crazy hard. Yeah, I'm a lifelong gamer. I grew up I remember like five years old. My dad took me to a secondhand game shop and he was like, Pick anything you want. And like I just picked Kirby's Dreamland and it really all just started there. I'm proud of my five year olds choice like Sal for making that choice out of probably all the really crap games that were available there.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 That's a vet move.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, very proud. Looking back. Um, but yeah, like looking forward. You know, as a dev and someone who loves games, I had always thought about building a game, and I've dabbled a little bit like You know, not much. But when I was at \uc2 Coursera\uc2 , I took their game developer specialization, I dabbled a bit in unity and made like some really simple platformers. And like, man, it is so hard to build a game like, it's actually incredible that games run as well as they do. And like, you know, a lot of the time we can't even get basic web apps to work, right? So I think what Orca is really offering is that Lego, because now games have to worry about not only all of the existing things around frame rates, and bugs, and blah, blah, blah, but also bootstrapping a functioning token economy. And that's clearly something that entire companies and protocols are built around. So it's kind of unrealistic to expect them to spin it up themselves and just add that to their workload. So in this, what we're really aiming to be is that truly simple, truly easy to use, DeFi Lego. And we found that like games really appreciate having someone who understands that point of view as well as like having that dedicated support to help them bridge over from web2 to web3.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 DeFi Lego? Can you keep going on that term? For me? I feel like you have a hell of a lot more. On that term. I feel like there's a bunch of gold nuggets just chilling up there. Keep going on that.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I love it. Yeah, I guess DeFi Lego, maybe that was like a hotter term, even two years ago. Now everyone's like web3 and NFTs. But it really is like the promise of being able to build anything that has to do with like finance or financial tools in web3, using all these existing building blocks. So Lego really just speaks to building blocks, right. And as I mentioned, most folks building in web2 are also using these Legos, right? If you go on to NPM, there's just an amazing, incredible resource of open source tools that people have put out there. I think the most beautiful thing about like the internet, is that openness, right? Like the fact that there are so much information, so many tools that you can just go out there and use right like, I can't even imagine front end development without react. And you know, as soon as people have different opinions about \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , but I think the best and like most clearly good thing that \uc2 Facebook\uc2  has ever done is open source, the React library, because it just made building so much better. And that's what we want to do with like Orca is just put out these tools that people can use to build things that honestly like we couldn't even dream of. And really, it's like building anything that requires a market. And like markets, you know, people have lots of negative views on finance in general, but everyone wants like financial opportunity, right? And financial opportunity is created when people have the actual assets or value to like be able to take risks, right I think it feels very abstract as I'm talking about this, but let's say like, you know, back in the day, some explorer wanted to go on a voyage you know, they need assets, they need a ship, they need all these like you know actual goods to power the voyage and you need someone to actually transfer those assets. And this is like a very abstract version of that in the future where people can build anything that allows people to transfer these assets to fund these different opportunities\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Great analogy! Folks we are gonna take a quick break and when we come back Ori is going to keep dropping knowledge bombs got a huge shout out to our sponsor the show that is PrimeXBT you guys know I love PrimeXBT as I've been using them for a hot minute now. Why do I love them because they offer a robust trading system for both beginners and professional traders doesn't matter if you're a rookie or a vet, you can easily design and customize your layouts and widgets to best fit your trading style. The promo code is CRYPTONEWS50 and that gives you 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account only for listeners of the Cryptonews pod that is CRYPTONEWS50 to receive 50% of your deposit credited to your trading account. And I'm back to the show with Ori. Alright, let's keep buzzing on Solana for a little bit. I know this is very cliche. But whenever I have an industry leader who specializes within the salon ecosystem, I always learn something new that I didn't know before. And I'm going to ask the same question to you. Tell me about a couple of the benefits of building on Solana.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Solana\u8217\'20\'19s is team is ridiculously good. And they are ridiculously good developers. One thing that I think differentiates Solana from other chains is that their team really understands what it means to build an extremely difficult to operate network at this very high scale. And yes, that sometimes means that there are troubles, you know, early on when you're actually fielding like a ton of network requests. And we've seen like Solana go down. But I think the recovery has actually been very, fairly elegant. And folks in the ecosystem are very supportive and very mature. And they all really believe in building this decentralized ecosystem that is fast enough and has low enough fees to actually scale to support any kind of application. Right and just from talking to Anatoly to Raj and to the team, I think, like you can tell that they really believe in this vision and they're not just like theoretical researchers. You know, I think a lot of chains it's like, oh, really cool theoretical consensus mechanism, but ultimately, like, can they scale to serve all of these different users? So it's kind of like the jury's out but we fit on Solana.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Do you guys have access to the team? Like is it like literally, you know, signal or telegram quickness kind of thing, fire off a message, they get back to you ASAP.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I mean, I do, which is pretty great. But that's like human relationships, right? Like, I think we've met these folks. We've been around since the beginning, like we hung out at break point. And I'm a nomad. So I've kind of just tried to hang out with folks wherever I go. And so I was like, doing a 24 hour layover in Chicago the other day, and Solana has an office there. So I just like spun by grab coffee, and just try to focus on the fact that, you know, we're all humans just kind of grinding. Like, it sounds glamorous. But you know, we're all tired, where we all can like empathize and the challenges we face. And like having those connections on a human level is so meaningful.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 That's so cool. And the classic question, which everyone always wants to know. Did you ever think about ETH. Did you ever know polygon wouldn't have worked for what you guys are doing, but was there ever another option? Another protocol in which you decided to build on or was it just like salon from the get go, we're gonna do this and we're gonna run with it.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Well, before we actually built Orca on Solana, my co founder Yutaro. And I actually did build a little application on Ethereum. It was called Wallaroo, it was supposed to be like a high interest savings app type thing on Ethereum. And, you know, when we started Yutaro, was actually a contributor at the \uc2 Ethereum foundation\uc2 . So we're definitely not chain maxis. I think it was really just the starting from user experience, right? Like, it doesn't make sense. And it's not a good experience for users who want to like, do like a high interest savings app type experience, when gas fees are like $50. And so it's like, how can we develop the experience that we want for users? Looked around? Yeah, Solana basically caught Yutaro eye back when SPF and FTX were actually investing in ecosystem as well. And just like, did some due diligence or like, mind blown like this. There's actually like a non sharded L one that can provide this type of like TPS and these incredibly low fees? Well, you know, the All that sounds like ridiculous, like \uc2 SpaceX\uc2  jargon to anyone who's not already, like pretty deep in the technical side of crypto. But what does it really mean? It means that you can build credibly simple and elegant experiences. And that's what matters.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Well said, building incredibly simple and elegant experiences. Wow. very articulate. Craziness. craziness. Craziness. Ori, this has been an absolute treat. I do know we're getting a little bit tight for time here. Let's keep going on Solana, what are the next couple months look like for the Solana ecosystem? I know there's a lot of big things planned. I know there's a lot of big things planned for Orca as well. What do we as consumers? What can we look forward to?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 That's a bear market, which also means that it's a builder's market, I think a lot of folks echo my feeling that it's just less distractions, right. And so what Orca is focused on right now is making that best possible Lego and making improvements to it. So one project that I'm really excited for that's kicking off is what we call the smart router, which is actually being able to route trades across multiple concentrated liquidity pools to provide better execution. Again, this is like at its core, one of those really complicated algorithms problems that ultimately translates to a much more elegant and simple experience for the end user. better prices, right? That's what every trader wants. And so they think it's these type of fundamental improvements that whereas actually might not even be that understandable to people on the outside actually prepares these Legos for like primetime use.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 So on the back end, crypto nerd explanation that would be being able to route trades across multiple complex liquidity pools, but on sort of the front end, not so nerdy, just you know, consumer facing more singular goal oriented, it would be cheaper trades, better prices.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Exactly. Yeah. So there's like technical improvements, which lead to better user experiences. And I think on the Solana side, as well as the protocol side, like also something Orca is doing is really investing in these like BD and these partnerships. I'm really excited for some of the upcoming game launches, really excited for some of the other kind of more retail focused partnerships that Solana side that I can't speak to, but I think I've definitely seen, you know, conversations flying around. And so I think what I see right now, as is laying the foundations, making sure that when we actually do, hopefully have like a super lively bull market ahead in the future, those applications are actually delivering real value to people.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 You continuously bring up the importance of user experience, it seems like, again, I'm putting words in your mouth, my apologies in advance here, but it seems like when you're building Orca, or when you built things in the past, that's like literally the forefront of everything. Do I have any grounds to say that and if that's the case, I'm just like, I'm thinking and I'm trying to look back at some of the things I've built and I'm just like, why haven't I prioritized user experience more than that that just makes so much sense. It's so bloody front of mind and simple, but no one does it. Is that true with you?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 What I care about is creating value, right? I'm a builder at heart, I actually remember when I was like, you know, 12. And we had talked about how, you know, they're kind of a jack of all trades, I didn't really know what I wanted to do. But I remember a piece of advice that my dad gave me at the time is try to focus on actually creating value and not just moving value around. Like, he's an engineer as well. So I think that's kind of like, where, where that spirit comes from. But I think you can't really create value, if no one is taking advantage of the things that you've created. So no matter how cool the thing is, if no one's using it, it's not creating value. And that's where user experience comes into play. Right? And I think you asked for a hot take earlier, so I'll just preempt you with a hot take, I think like very little in the entire NFT community is creating any value. I'm just like, I thought NFTs are really cool back in like 2019 when nobody was paying attention to NFTs I was like, but what kind of utility can they have? Like, what can these things power and so far, I think mostly what NFTs are, are these like exclusive boys clubs that are concentrating wealth in the hands of the already wealthy, because access to these NFTs gives you access to information that other people don't have, which you can use to like speculate on more NFTs. It's mostly just like all speculation. So personally, I'm very disappointed in what kind of exists out there. But I also at the same time, I'm very excited and hopeful for what NFTs, can power in the future. I think there's a ton of potential in the idea of these digital representations that can evolve over time, you know, based on like, metadata or based on just pure ownership. I think what's interesting about blockchains is like radical transparency, and also this like radically verifiable ownership. And there's tons of things that can be built on top of that, but we're just not there yet. And so, you know, crypto is a very money driven space speculation is bound to happen. But what I'm waiting for is the things that are happening after all of that kind of settles down a little bit.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Or you can't just stop there, you got to keep passing on that subject. Give me Give me some good give me some good NFT use cases. No, you got a hell of a lot more up there. You can't leave behind dry like that.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Well, I think the most imminent ones I really on in games, right. And I think that's why people are allowed to be very creative, because ultimately, the value that's created is entertainment. And I don't think I need to be like super stodgy and say like, all value has to be like, you know, lifting people out of poverty. Amazing. But I think entertainment is a value in itself as well. And that's where we're starting to see things like you know, even like composed NFTs one of the projects that we were talking about, was talking about NFTs that own and other NFTs. So I'll just like give an example is maybe, you know, I was like a NEO pets girl growing up, me too. You have these pets? Yeah, but those pets can own other pets. And then those pets can have like different equipment, right. And all of that stuff is can be expressed through NFTs. So that's kind of like one way of actually making these things like pretty interesting, right is like you can actually transfer that representation very simply and easily so that you actually can, you know, give someone else this this pet that you've invested in. But that's like a pretty well understood one, you know, this is purely just like my dreaming in my mind. But something that I experienced recently when I was actually in Mexico City for the first time, which shout out to Mexico City is probably now my other city favorite city in the world besides Tokyo. But it's so popular that when I went I was immediately Yeah, it's incredible. It's like super leafy super green, amazing climate cute dogs everywhere, amazing food friendly. People love it. And like a lot of other people love it and the Nomad community. So I was immediately hit with these, like eight different guides to Mexico City that different friends or friends of friends had created. And they were all in different formats, and all like, incompatible, right? So I ended up pretty much just kind of like, going back to my roots. And I just use the one that I thought was the nicest format, because that nice formatting means user experience, right? And all these other ones, like, they're just like, gone, you know, like, people put all these effort into these things, but like, unless I'm probably just gonna, like end up losing it in my email, right. And so one thing that I thought could be pretty interesting is actually to like have these different types of guides actually be NFTs in some kind of like, more standard format. So maybe you could see like, all of these different recommendations on a map and they could all be annotated, like this one's from Matt, and this one's from Ori This one's you know, has all the information like people's actual recommendations built in this kind of like very web2-type experience, I think that it still provides value in different ways. Maybe it's not like something as epic as like billions of dollars of trade volume, but like they're totally valid use cases that I think NFTs and like web three can be integrated into you in a way that's meaningful, just that it's perhaps the financial incentives aren't there yet.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Interesting. That's a great take there. I gotta ask a follow up, but Mexico City, I've never been on the bucketlist. At least the danger, I always hear crazy stories about the danger, is that still present that you need to know where to go or not to go? What's that like?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 So there are definitely parts of Mexico that are very dangerous. I've never been outside of Mexico City. And you know, again, this is speaking to what I've generally heard. But to be honest, I felt like incredibly safe the entire time I was there, I was traveling as a solo female. But there's like a very, very strong expat community in Mexico City. And there's certain neighborhoods that I think are just really lovely. They're just like, filled with both expats and actually a lot of locals, I think as well. You know, it's super affordable for someone who's lucky enough to come from America at least to like, take Ubers everywhere. Public transit is like a flat five pesos, which is like 25 cents. I just so easy to get around. And the fact that I couldn't, you know, Uber home after, like, a night out with friends meant that I actually didn't feel very safe. And so, you know, personally, I these days, I feel pretty unsafe in New York, like, yeah, that's like a whole another topic, but I think everything's relative, right?\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Yeah. 100% Yeah. New York's the homelessness there. And just the shootings and stabbings it's out of control. It's bananas.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, the world is a crazy place. I mean, if you weren't really safe come to Tokyo. Like this is definitely the safest place I've ever gotten to the point where you know, you get a little lax if you spent too much time here. I'm like, Yeah, I can just like leave my laptop open on a cafe table and no one's gonna take it right. That's just how things are.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 That's crazy. You must have been to Dubai right?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I haven't actually, no.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 The reason why I asked is because that's the safest I've ever felt I you know, swim in the ocean you laptop phone, wallet wide open on a beach chair. Not a worry in the world would didn't even look back at it. Whereas I don't think I genuinely don't think I've ever been anywhere else on the planet where I would do that. Even in my own country in Canada. I wouldn't, Toronto, I would never dream after that my phone would be gone at t minus two minutes like crazy. But then again, if you steal there, like your risk cut off. So different strokes for different folks, right?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Yeah, well, definitely a place I hope to visit. I do hope to keep my risk because those are pretty important for development. I've heard a lot. But yeah, you know, there's trade offs for wherever you go. That's something I've gotten a lot of appreciation for. And just like my Nomad time, you have to appreciate that. Also, you're a visitor in these countries. So like, what I'm speaking to is really like my small expat slice of a view on Mexico City and can be very different than a locals view. But one thing that I did feel is just a lot of love for the country from both like locals and expats and being there on the Mexican Independence Day. I think I felt that more strongly than any other time. So definitely recommend.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 I feel like you and I could buzz about travel forever. One more question, then we'll wrap up or what's the most underrated city you've ever been to?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Underrated? Ooh. Yeah, I feel like my favorites might be kind of mainstream. I think out of the places that I've been. The ones I've really loved are I mean, of course, Tokyo and Florence and Istanbul and Mexico City. I mean, in some ways MEXICO CITY I feel like it's still relatively undiscovered. But maybe I'll put a shout out for like, the more we call it Inaka. But like countryside regions of Japan, there are a lot of areas of Japan that are really just like not very traveled to everyone goes to like Tokyo, Kyoto, but I personally love the southern regions of Japan like Kyushu. Shikoku. Like Fukuoka is an incredibly well developed city that's actually like very easy to live out of like it's super affordable. It's beautiful. There's like a nice river that runs through. And for people who are actually local to Japan, they know that it has some of like the most incredible nature like hiking, scuba diving, surfing, like really whatever you want, and like and is incredible food or like really unique food and that the Americans probably love most is ramen. And that like really sort of like fatty, rich style of poem klutzy ramen originates in Fukuoka, at least in Kyushu. And so that's where you should go to get like the real stuff. I'll cost you like $3\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 How many languages do you speak by the way?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 I speak three conversationally I would say like Chinese Japanese and English and then I speak like Spanish and Italian well enough to like get by and you know, survive.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Interesting because yeah, the Japanese accent was very on there like see Yeah, effortless. All right, this has been incredible. Thank you so much. I have learned just an absolute shit ton pardon my French but I've learned yet to put that on your list of languages to learn. I've learned so much from you very grateful that you came on the show. This will be one that I will definitely be listening to on a walk. I hate hearing my own voice. But it will be nice listening to all of the knowledge bombs that you dropped. As a marketer myself, I have so much to learn about the fundamentals of design, user experiences you In finding, talking to people talking to users finding the solution to problems, this was a nice fire that was lighted or has been lit under my derriere. So thank you for that. Really appreciate it. And I definitely would love to have you on for round two. Until then, now, I wish you in the team all the best and before you go, can you please let our listeners know where they can find you and Orca online and on socials?\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Of course. Thank you so much, man. Yeah, I've done a fair number of podcasts. This is one of the most fun for sure. You can find Orca on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . It is at twitter.com/orca_so we are Orca_so on all channels so you can find links to discord telegram etc there and I'm also on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  as well usually tweeting really long tweet thread that I hope someone will eventually read. I am @oritheorca.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Alright, Ori, thank you so much for the treats really appreciate it and can't wait to have you on to the next one.\par \par \uc2 Ori Kwan\par \par \uc2 Thanks so much Matt. Have a good one.\par \par \uc2 Matt Zahab\par \par \uc2 Folks, what an incredible episode with Ori from Orca dropping absolute knowledge bombs left right and center we absolutely love to see it I know you guys will love this one. As always everything Orca related and Ori related will be in the show notes and this will be a long shownotes as well as there were tons of bombs dropped. Folks if you love this and I really hope you did please do subscribe it would mean the world to my team and I speaking of the team love you guys until the listeners you are all the GOATs keep on growing those bags and keep on staying healthy, wealthy and happy. Bye for now, and we will talk soon. All the best.\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020221011eiab000p1\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Why Moshnake Could Be Your Best Crypto to Buy Today Alongside Ethereum and Ellipsis\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 781 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 October 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Moshnake (MSH), Ethereum (ETH), and Ellipsis (EPS) are some of the best cryptocurrencies with the potential to help their holders survive the current crypto winter.\par \par \uc2 This article discusses what makes these cryptos worth holding and why they could be your best buy-ins, considering the condition of the market.\par \par \uc2 Moshnake: The Hot New Gaming Cryptocurrency\par \par \uc2 The GameFi community grew bigger with the introduction of NFT gaming and the Metaverse. Moshnake (MSH) breaks in as a new cryptocurrency gaming platform that is community-focused. The gaming platform also appeals to lovers of the classic Snake Xenzia game, with an incorporation of the play-to-earn (P2E) model.\par \par \uc2 Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Moshnake (MSH) is built for all age groups\u8212\'20\'14with everyone having access to play the game and connect with other players at any given time while earning. The game boasts a user-friendly interface and promotes competitiveness among players in its battle royale arena.\par \par \uc2 The Moshnake (MSH) token is the governance token of the community, with holders enjoying voting rights on important decisions concerning the project. Players also earn Venom tokens (VEN) as the in-game currency. Both of these are BEP-20 tokens expected to be valuable and interoperable across blockchain networks.\par \par \uc2 In addition, users will enjoy additional incentives, such as Moshnake (MSH) airdrops and listing in major exchanges for more accessibility.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum: The Smart Contract Cryptocurrency\par \par \uc2 Ethereum (ETH) is a decentralized blockchain for developing dApps, DAOs, and NFTs through smart contracts. It is the second most used and generally accepted cryptocurrency in the world. The network is built on the innovations of Bitcoin (BTC) to revolutionize traditional institutions, especially financial institutions.\par \par \uc2 The Ethereum blockchain is a hub for financial services, games, social networks, and apps with privacy preservation. Furthermore, the network is programmable, which is one of its greatest advantages over the Bitcoin network. This is because it allows for apps to be built that will utilize blockchain technology to store data and control their functionality.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum has Ether (ETH) as its native token. Ethereum users use Ether (ETH) to process and pay for transactions, gas fees on the network, and smart contracts.\par \par \uc2 Ether tokens (ETH) were formerly created through crypto mining. However, the network recently transitioned from its Proof-of-Work (PoW) mechanism to the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, eliminating mining. This transition aims to improve security, \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , and scalability while lessening the transaction fees on the Ethereum (ETH) network.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum (ETH) has proven to be a great buy for its users and shows no sign of slowing down. The value of Ether (ETH) rises based on its service as a transactional currency, a digital store of value for some users, a means of collateral for facilitating loans, and an investment for other crypto users.\par \par \uc2 Ellipsis: The DeFi Cryptocurrency\par \par \uc2 Ellipsis (EPS) is a crypto platform that acts as an automated market maker (AMM) to allow users and other decentralized platforms to trade various stablecoins with low spillage and minimal fees in the cryptocurrency market. The platform replaces the traditional market maker by making use of liquidity pools.\par \par \uc2 The EPS token serves as the native token of the platform. The major functions of the EPS token are to incentivize liquidity providers on the Ellipsis platform and allow users to participate in the distribution of incentives. Also, token holders provide liquidity and can earn staking rewards which they can withdraw or \u8216\'20\'18restake\u8217\'20\'19 to make more from the liquidity pool.\par \par \uc2 The platform plans to migrate its EPS tokens to EPX tokens \u8212\'20\'14 to increase the relative supply from 1 billion to 1.5 billion and its absolute total token supply to 132 billion tokens, an increment of about 88 times more.\par \par \uc2 As a fork of Curve Finance, hosted on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Ellipsis (EPS) better suits individuals seeking ways to swap their tokens or earn as liquidity providers. Conversely, Ellipsis (EPS) aims to offer efficient and well-priced swaps, an environmentally friendly yield to token holders, and a solution to building deep liquidity.\par \par \uc2 Through various offerings and incentives like token airdrops, cheaper transaction fees, and liquidity rewards, Moshnake (MSH), Ethereum (ETH), and Ellipsis (EPS) aim to reward token holders while increasing their market value in the cryptocurrency market.\par \par \uc2 To find out more about Moshnake (MSH), follow the links below:\par \par \uc2 Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://moshnake.io"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://moshnake.io}}}\par \par \uc2 Telegram: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/MoshnakeOfficial"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.me/MoshnakeOfficial}}}\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/moshnakeToken"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/moshnakeToken}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

\par\par \b \uc2 Why Investors Are Choosing Flasko (FLSK) Over Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) And Cardano (ADA)\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 476 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 October 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Due to the recent collapse of the cryptocurrency market, Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) and Cardano (ADA) may have recently seen large gains. For example, Cardano (ADA) could achieve a price hike of around 5% within a period of 24 hours.\par \par \uc2 But Flasko seems to dominate the presale, surpassing both currencies. All cryptocurrency aficionados should be aware that the Flasko presale is nearly completely sold out. In a cryptocurrency market where Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) prices have fallen by 77% and 75%, respectively, Flasko appears to be the most prominent investment opportunity to consider.\par \par \uc2 Solana (SOL) Expecting Greater Improvements In The Future\par \par \uc2 One of the most well-known decentralized cryptocurrencies out there is Solana (SOL). It has received a great deal of praise for its quickness, efficacy, and \uc2 sustainability\uc2 . The hybrid technology that underlies Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) has made a significant contribution to the aforementioned reality.\par \par \uc2 However, Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) has recently suffered from a few big attacks. Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) is anticipated to acquire greater momentum since the Solana(SOL) team is eager to provide fresh updates to tackle those weaknesses.\par \par \uc2 Cardano (ADA) Investors Are Looking For Alternative Investments\par \par \uc2 In the recent past, Cardano (ADA) could experience significant gains. However, it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t seem to be showing the potential that it had sometime back. Therefore, it will not be possible to see Cardano (ADA)delivering impressive returns to investors in 2022 or 2023.\par \par \uc2 All investors looking forward to getting significant returns are let down by Cardano (ADA), and now they are looking for alternative investments.\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) Is The Best Cryptocurrency Investment To Consider Now\par \par \uc2 Flasko is a cryptocurrency based on a unique idea. It offers an alternative investment opportunity, where cryptocurrency investors can invest in NFTs. The most unique thing about Flasko is that these NFTs are backed up with real-world luxurious beverages, such as luxury wine, premium champagne, and expensive whiskey. The concept is solid, and it is attracting investors from all around the world. Anyone who has an interest in whiskeys, champagnes, and rare wines may go for it.\par \par \uc2 The presale of Flasko is taking place as of now.

"There is traditional DeFi, we're still investing in that. There's the regulated DeFi [products], which is just emergent. And then there are the regions like Brazil, India, and Southeast Asia\u8212\'20\'14they just need the infrastructure to come online, so we're investing in that too."\par \par \uc2 One area that Framework Ventures has focused on is blockchain gaming. The firm earmarked $200 million for the blockchain gaming industry in April through its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/98173/framework-ventures-new-400-million-fund-bets-big-on-blockchain-gaming"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 FVIII fund}}}\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/98263/investors-poured-2-5b-crypto-games-q1-2022-report/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Investors Poured $2.5B Into Crypto Games in Q1 2022: Report}}}\par \par \uc2 "People are excited about [blockchain] games because they're all launching Q1 [2023]," Spencer said, adding that with so many games coming out at the same time, the industry is going to find out quickly if it is any good at game development.\par \par \uc2 "Gaming and DeFi are two things that we do very tactically, because large markets are immediately available and we have use cases that exist currently," Spencer said.\par \par \uc2 But that is easier said than done. The promotion of blockchain or Web3 gaming has outpaced its design capability, and many in the gaming community see it as nothing more than a cash grab at gamers' expense.\par \par \uc2 "The first iteration games were [like] Axie Infinity," Spencer said. "That was hyper-financialized, potentially financial napalm," he said, noting what he called "violent upswings and downswings" of the market. But Spencer says he is optimistic about the next six to 12 months as more traditional games studios build games on-chain.\par \par \uc2 "They probably won't have their own native token," he said. "Maybe they put NFTs on-chain, or have monetization, and have the virtual currency as tokens," but will be more grounded in reality.\par \par \uc2 As Spencer explained, one issue slowing the adoption of blockchain or Web3 games is that they are known as blockchain Web3 games. That label carries years of baggage, including a negative \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact.\par \par \uc2 "I think [not referencing blockchain or Web3] will be the recipe for success for the first iteration of games," Spencer said. "We're bringing on people who play traditional games, and you don't want to inundate them with too much blockchain."\par \par \uc2 Spencer went on to say that developers who use the blockchain to create better user and gaming experiences like virtual reality, augmented reality, and GPS-based games are the ones who will be successful.\par \par \uc2 "A lot of people look at the 1,000 DeFi protocols that didn't succeed and are a little bit disheartened, but I choose to see the 50 that did work," Spencer said. "You have to throw 1,000 startups at the wall for 50 to work."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/110865/crypto-gaming-will-bring-100-million-people-web3-framework-ventures-co-founder/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Crypto Gaming Will 'Bring 100 Million People Into Web3': Framework Ventures Co-Founder}}}\par \par \uc2 While regulation and the risk of driving blockchain innovation overseas is a concern, Spencer said he is optimistic that, in the end, it will create better investment opportunities.\par \par \uc2 "I feel [it] presents an opportunity; you're gonna have DeFi in its current form, but that will be more overseas," he said. "The [projects] in the U.S. are gonna have to fall into some regulatory jurisdiction."\par \par \uc2 DeFi\uc2  under regulatory oversight, Spencer explains, would be positive for the industry and will open it up to investors, the traditional banking system, and access to more capital.\par \par \uc2 "There's going be some growing pains," he says. "But the industry always needs to be changing and evolving and can't just be the same thing. And so we're pretty bullish on that. It's going to be a headache, but that's okay."\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Framework-Ventures-Decrypt-at-SmartCon-1-gID_5.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 View image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Document CRYP000020221010eiaa0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

Absolutely! Despite the regulatory upheavals, reasonable progress has been made. Is Bitcoin green now? No, but at least Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s greenhouse gas emissions are not where they used to be. According to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ccaf.io/cbeci/ghg/index"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index}}}\uc2 , Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s greenhouse gas emissions dropped from 59 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in October 2021 to 48.88 metric tons today.\par \par \uc2 However, parliamentarians now have their gaze fixed on the proof-of-work consensus mechanism and are pushing for bitcoin mining to go green.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s a known fact that Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s growing energy consumption has drawn criticism from environmentalists. Bitcoin miners must overcome the primordial sentiments that are often flung at emerging technologies that society seems initially uncomfortable with; consider \uc2 Western Union\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s internal memo from 1876: \u8220\'20\'1CThis 'telephone' has too many shortcomings to be seriously considered as a means of communication. The device is inherently of no value to us.\u8221\'20\'1D The sentiments have remained the same. One should not be surprised when bitcoin becomes a standard for future currencies.\par \par \uc2 Some may have expected that the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Paris Climate Agreement}}}\uc2  in 2015 would spur Bitcoin toward the more sustainable path of renewable energy. However, one shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be surprised by the apathy of Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s accusers concerning the positive gains recorded with its limiting of carbon dioxide emissions.\par \par \uc2 Is solar mining the answer to the Bitcoin energy problem? Partially. Optimizing available energy and expanding working options requires a multidimensional approach. Various strategies include load balancing, energy swaps, hybrid systems and additional battery storage. The multiplier effect of increased government subsidies \u8212\'20\'14 an incentivized effort to speed up green energy adoption \u8212\'20\'14 could further cut solar installation costs.\par \par \uc2 A general overview of these energy solutions and their adoption is provided below.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s Global Power Consumption\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinminingcouncil.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022.07.19-BMC-Presentation-Q2-22-Presentation.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 global power consumption}}}\uc2  stands at 253 TWh, approximately 0.15% of total global energy consumption. The Bitcoin network has achieved a more green power mix than Germany.\par \par \uc2 According to the \uc2 Bitcoin Mining Council\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s 2022 report, 59.5% of the total bitcoin mining global energy comes from renewable sources, which is a good sign of progress. The council further reported a 46% increase in efficiency on a year-on-year basis due to increased mining efficiency and improved semiconductor technology.\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s get a rough sense of the current cost of bitcoin mining.\par \par \uc2 What Is The Average Profitability Of Bitcoin Mining?\par \par \uc2 Taking the powerful and popular bitcoin miner Antminer S19 Pro, rated at 3250 watts, it {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.calculator.net/electricity-calculator.html?appliance=&power=3250&powerunit=W&capacity=100&usage=24&usageunit=hpd&price=0.1&x=31&y=20"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 will consume 78kWh daily}}}\uc2 . This will cost $7.80 per day, at the rate of $0.10 per kWh, this yields a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insights.braiins.com/en/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 loss of $0.11}}}\uc2 . This is not a good scenario.\par \par \uc2 Cooling cost and a 50% discharge limit for lithium-ion batteries could further ramp up the price to mine bitcoin due to usable capacity. However, profitability is primarily impacted by electricity cost and mining difficulty. With cheap electricity, mining remains profitable regardless of bitcoin price.\par \par \uc2 Solar mining and other viable hybrids provide excellent alternatives. Though an element of geography and capital seems to be an advantage to mining success.\par \par \uc2 Different options exist to fast-track the green energy revolution with numerous benefits for bitcoin mining. The potential is incredible when we look at other green energy sources, but let\u8217\'20\'19s get a glimpse of solar first.\par \par \uc2 Solar Energy And Mining Growth\par \par \uc2 Solar is now termed \u8220\'20\'1Cthe cheapest energy source.\u8221\'20\'1D The levelized cost of energy places {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/cheap-renewable-energy-vs-fossil-fuels/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 onshore wind and solar}}}\uc2  ahead of other energy sources.\par \par \uc2 As the energy source with the fastest growth rate, solar power today supplies around {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.c2es.org/content/renewable-energy/#:~:text=Solar%20photovoltaics%20are%20the%20fastest,percent%20of%20the%20world's%20electricity."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 3% of the world\u8217\'20\'19s electricity}}}\uc2 , producing zero noise pollution while possessing high scalability. Unlike relatively scarce geothermal, solar has worldwide potential.\par \par \uc2 The deployment of solar in conjunction with bitcoin mining continues to gain traction among entrepreneurs. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://acdigitalcorp.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Aspen Creek Digital Corp}}}\uc2 ., a new bitcoin mining firm, has begun mining at a 6 megawatt (MW) solar-powered plant in western Colorado amid the current bear market.\par \par \uc2 However, wind and solar are significantly utilized in Texas, a booming place for bitcoin mining.\par \par \uc2 According to Shaun Connell, Executive VP of Power at Houston-based tech company Lancium, \u8220\'20\'1CYou get this perfect overlap with both sun quality and wind speed in West Texas.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Texas will continue to play a vital role in the green energy market. However, China remains a global leader in solar manufacturing and total installed capacity, contributing 15.4% of non-fossil fuels to its energy mix with a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/china-says-third-electricity-will-come-renewables-by-2025-2022-06-01/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 target of 33%}}}\uc2  by 2025.\par \par \uc2 Photovoltaic panels and solar radiation-concentrating mirrors are increasingly being used to harness solar energy as technology continues to advance.\par \par \uc2 Biomass Deployment In Bitcoin Mining\par \par \uc2 Biomass accounts for approximately {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/9444/iea-task40-biomass-provides-10-percent-of-global-energy-use"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 10% of the world\u8217\'20\'19s energy}}}\uc2 , 5% of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 U.S. primary consumption}}}\uc2  and 1.4% of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/energy-sources-distribution/renewable-energy/about-renewable-energy/7295"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 electricity generated in Canada}}}\uc2 . The bulk of this energy is used for heating and other industrial processes, which has significant \uc2 environmental\uc2  advantages that extend to improving hygiene by recycling waste materials and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\par \par \uc2 In the race to a sustainable bitcoin mining industry, using biodegradable materials as fuel for electricity production is not out of place. It may not provide a more significant arbitrage when paired against solar, but investing in these energy alternatives from an advantage remains the best.\par \par \uc2 Generation Hemp\uc2  just partnered with Cryptic Solutions in an attempt to utilize hemp as biofuel to run its mining hardware. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://globalcannabistimes.com/burning-up-biomass-for-bitcoin-mining/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As reported in an article}}}\uc2 , \uc2 Generation Hemp\uc2  Chairman and CEO \uc2 Gary Evans\uc2  said:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe decided that the ideal place to initiate our first green bitcoin mining operation was right in our own backyard. We are located in an industrial park of western Kentucky with ample low-cost electric availability and a very friendly business environment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Using biodegradable waste from farms to generate electricity to mine bitcoin is an interesting way to economically deploy otherwise wasted materials that could be a source of land and water contamination, but instead creates carbon dioxide emissions when these resources are now used for mining bitcoin. It is likely that using these types of biowaste materials for bitcoin mining will be more impactful for society by preventing health issues that arise with contamination than the carbon dioxide emissions they create. That being said, scalability of these solutions remains a significant concern.\par \par \uc2 Can Bitcoin Be Mined With Wind Energy?\par \par \uc2 With a 25-year service life for wind turbines, it is more rewarding for bitcoin mining than solar power when maintenance is considered.\par \par \uc2 Wind speed, air density and swept area serve as reminders that location is crucial when it comes to wind energy. Constrained by the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Betz_limit#:~:text=The%20Betz%20limit%20is%20the,the%20turbine%20and%20generate%20electricity."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Betz Limit}}}\uc2 , engineers have been exploring design options that provide the best optimization of wind turbine efficiency while reducing cost. Horizontal axis turbines are standard. However, bladeless turbine concepts are gaining ground, though they can\u8217\'20\'19t be seen as significant competitors.\par \par \uc2 Wind power designs are experiencing accelerated improvement in design efficiency {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/environment/world-largest-wind-turbine-power-ge-haliade-x-massachusetts-usa-531525.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 and capacity}}}\uc2 . Implementing more wind-powered mining systems will improve the renewable energy mix of bitcoin mining. However, wind power suffers the same fate as solar and will require batteries for shortfalls during less windy periods. Also, it\u8217\'20\'19s best scaled by adding energy to the grid in a distributed model.\par \par \uc2 Wind energy is efficient, inexhaustible and affordable. Wind energy is the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/advantages-and-challenges-wind-energy#:~:text=Wind%20is%20a%20domestic%20source,power%20in%20the%20United%20States."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 largest renewable power source}}}\uc2  in the United States and growing. However, if not carefully planned, wind installations create noise and pose \uc2 environmental\uc2  concerns.\par \par \uc2 Hydropower And Bitcoin Mining?\par \par \uc2 Hydropower has the highest energy {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/hydroelectric-power"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 extraction (conversion) efficiency}}}\uc2  of up to 90%, the highest among renewable energy options, the most reliable and it maintains the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-NB-1754"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 lowest carbon footprint}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Alps Blockchain, an Italian startup, is one firm that has deployed the use of hydropower for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/miningweek/2022/03/25/how-northern-italian-hydropower-producers-became-bitcoin-miners/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bitcoin mining in Borgo d\u8217\'20\'19Anaunia.}}}\uc2  With an energy firm struggling to cover its facility maintenance costs, it was easy for Alps Blockchain to purchase more than 40 state-of-the-art ASIC miners at a cheaper rate and resell the computing power worldwide.\par \par \uc2 Hydropower is stable and affordable. It remains one of the earliest and most adopted energy sources. It accounts for over {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.power-technology.com/features/featurethe-worlds-most-used-renewable-power-sources-4160168/#:~:text=Hydropower%20is%20the%20most%20widely,global%20renewable%20power%20generation%20capacity."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 18% of global power}}}\uc2  generation and is the most stable mining option requiring no backups. It\u8217\'20\'19s worth noting that great apathy exists among engineers and scientists when referring to hydropower as renewable, considering its \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact.\par \par \uc2 Load Balancing Of Renewable Options\par \par \uc2 Incentivized load curtailment at peak demand periods will continue in an attempt to flatten losses. Miners\u8217\'20\'19 involvement remains relevant, but wholesale prices have fallen due to the solar value deflation caused by the time-locked supply of solar energy, resulting in utilities paying less for solar.\par \par \uc2 The growing market for electric cars and the Bitcoin network offer profitable alternatives to the industry\u8217\'20\'19s solar value decline. Solar bitcoin mining could reduce solar value deflation to a great extent while reducing the need for generated energy curtailment, at the same time freeing up power during peak demand, especially when grid-dependent backups are incorporated.\par \par \uc2 Long Distance Energy Swap\par \par \uc2 Superconducting commercial direct current (DC) power transmission will reduce significant losses in realizing underwater long-distance power transmission (intercontinental level inclusive). High-voltage DC use has recorded both success and failure in this ambitious attempt. A recent popular project is the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.pv-tech.org/australian-power-export-project-will-unlock-solars-potential-developer-sun-cable-says/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Australian-Singapore}}}\uc2  (ASEAN) solar power line.\par \par \uc2 Time-limited solar and other seasonal energy resources with tremendous abundance could be swapped between regions with similar characteristics having opposite availability periods.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s important to note that long-distance energy swaps pose a significant security risk when used as a primary power source if maintenance and emergencies are taken into account. These same systems have tremendous advantages when used as backup power.\par \par \uc2 One illustration is Denmark and Norway\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://industryeurope.com/sectors/energy-utilities/pumped-hydropower-the-green-battery/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pumped water storage}}}\uc2 , which provides energy for Denmark when there is no wind. It\u8217\'20\'19s interesting how Norway\u8217\'20\'19s mountainous water resources complement Denmark\u8217\'20\'19s high seasonal winds.\par \par \uc2 Increased Storage To Optimize Solar Mining\par \par \uc2 Technological improvements have helped offset solar value depreciation, especially in batteries.\par \par \uc2 The decentralized nature of Bitcoin makes it an advantage to have intermittent power supplies added to the network, which makes it profitable for the energy grid and investors at the same time while also maintaining a decentralized ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 Battery scaling has become the go-to choice for miners seeking to reap the full benefits of their investments. \uc2 Blockstream\uc2  and payment firm Block have partnered with \uc2 Tesla\uc2  to construct an entirely off-grid, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/08/tesla-block-blockstream-to-mine-bitcoin-off-solar-power-in-texas.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 bitcoin mining facility}}}\uc2  using renewable energy. This includes deploying 3.8 MW of solar panels with four \uc2 Tesla\uc2  Megapack battery units.\par \par \uc2 Continuous Increase In Bitcoin Mining Efficiency\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s carbon footprint is dropping drastically as mining efficiency continues to improve on a recorded 63% year-over-year basis. According to the \uc2 Bitcoin Mining Council\uc2 , a six-fold improvement is expected with the Bitcoin protocol and efficiency in mining within the next eight years.\par \par \uc2 Final Thoughts\par \par \uc2 A hybrid renewable energy system has proven greater efficiency in electricity production, which can only mean more profitability for mining. With perfect geography, the solar-wind hybrid system is sustainable.\par \par \uc2 The combined impact of technological advancement, government subsidies and hybrid renewable systems can trigger the transition to green energy at a breakneck speed. Utilizing energy balancing techniques, curtailment and increased storage will put the lid on mitigating the inefficiency in expending available power, support efforts to combat \uc2 climate change\uc2  and pave the way for greater profitability in bitcoin mining.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Jerry Usman.

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 Legacy investment management firm, \uc2 Abrdn\uc2  has joined the Hedera Governing Council as it looks to deepen its foothold in the digital currency and blockchain ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 According to Duncan Moir, senior investment manager at \uc2 Abrdn\uc2 , who spoke in an interview with the Block, the firm is focused on tokenization as it wants to explore new trading capabilities for its investors.\par \par \uc2 As a member of the Hedera Governing Council, \uc2 Abrdn\uc2  will {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/singapore-based-dbs-bank-joins-hedera-hashgraphs-governing-council"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 join}}}\uc2  the likes of DBS, \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 IBM\uc2  and Standard Chartered, amongst others, to run nodes for the Hedera protocol and shape the future of the protocol by being a part of its decision-making process. \uc2 Abrdn\uc2  was integrated as a governing council member based on its significant interest and belief that blockchain is the next frontier in tech.\par \par \uc2 "We're really long-term investors," Moir, senior investment manager at \uc2 Abrdn\uc2 , said in the interview. "We see this as being a very long-term story for us and for the industry."\par \par \uc2 Blockchain technology is most renowned as a revolutionary tool to revamp the investment world. Moir is confident in the enterprise's capabilities of the Hedera protocol and is ready to explore its capabilities to meet its long-term goals.\par \par \uc2 "I don't think anybody is really, let's say, full service. They're very much focused on specific things, and they've been dipping their toes in," Moir said of the capabilities of the blockchain-linked solution. "We want to go about it a bit more comprehensively."\par \par \uc2 The choice of Hedera as the base protocol to advance its push is hinged on the \uc2 sustainability\uc2  of the protocol. Notably, Hedera Hashgraph was rated as the most sustainable protocol ahead of Algorand, Cardano, and Ethereum by researchers at the \uc2 University College London (UCL)\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 While Hedera has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/lg-launches-nft-platform-with-hedera-blockchain"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 made a name for itself}}}\uc2  in the enterprise world, it will need much more integrations like that being offered by \uc2 Abrdn\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020221010eiaa0000o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal600

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 For accurate futuristic decision-making in weather forecasting, blockchain ledgers should be integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT), {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.prweb.com/releases/integration_of_blockchain_ledgers_with_ai_and_iot_achieves_wonders_in_forecasting_including_weather_prediction_raj_chowdhury/prweb18942364.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  according }}}\uc2  to HashCash Consultants CEO \uc2 Raj Chowdhury\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Chowdhury stated:\par \par \uc2 Widespread proliferation of IoT sensors has successfully established its uses across the weather departments, while AI/ML is being used for forecasting. The last remaining thing is establishing trust in the data's accuracy- which is something blockchain excels at with consensus protocols, immutability, and transparency.\par \par \uc2 Since weather departments collect huge amounts of data needed for forecasting, blockchain technology can come in handy in accumulating weather-centric parameters, such as humidity, wind direction, temperature, and atmospheric pressure. This information can come in handy for logistics shipping and agriculture companies.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, a decentralized blockchain ledger can render real-time transaction visibility. Chowdhury added:\par \par \uc2 Reliable information has always been critical to success. The ongoing age of digital transformation may have revolutionized the way we acquire data, but everything is left to chance without validation. This is exactly why all top organizations in the world are already using blockchain.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  (\uc2 WEF\uc2 ) recently established a Crypto \uc2 Sustainability\uc2  Coalition to investigate the capability of Web3 and blockchain in tackling \uc2 climate change\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/wef-launches-coalition-to-deal-with-climate-change-through-web3.0"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  Blockchain.News }}}\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 WEF\uc2  noted that blockchain tools would propel transparency in the worldwide carbon credits market, whereas crypto mining would trigger renewable microgrids through off-peak demand and decentralization.\par \par \uc2 On the other hand, a report by Chainlink Labs and Tecnalia {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/blockchain-can-improve-climate-crisis-through-smart-contracts-study-shows"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2  noted }}}\uc2  that blockchain technology could help fight the climate crisis through smart contracts. As a result, blockchain was expected to act as a stepping stone towards addressing economic complexities and interoperability when transiting to renewable energy.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020221010eiaa00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Likely to overtake Apecoin (APE) and Solana (SOL)\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 489 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 October 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Upon the recent failure of the crypto market, Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) and Apecoin (APE) could experience significant gains in the recent past. However, Flasko appears to be the presale powerhouse, overtaking both those coins. The presale of Flasko is almost sold out, and it is certainly something that all cryptocurrency enthusiasts should keep in mind as of now.\par \par \uc2 Investors are confident in the growth of Apecoin (APE)\par \par \uc2 After the crypto market drop, Apecoin could secure a growth of 16%. This was a significant increase in value, and the coin could reach above $5. Even though Bitcoin is still around the $20,000 mark, it is quite impressive to see the growth of Apecoin. However, crypto analysts also believe that the growth of Apecoin will not take place steadily. This is based upon the way it behaved in the recent past.\par \par \uc2 Bigger upgrades to happen in the Solana (SOL) community\par \par \uc2 Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ) is among the most prominent decentralized cryptocurrencies available out there. It has gained a lot of positive attention for speed, effectiveness, as well as \uc2 sustainability\uc2 . The hybrid technology behind Solana has contributed a lot towards the above-mentioned fact. However, the cryptocurrency was a victim of few significant hacks in the recent past. Since the team behind Solana is looking forward to introducing new upgrades to overcome those vulnerabilities, this coin is expected to gain more traction in future.\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) appears to be the most prominent cryptocurrency out of all\par \par \uc2 The popularity of Flasko as a cryptocurrency is increasing along with time. The unique concept behind this cryptocurrency has contributed a lot towards the above-mentioned fact as well. In a market where cryptocurrency investors are looking forward to investing their money in alternative investments, Flasko is gaining a lot of attention.\par \par \uc2 Along with Flasko, cryptocurrency investors now have the freedom to go ahead and invest their money in exquisite wines, expensive champagne, as well as rare whiskeys. It will be possible for them to secure outstanding profits against rising values. According to the analysis reports of cryptocurrency experts, the Flasko project has gone through an audit with Solid Proof.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, it will be locking up the liquidity for a duration of over 30 years. Due to all these reasons, the presale of tokens is almost sold out. Anyone who is still looking to grab this opportunity should take a look at it. As of now, the tokens are being sold at just $0.05 each, but it will significantly rise along with time.\par \par \uc2 Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://flasko.io"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://flasko.io}}}\par \par \uc2 Presale: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://presale.flasko.io"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://presale.flasko.io}}}\par \par \uc2 Telegram: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/flaskoio"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.me/flaskoio}}}\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/flasko_io"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/flasko_io}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

ESG investments could reach tens of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/blog/esg-assets-may-hit-53-trillion-by-2025-a-third-of-global-aum/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 trillions}}}\uc2  of dollars in the next decades.\par \par \uc2 Blockchains aiming for carbon neutrality \u8211\'20\'13 a big win for ESG\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin introduced us to blockchain, and its success is built on the network security maintained by its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-work/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Proof-of-Work (PoW)}}}\uc2  mining consensus mechanism. It requires large amounts of computing power, and thus electricity, to verify transactions in order to add new blocks to the chain.\par \par \uc2 Since the first Bitcoin block was mined, the crypto industry has improved technologically and produced more eco-friendly blockchain solutions. For instance, PoW-to-PoS transition is key to greener tech.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/proof-of-stake/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Proof-of-Stake (PoS)}}}\uc2  is a more sustainable consensus process than PoW. To verify transactions and add new blocks, PoS validators stake their currencies. This reduces electricity use and carbon emissions. Block rewards are divided among node validators, with higher-staked validators having a better chance. Even {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum (ETH)}}}\uc2 , the second-largest crypto asset, has {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/ethereum-merge-live-latest-news-updates.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 switched}}}\uc2  to PoS.\par \par \uc2 Many of the earlier Layer-1 blockchains are slow, have high transaction fees, and leave a larger \uc2 environmental\uc2  footprint than is acceptable.\par \par \uc2 All the top developers are working on cutting-edge protocols to solve Ethereum co-founder {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/vitalik-buterin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Vitalik Buterin}}}\uc2  's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/blockchain-trilemma"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 blockchain trilemma}}}\uc2 , which is how to balance security, speed, and scalability. When all blockchains accomplish this, the earth will benefit.\par \par \uc2 One of the major challenges for massive blockchain adoption is scalability\par \par \uc2 As blockchain adoption grows, most networks' designs create operational bottlenecks that stop them from growing. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/layer-2"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Layers 2}}}\uc2 , which combine transactions and send them back to Layer 1, are one of the most common ways to fix this problem. This speeds up the process and frees up block space.\par \par \uc2 Many of these Layer 2s are also better for the environment. For example, validators use about 0.00079TWh of electricity per year, while Bitcoin - the biggest PoW chain - consumes ~ {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index/comparisons"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 9,000TWh}}}\uc2 . There is a big difference.\par \par \uc2 Scalability is a problem for both Proof-of-Stake and Proof-of-Work networks. Bitcoin, which, after the Ethereum Merge, is the only major chain that still uses PoW, has solutions for scaling up that also minimize power consumption.\par \par \uc2 For example, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/lightning-network/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Lighting}}}\uc2 , which is used in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/el-salvador/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 El Salvador}}}\uc2  to scale daily Bitcoin transactions, can grow in a way that is not proportional to how much energy it uses.\par \par \uc2 This minimizes the required energetic input. Energy optimization goes hand in hand with scalability, which is needed to expand the use of blockchain technology.\par \par \uc2 Proof-of-stake is not the only sustainable consensus mechanism\par \par \uc2 PoW and PoS are the most widely used consensus algorithms. However, PoS is not the only consensus mechanism that does not require a lot of energy. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/proof-of-authority-explained"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Proof-of-Authority}}}\uc2  (PoA) takes advantage of the value of identities. This means that block validators don't stake coins, but rather their reputations. PoA doesn't require mining or any specific amount of energy (besides to be operative).\par \par \uc2 Its technical architecture allows high transparency and speed, making POA a pretty good solution for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-authority-algorithm-use-cases-grow-from-pharma-to-games"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 logistics}}}\uc2  applications (supply chain).\par \par \uc2 Consequently, it is the consensus mechanism used by veChain, the most relevant crypto protocol applied to logistics. PoS is a more efficient consensus mechanism for other types of use cases such as decentralized finance ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/defi/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 DeFi}}}\uc2  ), non-fungible tokens ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/non-fungible-tokens/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 NFTs}}}\uc2  ), or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/gaming/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 GameFi}}}\uc2  because of its lower barriers to entry, reduced hardware requirements, etc.\par \par \uc2 Many of the methods blockchain can be utilized to solve problems are ESG compliant.\par \par \uc2 Looking forward\par \par \uc2 Global blockchain leaders are reducing carbon emissions. According to research by the \uc2 Bitcoin Mining Council\uc2 , the worldwide Bitcoin mining sector would use {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/exclusives/ripples-exec-campaign-has-zero-chance-of-forcing-bitcoin-to-proof-of-stake-but-brace-for-more-attacks.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 58.5%}}}\uc2  renewable energy by Q4 2021. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/coins/binance-coin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 BNB Chain}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/coins/avax-avalanche/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Avalanche}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/coins/near-near-protocol/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Near Protocol}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/coins/algo-algorand/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Algorand}}}\uc2 , and other public chains are continually upgrading their technology to enhance efficiency and minimize emissions.

\par\par \b \uc2 How Incorporating Bitcoin Into Architecture Could Revolutionize Sustainable Living\b0\par\par\uc2 999 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 October 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 This is an opinion editorial by Makoto Shibuya, a licensed architect with an accomplished portfolio of personal and professional projects.\par \par \uc2 Introduction\par \par \uc2 I tend to believe that every challenge is also an opportunity. Cities developed over centuries, but the world is changing quickly. Though there is a healthy debate about what a future city may look like, if we were to design a city knowing what we know now, we can presume they would look quite different.\par \par \uc2 Architecture is difficult, complicated and rooted in a lot of history and tradition. Yet, it is one of our oldest practices \u8212\'20\'14 we needed a roof over our heads before we could sit and think about anything else. Unfortunately, this combination of complexity, tradition and permanence has historically kept the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry at the mercy of changing technology rather than its forefront. Change is difficult, especially for something built on centuries of precedent.\par \par \uc2 Whether we like it or not, that will have to change as the world recognizes what some have been warning about for decades. Though the numbers are evolving, we know {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.worldgbc.org/sites/default/files/2018%20GlobalABC%20Global%20Status%20Report.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 buildings collectively contribute about 40% of global CO2 emissions.}}}\par \par \uc2 Thesis\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin introduces a market-based economic incentive for net-positive energy projects, which in addition to reducing CO2 emissions, could help offset the embodied carbon of our infrastructure over time.\par \par \uc2 A Case Study\par \par \uc2 In 1945, the \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_Study_Houses"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Case Study House Program}}}\uc2  \u8221\'20\'1D was commissioned to help reimagine housing after World War II. While some of the projects were never built, it was an important and influential contribution to the modern architecture movement. Today, we face a different challenge \u8212\'20\'14 we know buildings collectively contribute about 40% of global CO2 emissions.\par \par \uc2 Zero is a case study to explore new opportunities around renewable energy infrastructure and Bitcoin. The ultimate goal is to accelerate net-zero carbon projects through renewable energy technology, material selection and carbon removal strategies. I understand there are many nuances around \uc2 environmental\uc2  concerns, and I am merely flexing some design ideas to see where I land.\par \par \uc2 On its face, the energy consumption of a \u8220\'20\'1Cproof-of-work\u8221\'20\'1D system like Bitcoin may seem like an inherent problem, but complex issues require looking at the entire system. When thinking about this, it is important to decouple energy from carbon emissions. Energy use is not intrinsically a bad thing. Everything requires energy \u8212\'20\'14 it is part of the first law of thermodynamics.\par \par \uc2 In summary, the problem with energy has never been about scarcity but rather intermittency, storage and distribution. For the first time in history, energy has a buyer of last resort \u8212\'20\'14 bitcoin miners \u8212\'20\'14 that can take stranded or surplus energy from anywhere and convert it into a global digital asset. Mining bitcoin introduces a perpetual appetite for stranded, or surplus, energy which can augment traditional net metering and energy storage. Mining makes it possible to monetize the buildout and operation of a solar system from day one rather than waiting for permits to sell back to the grid, which can often take months. It is another valuable tool that is geographically independent. This new demand acts as a continuous inducement for renewable energy and further innovation in energy infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Combining renewable energy sources with batteries enables people to be their own utility. Mining could add another tool to help balance their renewable energy economics. This additional utility lets households, campuses and cities design a renewable energy system that will meet all of their power needs without the risk of overbuilding. Traditionally, this has been uneconomical because the system needed to be designed for peak loads. This new ability to economically design for these extended loads, in turn, continues to improve the economics of renewable energy infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Energy Management\par \par \uc2 Below is a diagram showing how {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/bitcoin-mining"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mining bitcoin}}}\uc2  could complement energy storage and net metering. The heat generated by the mining hardware is then used to pre-heat domestic water used around the house.\par \par \uc2 Waste Heat\par \par \uc2 The waste heat (a by-product of mining bitcoin) is used to pre-heat domestic water around the house. In the winter, it is also used as radiant heat for the floor.\par \par \uc2 Solar Energy\par \par \uc2 "Capturing just one hour of the sunshine that hits our planet would enable us to meet the world's food and energy needs for an entire year, and each year the sun radiates more energy onto the earth than has been used in the whole of human history."{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Revolution-bottled-sunshine-Guardian-ebook/dp/B00LI1LACW/ref=sr_1_14?crid=1CQW18A2HFY83&keywords=the+solar+revolution&qid=1664404269&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjAwIiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&s=books&sprefix=the+solar+revolution%2Cstripbooks%2C152&sr=1-14"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 The Solar Revolution}}}\par \par \uc2 Sun Angle\par \par \uc2 The roof could be designed to cut off the sun angle in the summer and allow it to seep in during the winter. In the summer, this helps control the temperature from overheating. In the winter, the sun is allowed to heat the floor and radiate heat throughout the space over the course of the night. Adjustable sliding shades provide another level of local sun control.\par \par \uc2 Rain\par \par \uc2 Rainwater is collected into a water feature and stored in an underground water cistern. In the summer, as this water evaporates, it pre-cools the air before entering the building. Combining this with strategically located operable windows allows cool air to cross-ventilate through the residence, saving energy on air conditioning.\par \par \uc2 The Power Of An Image\par \par \uc2 After World War II, the original \u8220\'20\'1CCase Study Houses\u8221\'20\'1D appeared in the \u8220\'20\'1CArts & Architecture\u8221\'20\'1D magazine in iconic black and white photographs. These photographs spread California's mid-century architecture around the world and were influential to the modern architecture movement. In a similar spirit, I have created several images capturing project Zero to help paint a vision. It is not yet a complete picture \u8212\'20\'14 it is merely a case study to test ideas. Admittedly, there are details to work out and improvements to be made. However, the intention is to have an ongoing process to test ideas in hopes of a sustainable future.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Makoto Shibuya.

However, the current bear market is the longest cryptocurrency has experienced in its history, with the most significant coins experiencing a price reduction.\par \par \uc2 It has led many users to believe another dip is imminent, which appears to be a regular occurrence in 2022. However, this offers a positive side as low prices and careful research by an astute investor can lead to bulk purchases of specific tokens that, when the market eventually reaches that bullish turn, will explode in massive PR.\par \par \uc2 Polkadot (DOT) Didn\u8217\'20\'19t Have A Great Run In The Last Few Weeks\par \par \uc2 An open-source layer-zero blockchain technology called Polkadot (DOT), fueled by the Polkadot (DOT) utility token, enables communication and data sharing between blockchains and decentralized (dApps) applications (assets and data).\par \par \uc2 Although critical blockchain networks like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have thrived in their sectors, there is no compatibility.

In contrast to Ethereum, which has several problems, including slow transaction speeds, high gas costs, and an unfriendly attitude toward \uc2 climate change\uc2 , Polygon (MATIC) breezes past all of these problems. One is that the team is taking steps to be more environmentally friendly in the future.\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) Presale Continues To Make A Buzz\par \par \uc2 Flasko intends to be the first investment platform that enables its users to invest in exclusive and expensive spirits, premium wines, and vintage champagne NFTs supported by real-world use cases.\par \par \uc2 The trillion-dollar market for pricey wines, rare whiskeys, and exquisite champagnes is now open to you by investing in Flasko tokens for just $0.05.\par \par \uc2 Flasko has locked liquidity for 33 years, making investing in Flasko a much safer and more sustainable decision for investors.

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 Crypto miner Greenridge Generation is on a mission to raise up to $22.8 million.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 US Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  (SEC) filing dated October 3 showed that the firm seeks to do so in an at-the-market offering.\par \par \uc2 The US-based bitcoin mining company has signed a sales deal with B. Riley Securities for the Class A common stock offer, which will give the investment bank up to 5% of the gross proceeds from the offer.\par \par \uc2 In the filing, Greenridge wrote, "we (the company) currently plan to use the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting \uc2 B. Riley\uc2 's commissions and offering expenses payable by us, for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, paying or refinancing all or a portion of our indebtedness at the time, and funding acquisitions, capital expenditures and working capital."\par \par \uc2 In March, the bitcoin mining company had secured $100 million in funds to help enlarge its operations in the US.\par \par \uc2 The total sum included $81.4 million as a loan from an affiliate of NYDIG and $26.5 million as a promissory note with a \uc2 B. Riley Financial, Inc\uc2  cohort.\par \par \uc2 Even though Greenridge announced that its mining production increased by about 18% in June, it is seemingly looking to raise funds as it reported a second-quarter loss of $107.9 million.\par \par \uc2 According to its monthly operating update from June, Greenridge said it produced approximately 230 Bitcoins, an increase of about 18%, compared to 195 Bitcoins it mined in May.\par \par \uc2 The miner disclosed that it increased its hashrate capacity to 2.5 exahash per second ("EH/s") from 27,500 mining machines in June, an increase from 1.7 EH/s of mining capacity from 20,400 mining machines in the previous month.\par \par \uc2 Greenridge stated that it ordered an additional 200 mining machines, which are in transit, as they will be installed upon their arrival.\par \par \uc2 Following the company's second-quarter losses, it announced in August that it would pause its expansion plans in Texas. It cited a "sudden change in mining economics" and said it would focus on its South Carolina and New York locations.\par \par \uc2 However, the \uc2 New York Department of \uc2 Environmental\uc2  Conservation\uc2  denied the bitcoin mining company's air permit renewal in June as it did not meet the requirements of state climate laws.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, \uc2 NYSDEC\uc2  said that Greenridge's application was inconsistent with the climate goals highlighted by the state's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA), which focuses on reducing New York's greenhouse gas emission by at least 85% by 2050.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020221007eia700002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Big Eyes Coin Will Be Accepted to Tier 1 Exchange, Is This A Sign It Can Beat Floxi Inu & Doge Dash?\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 634 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 October 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 This cute cat has been gripping the hearts and minds of investors ever since it opened for presale. Several weeks later, three stages passed, over $3.92 million already raised, and Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is making a serious name for itself.\par \par \uc2 Another win for this adorable feline is that it will be released to tier one crypto exchange, CEX.io, once the Big Eyes Coin (BIG) presale is over. A tier 1 cryptocurrency exchange listing with good customer reviews will generate further trust in Big Eyes Coin\u8217\'20\'19s credibility and thus encourage investments.\par \par \uc2 Although Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is experiencing an unprecedented amount of presale success, does it have what it takes to challenge Floxi Inu (FLOXI) and Doge Dash (DOGEDASH)?\par \par \uc2 Floxi Inu Has Not Returned To Its Peak\par \par \uc2 A meme currency created after Elon Musk tweeted that the name of his Shiba Inu dog would be Floki, Floxi Inu aims to put real-world utility and charity into the meme token space.\par \par \uc2 Unfortunately, this token is quite volatile. It took a couple of months from its initial release to reach its all-time highest price, however, by 2022, this has dropped by more than half. In the last month alone, the price of Floxi Inu (FLOXI) has fallen even further.\par \par \uc2 Doge Dash Is Showing Promise This Week\par \par \uc2 Doge Dash (DOGEDASH) is a fun and colourful cryptocurrency which is mainly utilised in a play-to-earn, Super Mario-inspired game named Doge Dash. There are ten levels to play through. Users who perform well will appear on a daily leaderboard. Every day, 100 of the best performing players will be rewarded with tokens.\par \par \uc2 Although, upon release its price grew, shortly later, the value already began to drop. Currently, Doge Dash (DOGEDASH) is experiencing a seven-day upward trend, however, it is unclear whether this will continue when the likes of competitor Tamadoge (TAMA) are performing much better.\par \par \uc2 Is Big Eyes Coin A Serious Contender For Floxi Inu And Doge Dash?\par \par \uc2 Based on the data from Big Eyes Coin\u8217\'20\'19s presale, this cute cat is selling at an alarming rate. Part of this sales rush is being generated by the dedicated 5% of all Big Eyes tokens towards a marketing wallet. The result of this dedicated marketing budget can be seen in the growing social media handles and influencer endorsements by crypto influences Ieda Wobeto (@iedawobetoreal) and Rafa (@RafaaCerro). But there are other sources for Big Eyes Coin\u8217\'20\'19s surprising success.\par \par \uc2 One of the purposes of Big Eyes\u8217\'20\'19 creation was to raise awareness about oceanic environments. In the cat\u8217\'20\'19s terms, \u8220\'20\'1Csave the fish. So we can eat the fish\u8221\'20\'1D. A dedicated charity wallet has been created so that 5% of the total tokens available at launch can be sent to ocean sanctuaries. Recent publications, including a \uc2 UK government\uc2  study, have also highlighted that around 75% of the adult sample claimed they were worried about \uc2 climate change\uc2 . If this is true, then Big Eyes is speaking to people's concerns.\par \par \uc2 But perhaps the most dominant reason why Big Eyes Coin (BIG) is a competitor to Floxi Inu (FLOXI) and Doge Dash (DOGEDASH) is that, unlike other presale cryptocurrencies, Big Eyes has plans on how to sustain its growth in the long run: a strong community, social media following, NFT collections, Merchandise and events. This all forms the package which will make Big Eyes Coin (BIG) this year's promising cryptocurrency.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bigeyes.space/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://bigeyes.space/}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Additionally, the legislation imposes capital requirements for the aforementioned service providers. The capital requirements are expected to prevent depegging events such as was seen with the downfall of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/terra-collapse-teaches-about-crypto-and-bitcoin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Terra}}}\uc2  ecosystem, as well as preventing other major liquidity issues.\par \par \uc2 While the full text of the legislation is currently sealed, the bill is expected to be covered by the \uc2 EU\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s official journal before it would go into effect in 2024.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 EU\uc2  has also placed bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at the forefront of its agenda for the upcoming \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  (\uc2 IMF\uc2 ) and \uc2 World Bank\uc2  annual meeting, per a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-05/eu-puts-crypto-at-top-of-list-for-imf-meetings-mcguinness-says"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bloomberg}}}\uc2  report.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe have a crowded agenda for the US next week, and one of the items that won\u8217\'20\'19t be at the bottom of the list, it will be in there right around the top is crypto,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Mairead McGuinness\uc2 , \uc2 EU\uc2  commissioner for financial services.\par \par \uc2 With the looming implementation of MiCA, the \uc2 EU\uc2  will be the first attempt globally at creating a regulatory framework at this scale.

\par\par \b \uc2 Assassin\u8217\'20\'19s Creed\u8221\'20\'1D Game Director Sheds Light on Blockchain Gaming\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 1,340 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 The gaming world is filled with a myriad of pioneering figures who helped shape the industry into what it is today. These are people who are willing to push the boundaries of gaming whilst also understanding and satisfying their audience along the process. One of these figures is Marc Albinet, a true veteran of the industry. Albinet joined the gaming world during its inception in 1988, where he began his career at \uc2 Ubisoft\uc2 . One of the first games he worked on was Unreal (1990), a genre-fusing game that incorporated side-scrolling levels along with rail shooting mechanics. The game received high acclaim, being named the second-best shooting game of its year by the magazine Amiga Joker. This was just the beginning of Albinet\u8217\'20\'19s career, as he worked his way up to become game director for Assassin\u8217\'20\'19s Creed Unity in 2017, and the more recently acclaimed title, Dying Light 2.\par \par \uc2 As of lately, Albinet has been working to find new methods of creating and building games, driving him into the world of blockchain technology. He joined Darewise Entertianment as Creative Director, a game development studio focused heavily on web3 tools and infrastructures. Albinet is the company\u8217\'20\'19s creative director, where he is spearheading an MMORPG named Life Beyond\u8211\'20\'13 powered by blockchain tech. With a career spent interlocked within the gaming world, Albinet has many important insights on the industry, especially on the web3 wave of games currently being created. Let\u8217\'20\'19s delve into his thoughts and see what he makes of the future of this industry.\par \par \uc2 Marc Albinet\u8217\'20\'19s Vision of the Future\par \par \uc2 The following is an interview with Marc Albinet regarding the intersection between gaming and web3 technologies.\par \par \uc2 1- What role does Blockchain play in the gaming industry?\par \par \uc2 Currently, blockchain is used in Play-to-Earn games, which represents a small market that is essentially mobile (with some PC involvement). The console side is not proposing any blockchain elements at the moment. Not only this, but most of the big titles targeting massive audiences are not blockchain related at all. The reasons are that the Web3 market is small and cryptocurrency is not really popular inside traditional game development communities. But despite that, things are moving forward with several big publishers like \uc2 UbiSoft\uc2  and \uc2 Square Enix\uc2  seriously considering areas like player-ownership\u8211\'20\'13 offered by blockchain technology. Therefore, we can expect more important movements to occur in the near future.\par \par \uc2 2- Do you think that AAA games are the answer to Blockchain Games\u8217\'20\'19 \uc2 sustainability\uc2 ? If so, why?\par \par \uc2 Blockchain \uc2 sustainability\uc2  will come when the core value of these games will have evolved from a pure speculative reason to invest, into long-term value via the experience provided by games in the industry. The answer is less a question of scope and ambition than a question of core value and experience quality. AAA publishers are slowly considering injecting blockchain concepts into their games. But there is no need to wait for AAA to act when any studio can make great games using blockchain technology, and offer great options such as true ownership and reward mechanisms.\par \par \uc2 3- In your opinion, what\u8217\'20\'19s the best way to build a sustainable game economy using NFTs?\par \par \uc2 A game is sustainable when you want to come back in the long run. Investing in fast speculation is not sustainable. So the question is, what is it about a game that makes people come back? The quality of its experience, the quality of its immersion, and the possibility to share it with other people where you can interact and have fun with them in an often constructive manner. For NFT-based games to make an impact, they will have to propose this type of value. NFTs will need to become meaningful to be part of the experience. The reflection of it will become meaningful and gain value because this value will be shared by the community. That is our philosophy and direction: creating an experience that is not only in the game but also in our lives, so that we can build with our community so every time we release an NFT, it is part of what we share and all like: the World of Dolos (the planet which players will explore in Life Beyond) and all experiences related to it.\par \par \uc2 4- What is LifeBeyond doing differently than current NFT games?\par \par \uc2 After building the first bricks of the game and its World, we are now focusing on building the whole World and experience. Our previous alpha was created to demonstrate our ability to deliver good gameplay and our next steps are now to build the whole experience, which is the development of a whole new society on another planet. We propose people become part of the journey and build it with us; both in-game and out of the game itself.\par \par \uc2 5- Are in-game NFT\u8217\'20\'19s going to outbalance non-NFT holders? How do you Balance NFTs in-game so that the experience doesn\u8217\'20\'19t turn into a Pay-To-Win game?\par \par \uc2 NFT owners will never unbalance the game. This is for various reasons, but here are the main ones. First, we will release NFTs that have in-game utilities but these will never be attached to a challenge, so we will never release NFTs that offer better stats. We will provide NFTs alongside other in-game functionalities like a robot that is able to guard your Land or house when you\u8217\'20\'19re IRL and able to warn you IRL if someone is entering it. Players will also have the ability to upgrade their tools, equipment or weapons and sell them via NFTs.\par \par \uc2 Another important aspect is that we are building the game over the concept of expertise. Every player will have the opportunity to become an expert in at least one domain (possibly several, just a question of playtime). Some players will be experts in mining, some in building, some others in surveying underground, etc\u8230\'20\'26 We will build a whole economy so dozens of expertise options will be available. For every expertise, a tool will be needed. Working on your expertise will level up the tools. Your avatar will also level up but in only one stat. For combat, it will be your life. So leveling up your avatar by playing combat will provide you a better weapon level (with better stats) and a bigger life gauge. Your own skills in combat will also be important; like in any other game. The more you play the more you develop your skills. Weapons (expertise tools) will be possible to sell or buy via NFT, while your avatar won\u8217\'20\'19t and obviously neither will your skills. So any of your friends will be able to play with you by buying the top-notch weapon even in difficult missions, but they will still have a short life gauge and bad skills in combat. That\u8217\'20\'19s the way we will prevent the Pay-to-Win aspect. We let NFTs coming from players have a buyable value in the challenge, but it\u8217\'20\'19s only a part of the equation.\par \par \uc2 A Blockchain-Based Gaming Industry\par \par \uc2 It is clear from Marc Albinet\u8217\'20\'19s ideas that he believes the next evolution of gaming will be brought about by blockchain and web3 tech. The significance of these tools has been fully realized in the financial world, and it is now beginning to be realized in the entertainment industry. Pioneers such as Albinet are trendsetters in this space, using next-gen technologies to provide greater user experiences.\par \par \uc2 Right now, web3 games appear to lie on the fringes of the gaming sphere, but as the technology matures, and as individuals such as Albinet continue to utilize it, these types of games will become a fully ingrained part of the gaming space. They may even become the norm.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

\par\par \b \uc2 While Others Go Free, Ross Ulbricht Faces Excessive Prison Time\b0\par\par\uc2 3,412 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 This is an opinion editorial by Peter McCormack, a podcaster and filmmaker, the host of \u8220\'20\'1CWhat Bitcoin Did\u8221\'20\'1D and chairman of Real Bedford FC.\par \par \uc2 Over seven years ago, Ross Ulbricht was handed a double life sentence plus 40 years, without the possibility of parole. The \uc2 U.S. government\uc2  wants him to die in prison. The justification for such a sentence asks big questions of both the morality of the laws he was sentenced under and the judicial framework which allows for what is essentially a death sentence.\par \par \uc2 The story of Ulbricht, Silk Road, the investigation and his resultant sentencing is subjective. To some, it was an audacious and brave test of libertarianism within a system that is openly antagonistic to such actions. To others, it was the rightful incarceration of a drug dealer who caused intolerable harm. In addition, Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s story includes accusations of assassination attempts, questions regarding the constitutional aspects of the investigation, corruption within the police, the emergent need to protect online privacy and, of course, bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Most of the debate around Silk Road has rightly focused on whether the net societal impacts of providing a fully unregulated marketplace are positive or negative. It is the personal story behind the headlines that resonates with me, given that I\u8217\'20\'19m in the same peer group as Ulbricht, share similar outlooks and interests and was an occasional user of Silk Road in its early days. That is the prism through which my views have been molded. However, while I have strong opinions, I don\u8217\'20\'19t feel as though I have a morally superior view. There are plenty of people who have very troubling personal experiences, which means they will come to different conclusions about Ulbricht than I have.\par \par \uc2 Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s punishment was related directly to the nonviolent activities associated with running Silk Road, namely: distributing narcotics, distributing narcotics by means of the internet, conspiring to distribute narcotics, engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise, conspiring to commit computer hacking, conspiring to traffic in false identity documents and conspiring to commit money laundering. It is the consideration of these acts on which my opinions of Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s case rest.\par \par \uc2 Ulbricht is a young, well-educated, articulate man who has outstanding entrepreneurial skills and who harnessed the capacity of various technical innovations to bring something new to the world. The consideration by Trump in 2020 to pardon Ulbricht drew particular criticism. Nick Bilton, who {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.com/American-Kingpin-Criminal-Mastermind-Behind/dp/1591848148"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 wrote a book}}}\uc2  about Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s case, stated in a 2020 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/12/the-double-standard-of-a-trump-pardon-for-silk-road-founder-ross-ulbricht"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Vanity Fair article}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CI find it reprehensible that people on social media are so adamant that Ulbricht should be freed because he performed his crimes from behind a computer.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Bilton\u8217\'20\'19s argument was that there are currently half a million U.S. citizens incarcerated for drug offenses, with numerous examples of extensive life-changing sentences for much lesser crimes than those of Ulbricht. This calls into question how unfairly the current war on drugs targets certain social groups, which is an argument I would confidently assume the majority of Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s backers would agree with. Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s case is emblematic of the systemic failure of the war on drugs; it is not an outlier whose publicity and narrative are questionable because of relative privilege.\par \par \uc2 More importantly, Ulbricht has not looked to be treated differently by the justice system. Yes, his legal team put up a range of defenses to support his case, as is his right. Yet, once the judgment was made, Ulbricht accepted his mistakes as well as his need to be held accountable. At his original trial in 2015, prior to sentencing, Ulbricht heard the testimony from some of the parents of six victims identified to have died after consuming drugs bought via Silk Road. After hearing this, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-ross-ulbricht-sentenced"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ulbricht stated}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CI never wanted that to happen. I wish I could go back and convince myself to take a different path.\u8221\'20\'1D Then, prior to sentencing, Ulbricht {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/29/silk-road-sentencing-ross-ulbricht-asks-judge-leniency"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 begged the judge}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CI know you must take away my middle years, but please leave me my old age. Please leave a small light at the end of the tunnel, an excuse to stay healthy, an excuse to dream of better days ahead, and a chance to redeem myself before I meet my maker.\u8221\'20\'1D He was 31 at the time.\par \par \uc2 While Ulbricht admitted his guilt and culpability, it is still worth considering whether sending people to jail indefinitely for providing access to drugs is a reasonable action in a civilized society. Again, there are multiple angles to this issue and both sides of the argument have merit. Drug abuse is a massive societal issue with many tragic victims. It is hard to maintain a pro-drug stance if you have witnessed the impact on places like Los Angeles\u8217\'20\'19 Skid Row, San Francisco\u8217\'20\'19s Tenderloin area or Downtown Eastside in Vancouver.\par \par \uc2 But there is another side to this debate that does merit discussion. Essentially, should human beings be banned from ingesting substances because of the societal harm that can be inflicted? We allow access to alcohol which, when abused, is arguably one of the most destructive drugs in the world. We also embrace drugs for an increasing range of medical conditions: Over {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance#:~:text=There%20are%20over%2020%2C000%20prescription,621%20FDA%2Dlicensed%20biologics%20products."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 20,000 drugs are approved for prescription}}}\uc2  in the U.S. and are used by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://hpi.georgetown.edu/rxdrugs/#:~:text=More%20than%20131%20million%20people,and%20those%20with%20chronic%20conditions."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 66% of citizens}}}\uc2 , most of whom are seeking to reduce blood pressure, relieve pain or mitigate mental health issues. These drugs too can be abused and lead to widespread societal harm, something I\u8217\'20\'19ll touch on later. To some, the banning of certain classes of drugs for recreational or medicinal purposes is an arbitrary decision based on prejudice, ignorance and attitudes rooted in political and religious dogma.\par \par \uc2 Silk Road was first and foremost a platform for those wishing to take drugs recreationally. As I have documented in previous interviews, I used Silk Road directly for personal use. Silk Road enabled me to get easier access to my drug of choice. I abused that opportunity, and there are numerous stories of lives ruined by such activity. However, I also benefited from accessing the online community within Silk Road that provided open discussion forums predicated on supporting those struggling with addiction. That\u8217\'20\'19s not to say that the Silk Road was an attempt to help people get off drugs, but neither was it a community looking to ruthlessly exploit those suffering from addiction without any concern for their well-being.\par \par \uc2 I also benefited from the measures Silk Road implemented to improve quality control. It is a known problem that an underground drug trade facilitates unscrupulous behavior where dealers seek to maximize returns by adulterating the product. This results in bad experiences, illness and even death. Such practices are widespread. In 2004, an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00213-003-1712-7"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 assessment of ecstasy tablets}}}\uc2  from drug seizures in the 1990s found that up to 20% of the pills contained no MDMA, but were instead comprised of caffeine, ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol or placebo. In 2018, 150 people in Illinois {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theconversation.com/rat-poison-is-just-one-of-the-potentially-dangerous-substances-likely-to-be-mixed-into-illicit-drugs-163568"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 presented themselves to hospitals}}}\uc2  because they were bleeding uncontrollably after using synthetic cannabis-based products that contained rat poison. In 2021, three comedians famously died in LA after taking cocaine laced with fentanyl. Fentanyl is turning up in all kinds of drugs, which is contributing to U.S. annual {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.statista.com/chart/18744/the-number-of-drug-overdose-deaths-in-the-us/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 overdose deaths exceeding 100,000}}}\uc2  for the first time in 2021 \u8212\'20\'14 a five-fold increase since 2000; that\u8217\'20\'19s one person dying of an overdose in the U.S. every 5 minutes. A medical toxicologist {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theconversation.com/what-is-fentanyl-and-why-is-it-behind-the-deadly-surge-in-us-drug-overdoses-a-medical-toxicologist-explains-182629"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 writing for The Conversation}}}\uc2  stated, \u8220\'20\'1CBuying drugs on the street is a game of Russian roulette. From Xanax to cocaine, drugs or counterfeit pills purchased in nonmedical settings may contain life-threatening amounts of fentanyl.\u8221\'20\'1D Fentanyl is \u8220\'20\'1Cused as an adulterant because its high potency allows dealers to traffic smaller quantities but maintain the drug effects buyers expect.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Silk Road, through its user-review system that sought to mimic legal retail sites, gamified the supply of drugs to reward those providing better-quality products. It was by no means a guarantee of minimum quality nor, obviously, could it be described as a safety feature, but it was mitigation for an issue that is causing unknown harm. Professor C. Michael White of the \uc2 University of Connecticut\uc2  studied this activity and reported on it in 2021, coming to similar conclusions to other medical experts, \u8220\'20\'1CThe research is clear: Adding impurities to, or adulterating, illicit drugs is a longstanding and widespread practice with harmful consequences \u8230\'20\'26 the difference between what you believe you are buying and what is actually in the product can be the difference between life and death.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Then there is the fact the vendor and buyer are physically separated. While trying to avoid cliches, those seeking drugs are more likely to be vulnerable people, while those selling drugs are more likely to be associated with other crimes and have violent tendencies. Having drug transactions forced underground means that vendors are forced to interact with buyers. This opens up all manor of risks, directly related to the interaction and indirectly to the locations where such interactions take place. There are short-term risks associated with specific transactions and longer-term risks associated with exploitative relationships that can develop. Silk Road broke this link. The \uc2 Drug Policy Alliance\uc2 , a New York-based nonprofit organization, stated that Silk Road was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://drugpolicy.org/blog/silk-road-was-safer-streets-buyerssellers"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 safer than the streets}}}\uc2  for buyers and sellers. In a 2015 article, they asserted that Silk Road \u8220\'20\'1Cgave us a new way to imagine better management of the drug trade \u8230\'20\'26 We need something better than what we have now, which is nothing but failure, cartels and beheadings, mass incarceration, mandatory minimums, a vibrant and throbbing illicit market, and a prison industrial complex totally out of control.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 An important (albeit potentially small) cohort of those who used Silk Road did so to gain access to drugs for medicinal purposes. While Ulbricht was not explicitly motivated to meet the specific needs of those failed by conventional health care, this is an important factor to account for, and again, something for which I used Silk Road. There are clearly valid concerns regarding the risks of people self-medicating. Nevertheless, there is also a critical need to respect the needs of those suffering from illnesses seeking treatments outside of official medicinal practices. There are those facing the worst challenges in life, desperate to relieve chronic pain, extreme mental anguish or even people facing death. If these people want to seek drugs that are not available to them through official means, is it right that society denies them this choice?\par \par \uc2 While it is true that prescribed drugs are subject to strict clinical trials, there are also valid concerns that other drugs \u8212\'20\'14 which have equally powerful medicinal, therapeutic and life-affirming effects \u8212\'20\'14 have been arbitrarily prohibited. This includes psychedelics and MDMA, which are showing promise in the treatment of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and cannabis, which I know from personal experience that many people are desperate to use for a range of known and powerful benefits. The British Medical Journal reported in December last year that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/epileptic-seizure-frequency-fell-by-86-in-kids-treated-with-whole-plant-medicinal-cannabis/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 epileptic seizure frequency fell by 86%}}}\uc2  in kids treated with whole plant medicinal cannabis. Although cannabis products in the U.K. were made legal for patients with \u8220\'20\'1Cexceptional clinical need\u8221\'20\'1D in July 2018, according to a 2021 report in The Economist, parents are struggling to access prescriptions: \u8220\'20\'1CJust three children \u8230\'20\'26 have been given prescriptions by the \uc2 National Health Service\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D It is perverse cruelty that prevents people from obtaining widely available, but illegal drugs that have been proven to uniquely diminish suffering.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CReasonable people may and do disagree about the social utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances, or even of criminal prohibition of their sale and use at all. It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use.\u8221\'20\'1D These were not the words of any libertarian activist seeking to shine a light on Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s case; these were the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.wired.com/2017/05/silk-road-creator-ross-ulbricht-loses-life-sentence-appeal/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 words of the appellate court\u8217\'20\'19s opinion}}}\uc2  in their determination of Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s appeal in 2017. The court affirmed the original sentence given to Ulbricht in 2015, but as the opinion attests, it is clear that they were uncomfortable with having to apply U.S. drug laws. If the legal profession enforcing the laws openly questions those very laws, surely we have approached a time for some reasoned debate.\par \par \uc2 Beyond the arguments about access to drugs within society, Ulbricht\u8217\'20\'19s case brings into question the validity of penalties imposed on behalf of the state. The sentence handed down to Ulbricht \u8212\'20\'14 imprisoning him for the rest of his life \u8212\'20\'14 is a punishment reserved for the most heinous criminals. Such punishment is illegal in a number of countries, including Mexico, Brazil, Uruguay, Portugal, Croatia and the Vatican City: The Pope {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://archive.ph/20141024002736/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1404377.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 described a life sentence}}}\uc2  as a hidden type of death sentence. The Penal Reform International {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cdn.penalreform.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/PRI_Life-Imprisonment-Briefing.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stated in a 2018 report}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CLife imprisonment without parole, in particular, raises issues of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, and undermines the right to human dignity by taking away the prospect of rehabilitation.\u8221\'20\'1D Even among those countries that apply full life sentences, there are large disparities in the extent to which it is applied: In France in 2014, 0.7 per 100,000 inhabitants were serving life sentences while in the U.S., it was over 50 people per 100,000 inhabitants.\par \par \uc2 Then there is the issue of comparable harm. It is a tricky area to compare different crimes in terms of harm, but in determining the sentencing of Ulbricht, as stated, the court heard testimony from the families of six people who died after consuming drugs bought from Silk Road. Therefore, this is a reasonable measure by which to compare the societal harm caused by other crimes. Between 1999 and 2020, 538,000 Americans died during the period referred to as the opioid crisis. Forbes estimated the economic toll of the opioid epidemic being over {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2022/02/04/economic-toll-of-opioid-epidemic-13-trillion-a-year/?sh=1c468f582792"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $1.3 trillion per year}}}\uc2 . The crisis was triggered by the aggressive promotion of a prescription painkiller called OxyContin launched by \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  in 1996. By 2004, OxyContin had become the leading drug of abuse in the U.S.\par \par \uc2 Purdue Pharma was owned by the Sackler family, who had a dominant presence on the company\u8217\'20\'19s board. Despite contesting their liability for years, in 2020, \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  finally {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/22/purdue-pharma-opioids-epidemic-guilty-plea-analysis"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 admitted}}}\uc2  to bribing doctors to needlessly prescribe OxyContin, lying to the \uc2 Drug Enforcement Administration\uc2  (DEA) and paying illegal kickbacks for the purposes of promoting opioid prescribing to physicians. \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  aggressively marketed OxyContin, while critically underplaying its addictive nature, its failure to achieve marketed pain-relief claims and pushing clinicians to administer dangerously high doses. The painkiller has 10 or 20 times the narcotic content of many regular painkillers and is 50% stronger than morphine. A \uc2 Los Angeles Times{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 investigation stated}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1COxyContin is a chemical cousin of heroin, and when it doesn\u8217\'20\'19t last, patients can experience excruciating symptoms of withdrawal, including an intense craving for the drug.\u8221\'20\'1D Time and again, it turned normal Americans into addicts, who then turned to other drugs (such as heroin and synthetic fentanyl) when their pain relief was intolerable, their prescriptions stopped and/or their addictions spiraled out of control. \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  knew this, and yet they continued to market the drug \u8212\'20\'14 hard.\par \par \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  was assisted by \uc2 McKinsey\uc2 , the management consulting firm. According to a lawsuit brought by the Massachusetts Attorney General, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/business/purdue-pharma-mckinsey-oxycontin-opiods.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 McKinsey showed Purdue Pharma}}}\uc2  how to \u8220\'20\'1Cturbocharge\u8221\'20\'1D sales of OxyContin, how to counter efforts by drug enforcement agents to reduce opioid use and was part of a team that looked at how \u8220\'20\'1Cto counter the emotional messages from mothers with teenagers that overdosed on the drug.\u8221\'20\'1D There have been numerous court cases over OxyContin, resulting in fines, bankruptcy and the closure of the firm. There are legal battles over whether the Sackler family should be held personally liable in civil and criminal courts. Yet, nobody from \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  has received a prison sentence over their involvement.\par \par \uc2 In 2020, activists and journalists uncovered a 2007 Department of Justice memo that had recommended felony charges against senior \uc2 Purdue Pharma\uc2  executives on the basis that they started the conspiracy in 1992, knew about OxyContin\u8217\'20\'19s abuse problems within months of its 1996 launch, lied to Congress and were continuing in the conspiracy. The charges could have resulted in prison sentences. However, the DoJ decided not to file such charges at the time, because, as author Gerald Posner {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.posner.com/geraldposner/2020/08/just-unsealed-2006-doj-memo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stated in his book \u8220\'20\'1CPharma,\u8221\'20\'1D}}}\uc2  DoJ officials were concerned that \u8220\'20\'1CPurdue\u8217\'20\'19s large, well-funded legal team might well overwhelm [the Department of Justice\u8217\'20\'19s] small group of prosecutors.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 And there\u8217\'20\'19s the rub. Justice that seeks to account for comparable harm is compromised by the wealth and power of those being brought to justice. This is maybe why only one person in the U.S. was jailed \u8212\'20\'14 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ig.ft.com/jailed-bankers/#:~:text=Forty%2Dseven%20bankers%20were%20sentenced,the%20financial%20sector's%20catastrophic%20failures"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 for 2 years 6 months}}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 as a result of the Global Financial Crisis, despite the fact that it has left lasting scars across the U.S. and the world. A 2018 study by the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  found the crisis cost every single American approximately $70,000 \u8212\'20\'14 and the social impacts have been more damaging. A \uc2 U.K. government\uc2  body {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57a08a80e5274a31e000062e/60895-part1_crisis_lit_review-effects_of_GFC.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 stated in a 2018 report}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CThe implications of the crisis on poverty, employment and political stability are worrying.\u8221\'20\'1D This is maybe why nobody has been held to account for taking the U.S. and U.K. to war with Iraq in 2003 on the basis of a lie, despite it resulting in approximately 200,000 civilian deaths, tens of thousands of military deaths, the displacement of millions, stability issues across the Middle East, and as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/10/15/heres-why-the-iraq-war-may-have-helped-trigger-the-financial-crisis/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 some have argued}}}\uc2 , maybe the Global Financial Crisis itself. This is maybe why Exxon hasn\u8217\'20\'19t been called to account for hiding the fact they knew the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 science behind climate change was real}}}\uc2  over 40 years ago, but instead of raising the alarm, they spent millions promoting misinformation, while the issue increasingly seems like it\u8217\'20\'19s getting out of control.\par \par \uc2 Justice delayed is justice denied. But with the above cases, it\u8217\'20\'19s not clear that justice will ever be served. At the same time, in a prison in Tucson, Arizona, Ross Ulbricht is being held without even the faint glimmer of hope that he will even be allowed to contest his incarceration, let alone secure any type of freedom. This isn\u8217\'20\'19t whataboutism, this isn\u8217\'20\'19t an attempt to confuse the issue, to muddy the waters such that Ulbricht is made out to be a heroic victim. This is merely to show that a flawed young man, who sought to test the limits of government controls on personal freedoms, is being held to the highest account, while those who seek to use their power and influence to inflict uncalled-for harm on significant proportions of society are allowed to walk freely among us.\par \par \uc2 Civilizations throughout time and across geographies and cultures have established approaches to drugs that are vastly different to the ones governments impose now. The current paradigm is neither faultless nor permanent. Laws and rules are always being tested by innovation and pugnacious individuals looking to account for changing attitudes outside of the guardrails of laws. There are risks and benefits to these approaches, just as there are risks and benefits to maintaining the status quo. Nevertheless, irrespective of the merits of reappraising the legal approach to drug use, laws were broken and a judgment was made. The rule of law demands that all people are held accountable. As Theodore Roosevelt said, \u8220\'20\'1CNo man is above the law.\u8221\'20\'1D It was therefore a reasonable expectation that a just punishment would be required, just as it is reasonable to demand that justice be applied equally throughout society irrespective of power and influence. It is also a widely held principle that the enforcement of laws should be fair. In this regard, it is reasonable to declare that a life sentence contravenes {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights}}}\uc2 , \u8220\'20\'1CNo one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Ross Ulbricht should not die in prison, especially when many powerful criminals live free.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Peter McCormack.

\par\par \b \uc2 Tesla\uc2  teaches Web3 how to make products people actually want\b0\par\par\uc2 Adrian Barkley \par \uc2 776 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Tesla\uc2  has arguably done more for environmentalism than most green projects put together. By making the best cars not be gas guzzlers, they dramatically changed the \uc2 environmental\uc2  outlook for the entire auto industry, and aligned consumers' interest in amazing products with society\u8217\'20\'19s long-term interests. Web3 would do well to take note.\par \par \uc2 Car buyers have always been interested in having the sleekest design, shiniest leather seats, flashiest rims, and fastest vehicle. By building a car that actually competes on those specs rather than another version of the Prius, \uc2 Tesla\uc2  has leaned into an already existing incentive structure in the car industry, and thereby made the company a tremendous force for good. Some companies in blockchain entertainment have taken a leaf out of the Musk playbook, and are leaning into already existing consumer desires to create attractive products.\par \par \uc2 Ever since the likes of Axie Infinity and Spielworks\u8217\'20\'19s Womplay platform helped pioneer play-to-earn gaming a few short years ago, the industry has been clamoring to expand on the idea that cryptocurrencies can fuel a new kind of gaming that empowers users to actually earn and spend digital currency. The play-to-earn industry even went through a fad of many companies changing the term to play-and-earn, to emphasize tokenomics shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t come at the expense of gameplay.\par \par \uc2 A great example is Anomura, which has introduced a play-to-donate model. Players have the choice to allocate in-game rewards towards wildlife conservation. This ups the ante from projects working to be carbon neutral, to actually empowering players themselves to do \uc2 environmental\uc2  good. This kind of project can transform the P2E industries through in-game social impact initiatives, but only if the game truly catches the masses.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, the blockchain ecosystem is well-positioned to follow the \uc2 Tesla\uc2  approach of leaning into consumers because the entire point of most blockchain initiatives is to do so. And this goes beyond finance via DeFi, or art via NFTs. Even in sports, there is a way to expand into new markets, as LEAP zeros in on talented young athletes. With its TikTok-like interface, the platform leverages crypto tokenomics to empower young, undiscovered athletes to showcase their skills and gain support from talent seekers. The kids are already spending their time on Social Media, but in this case they support their growth and career instead of just gameplay for the sake of fun\u8212\'20\'14leaning into the target market for the target market\u8217\'20\'19s advantage.\par \par \uc2 Just like \uc2 Tesla\uc2  transformed auto, so did \uc2 Spotify\uc2  and \uc2 Apple\uc2  music change the music industry not long ago. Consumers used to purchase an album for a pretty penny, but now they enjoy huge catalogs from a small monthly subscription. Still music fans are just passively consuming, and the rewards of the industry are reserved for a small group of elite talent.\par \par \uc2 Now, music companies move past just minting NFT\u8217\'20\'19s off of album art. Instead, they use blockchain to create an opportunity to lean into music consumers desire to be active participants in the industry.\par \par \uc2 One example is Gala Music, a blockchain-based music streaming platform that provides fans with unique opportunities to enrich their experiences. Rather than a centralized structure where a platform itself would hold all the music and control access to it, every listen on Gala Music comes from an NFT track hosted on a Player Node or Fan Node within the platform. Listeners can become the providers of essential infrastructure for worldwide music broadcast, and reap handsome rewards from it.\par \par \uc2 Don\u8217\'20\'19t shove the blockchain down someone's throat\par \par \uc2 Making a killer product but incorporating a blockchain framework in a seamless way is easier said than done, but it truly is imperative. If blockchain companies try to sell by just focusing on blockchain\u8217\'20\'19s added value, like transparency, decentralization etc. they are missing the forest for the trees. The focus must be on making products the best they can be, but they just happen to incorporate blockchain.\par \par \uc2 It is understandable from a branding perspective that companies try to lean into the blockchain identity, and that\u8217\'20\'19s fair. But if the industry is going to actually take wings, companies need to restrain themselves. A user should be able to use a game or a platform, with a simple and attractive interface, and scarcely notice that they\u8217\'20\'19re in the Web3 space. This way Web3 will reach mass adoption by its own volition.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

After completing yet another significant upgrade, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/coins/cardano/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Cardano}}}\uc2  is operating flawlessly once again. The Cardano team has always tried to enhance the network and its users' overall experience.\par \par \uc2 However, the episode was quite the opposite of what the community expected, as people thought ADA's price would surge after the hard fork, but eventually, it was under selling pressure.\par \par \uc2 During the weekend, Cardano was in bearish mode, having difficulty recording encouraging gains after the much-anticipated Vasil hard fork that was pushed earlier in September.\par \par \uc2 Curiously, Cardano developers have just released yet another update, koios-go-client v2.0.0. Positive \uc2 environmental\uc2  changes aside, ADA's indicators pointed to gloomy times ahead.\par \par \uc2 Charles Hoskinson\uc2 , ADA is Entering New Era\par \par \uc2 Charles Hoskinson\uc2 , maintaining his custom, used \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to inform his fans of forthcoming developments. The creator of Cardano has recently declared a new epoch for the network. His proposed "Age of Voltaire" could help spread network decentralization.\par \par \uc2 Hoskinson's tweet says this new era is geared toward the people who create and use networks. He argues that Cardano aspires to develop decentralized governance in a manner that 'shows' the remainder of the space how to do it right.\par \par \uc2 Facing Down Rivals\par \par \uc2 Cardano has taken a lot of flak in the crypto community since many traders and investors think the network is not expanding quickly enough. In the most recent instance, Ethereum guru Evan Van Ness referred to the blockchain as a "zombie chain."\par \par \uc2 Van Ness noted, despite Uniswap's far smaller market price, it experienced more transactions than Cardano. These aren't the ideal projects to use as an example because of the vast differences in how they operate and generate revenue.\par \par \uc2 But in terms of decentralized financial activity, Cardano is behind other networks. Hence, this criticism adds downward pressure on Cardano's price.\par \par \uc2 Cardano Price Review & Tokenomics\par \par \uc2 At the time of writing, Cardano's current price is $0.4267, with a 24-hour trading volume of $478,371,258. Cardano has fallen by 0.25% in the last 24 hours and 3.84% in seven days.\par \par \uc2 CoinMarketCap currently ranks #8 with a live market cap of $14,618,490,093. It has a total supply of 45,000,000,000 ADA coins and a circulating supply of 34,253,127,048 ADA coins.\par \par \uc2 Cardano Price Prediction\par \par \uc2 The ADA/USD has formed a descending triangle pattern, extending support near the $0.4181 level. Because descending triangles are likely to break on the lower side, it's critical to keep an eye on the $0.4181 level.\par \par \uc2 A break below this level can cause downward pressure, leading the ADA price to an immediate support level of $0.3675. Alternatively, if the ADA/USD coin remains above $0.4180, the triple bottom support level may continue to rise towards $0.4850.\par \par \uc2 On the daily timeframe, a downward trendline at $0.4850 may obstruct Cardano's upward movement. However, increased demand for Cardano could cut through this level and extend the uptrend until $0.5275 or $0.5835.\par \par \uc2 Leading technical indicators like the RSI and MACD remain below 50 and 0, respectively, indicating a bearish trend in Cardano. The 50-day moving average, on the other hand, is likely to keep the ADA price below $0.4600.\par \par \uc2 As a result, reaching $1 will be a significant challenge for Cardano.\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020221003eia3000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw120\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1800\pichgoal600

PussyDAO will start off by offering NFTs that can be redeemed at any time for the physical underwear, but she has larger ambitions for the brand over time.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/90630/decrypt-top-13-rising-stars/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 13 Rising Stars in Crypto}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re using Web3 tech to scale the next generation of apparel, CPG [consumer packaged goods] products, software drops, and experiences,\u8221\'20\'1D Howell told Decrypt in a followup chat via Telegram. \u8220\'20\'1COur brand is punk rock meets hyperfemininity: we\u8217\'20\'19re gritty, girly, and powerful\u8212\'20\'14and a much-needed breath of fresh air in this bro-centric space.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Howell\u8217\'20\'19s plan is to expand the PussyDAO brand into \u8220\'20\'1Canything that\u8217\'20\'19s super hype-y,\u8221\'20\'1D including the aforementioned products and experiences.\par \par \uc2 The idea of redeeming a blockchain token for physical apparel isn\u8217\'20\'19t new, and it\u8217\'20\'19s been explored in various ways.

\par\par \b \uc2 Crypto is Thriving Through Offshore Corporate Structures\b0\par\par\uc2 1,106 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Marc Piano, Senior Associate at global offshore law firm Harneys, is a member of the Investment Funds, Corporate, and Banking & Finance teams in the Cayman Islands office. Phil Graham, Partner at Harneys, is global head of the Investment Funds and Regulatory groups and head of the transactional team in the British Virgin Islands.\par \par \uc2 __________\par \par \uc2 The buzz around a virtual asset or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/web3/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 web3}}}\uc2  project will typically focus on the \u8216\'20\'18front-end\u8217\'20\'19 \u8211\'20\'13 the product offering, team, partnerships, and performance; how it is going to change the world. Whilst accepting that the corporate structuring behind the front-end is far less exciting, it truly can make the difference between a project\u8217\'20\'19s success and \uc2 sustainability\uc2  or its failure and damaging fallout.\par \par \uc2 Many web3 projects aspire to decentralisation, but initially consist of a small and highly centralised team. Like any early-stage start-up, a crypto project will usually want to set up a corporate structure to protect the project\u8217\'20\'19s team and its assets, secure funding, and start doing business with real-world counterparties.\par \par \uc2 Similar considerations will also apply to principals wanting to set up a cryptoasset-focused fund, who will want to seek and provide for attractive returns, have an optimised {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/tax/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tax}}}\uc2  structure and, be appealing to an investor base all over the world, whilst protecting the investment management vehicle and the fund\u8217\'20\'19s other service providers by using a flexible and appropriately regulated structure for their launch.\par \par \uc2 With that in mind, international financial centres (IFCs), such as the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Cayman Islands provide attractive solutions for both crypto projects and crypto funds.\par \par \uc2 For decades IFCs have offered tax-neutral and appropriately regulated financial services products to their users through sophisticated and experienced financial services providers. For example, many investment funds and other financial services products are domiciled in IFCs, including the vast majority of the world\u8217\'20\'19s crypto funds: an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/pdf/4th-annual-global-crypto-hedge-fund-report-june-2022.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 estimated}}}\uc2  63% of which utilise Cayman Islands and BVI vehicles.\par \par \uc2 One shining example of innovation by IFCs to create vehicles for specific uses is the Cayman Islands foundation company. Foundation companies are not required to have charitable or non-profit purposes and unlike most corporate vehicles, are not required to have members in order to remain in existence. These two factors make foundation companies attractive to projects aiming for decentralisation as they can serve as a memberless vehicle with the sole purpose of supporting the project or its governance protocol. The foundation company can engage with third parties or hold certain assets in support of the project and can be bound by its constitutional documents to act on the instructions of a governance protocol or its representatives.\par \par \uc2 In addition, virtual asset regulations in the BVI and the Cayman Islands allow BVI or Cayman Islands entities to be used as the token issuer, with private sales being largely unregulated and public sales of tokens being subject to appropriate levels of regulatory oversight.\par \par \uc2 A structure that is frequently used involves establishing a Cayman Islands foundation company, which owns a token issuing vehicle, typically formed in the BVI. The director(s) of these companies will often be a professional services provider, who can take guidance from the governance protocol adopted by the decentralised autonomous organisation ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/tags/dao/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 DAO}}}\uc2  ). This approach separates each entity\u8217\'20\'19s functions appropriately as well as reducing some risk and simplifying accounting for the project and team. For many projects, this can enhance decentralisation governance and further remove the founders and team from the corporate structure that will carry out activities.\par \par \uc2 All of this being said, there is no one size fits all approach to crypto fund or crypto project structuring. Each team must carefully consider their commercial requirements, risk appetite, and legal, regulatory, and tax position.\par \par \uc2 Slavishly copying a structure used by other projects is a dangerous game particularly without understanding that project\u8217\'20\'19s objectives, legal and tax advice, and risk appetite in a shifting regulatory landscape.\par \par \uc2 Engaging crypto-experienced service providers early in the process means a fund or project can get the right advice early enough to avoid costly mistakes to understand fully their legal and regulatory position, the tax implications of a proposed structure (both for founders, users, and the project vehicles themselves), reduce risk where possible, and avoid consequences which may arise well after a fund or project is launched that could be difficult or impossible to remedy.\par \par \uc2 In addition to choosing the right structure, the global regulatory landscape crypto is in flux. The Financial Action Task Force ( {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/global-anti-money-laundering-watchdog-presses-countries-crypto-exchanges-to-implement-key-requirement-faster.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 FATF}}}\uc2  )\u8211\'20\'13 the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog \u8211\'20\'13 published anti-money laundering standards and recommendations for certain crypto businesses which jurisdictions must implement locally to avoid being subject to sanctions such as blacklisting. Not all crypto businesses will be affected in the same way by new crypto regulations and, of course, other laws and regulations, such as securities, investments, banking, substance, and data protection legislation may apply to a project, so a local legal and regulatory analysis may be required for each vehicle in a structure.\par \par \uc2 In this context, it is incredibly important for readers to realise that using a vehicle domiciled in an \uc2 IFC\uc2  won\u8217\'20\'19t absolve crypto projects of their obligations to comply with the relevant laws and regulations in countries in which they do business or in which their clients or customers are based, especially given the fact that a large number of the digital asset projects often involve a mixture of \uc2 IFC\uc2  vehicles and vehicles domiciled onshore.\par \par \uc2 Crypto continues to grow and thrive regardless of market setbacks and downturns. Many of the world\u8217\'20\'19s largest crypto funds and businesses use \uc2 IFC\uc2  vehicles to optimise their corporate structure, and startup projects with the right advice can also benefit from the jurisdictional and structuring advantages offered by IFCs and their corporate vehicles.\par \par \uc2 IFC\uc2  jurisdictions recognise the value of crypto in strengthening their global offering, so local governments and regulators regularly consult with industry to understand trends and implement frameworks to position themselves to capture crypto market share while complying with international standards around corporate and tax transparency and reporting.\par \par \uc2 This agility is difficult to find in onshore jurisdictions and helps IFCs maintain their reputation as preferred jurisdictions for businesses with a global client base, to the point where some projects have opted to have physical offices and staff on the ground itself. The physical benefits of residing in these jurisdictions are for an entirely separate publication, but there is no doubt that there is a perfectly aligned approach on both islands, which means that both the BVI and Cayman Islands should always be firmly in the mind of anyone operating in this space.\par \par \uc2 ____\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020221001eia10002t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Five Reasons Why American Cities Will Be The Engine Of The U.S. Bitcoin Economy\b0\par\par\uc2 3,045 \uc2 words\par \uc2 1 October 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 This is an opinion editorial by Frank Nuessle, previously a T.V. executive, university professor and publishing entrepreneur.\par \par \uc2 "A good community insures itself by trust, by good faith and good will, by mutual help. A good community, in other words, is a good local economy." \u8212\'20\'14 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://berrycenter.org/about/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Wendell Berry}}}\uc2 , Work of Local Culture\par \par \uc2 As the Canadian entrepreneur {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.jeffreybooth.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jeff Booth}}}\uc2  has opined - Bitcoin is the \u8220\'20\'1Cbridge to the other side.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 In this article I argue that to cross that bridge, the American Bitcoin Economy would best be structured as a network of interconnected city-centered economies, all using Bitcoin and all competing with each other.\par \par \uc2 The complexity of designing such a decentralized, highly networked money system to operate alongside the current highly centralized fiat money system is mind-boggling, almost overwhelming. Thinking about it makes my head hurt. It is like trying to change all four tires on a Land Rover racing along at 80 miles an hour. Yet that is the task at hand.\par \par \uc2 As a guy from the hinterlands, I have been ruminating on fiat money since Nixon took America off the gold standard in 1971, and I\u8217\'20\'19ve been studying money systems seriously for 20 years \u8212\'20\'14 not long ago as a professor in the organizational dynamics department at the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2 , where I taught graduate courses in \uc2 sustainability\uc2 . Today I consider myself a social system architect and a Bitcoin maximalist. But I digress.\par \par \uc2 Cities have been at the center of America's economic progress starting not long after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudson"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Henry Hudson}}}\uc2  discovered Manhattan in 1609.\par \par \uc2 By 1641 Manhattan had become America\u8217\'20\'19s economic hub around which the circle of Atlantic trade turned.\par \par \uc2 At first Manhattan was controlled by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.russellshorto.com/book/the-island-at-the-center-of-the-world/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the Dutch who were tolerant of all people}}}\uc2 , which is why Manhattan developed an intensively active merchant class \u8212\'20\'14 everyone wanting to buy, sell, grow and spend, while also becoming one of the most multicultural places on earth.\par \par \uc2 Because it was founded on the principles of free-market capitalism, Manhattan offered an unprecedented opportunity for advancement. Upward mobility became an inherent part of American culture, while at the same time, planting the dream of economic freedom throughout the world.\par \par \uc2 Today that American dream of a free and fair chance for all has been severely tarnished.\par \par \uc2 American cities are no longer the center of a vibrant, free-market economy but instead are plagued with escalating violence, congested gridlock, unmanageable homelessness, essential worker displacement, housing shortages, rent escalation and deteriorating infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 The root problem is that America\u8217\'20\'19s current corporate-capitalist economy is being run as a corporate oligarchy, supported by a fiat money cartel that funnels money to the already rich, instead of as a critically-thinking free-enterprise democracy.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 George Santayana}}}\uc2  once observed that America doesn\u8217\'20\'19t solve its problems; it leaves them behind.\par \par \uc2 America needs to leave behind the futile attempts to resurrect an industrial/consumer economy of perpetual growth fueled by fiat money.\par \par \uc2 Our current economic narrative pits jobs and the ability of the middle class to earn a living against the environment. This mind-set of perpetuating infinite economic growth to feed an already rich elite, a shrinking middle class and a desperate citizen under-class will only produce mutually assured destruction.\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/businessweek/videos/2011-10-18/nassim-taleb-on-wall-street-protest-banking/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Nassim Taleb}}}\uc2 , author of \u8220\'20\'1CThe Black Swan,\u8221\'20\'1D stated in Bloomberg Businessweek:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re not living in capitalism. We\u8217\'20\'19re not living in socialism. We\u8217\'20\'19re living in some weird economic situation with the banks controlling more of their share. It\u8217\'20\'19s like we\u8217\'20\'19re serving them rather than them serving us.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 America needs to evolve a new form of sound money capitalism that values social equity along with human and planetary well-being because oligarchic capitalism does not recognize these as critical components of long-term societal and economic health.\par \par \uc2 In short, what America needs is a coherent new economic narrative that paints a picture of a viable and prosperous future, an economic model I call "distributed capitalism,\u8221\'20\'1D a term coined by {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.foet.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jeremy Rifkin}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Rifkin sees distributed capitalism as the centerpiece of a third Industrial Revolution in which a new social vision unfolds with power broadly distributed, \u8220\'20\'1Cencouraging unprecedented new levels of collaboration among peoples\u8221\'20\'1D.\par \par \uc2 A distributed free-enterprise economy consists of many interconnected free-enterprise networks and is the most complex and creatively dynamic system on the planet.\par \par \uc2 No other economic operating system comes close to providing the shared societal benefits of a truly competitive marketplace.\par \par \uc2 Here are five reasons why centering the evolution of the American Bitcoin Economy around a network of interconnected city-centered economies (all using BTC, and all competing with each other) will allow for the fulfillment of Rifkin\u8217\'20\'19s vision of a third Industrial Revolution. Think of it as the flowering of Web 3.0.\par \par \uc2 Cities Have Historically Driven Economic Prosperity\par \par \uc2 It was the cities of Italy, Florence, Milan and particularly Venice that initiated the economic renaissance of Europe in the 13th century after the profound decline in trade which began in the eighth century with the abandonment of gold coinage.\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://allenfarrington.medium.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Allen Farrington}}}\uc2  has written about in his book \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Venice-Essays-Future-Capitalism/dp/B09TTTGT11"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Venice is Bitcoin}}}\uc2  \u8221\'20\'1D that city, like Manhattan in the 17th century, developed a system of justice providing impartial protection for both the rich and the poor where the mercantile class were treated fairly. \u8220\'20\'1CEven the word \u8216\'20\'18bank,\u8217\'20\'19 in the financial sense, originates in Venice, from the banca or \u8216\'20\'18benches\u8217\'20\'19 of moneychangers by the Rialto Bridge.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This was the beginning of a new social and political order, labeled as the Renaissance, that emerged out of centuries of feudalism, all created out of trade and capital formation based on sound money.\par \par \uc2 As the centuries rolled by, the dominant city trade centers changed from empire to empire \u8212\'20\'14 Barcelona for the Spanish, Amsterdam for the Dutch, London for the English and then Manhattan for America.\par \par \uc2 With Sound Money, Cities Will Drive \uc2 Sustainability\par \par \uc2 In her 1969 book, \u8220\'20\'1CThe Economy of Cities\u8221\'20\'1D {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://centerforthelivingcity.org/janejacobs/#jane-and-the-center"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Jane Jacobs}}}\uc2  argued that the primary driver of economic development was cities. Her main point was that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement or the process of producing goods locally that formally were imported. Jacobs believed that population density was necessary for entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor.\par \par \uc2 With the increasing level of global warming disruptions coupled with the critical need to reduce consumption of fossil fuels, it should be obvious that producing goods locally and accelerating import replacement will be important objectives of the bitcoin economy.\par \par \uc2 Why would a sound money, distributed free-enterprise economy drive import replacement?\par \par \uc2 The term "distributed free-enterprise" is really just a vast network of cities, rural outposts and communities of all sizes where business and government work together for the betterment of all citizens, fueled by the creative energies of citizens who exchange value and culture in an open, transparent way.\par \par \uc2 This economic model fosters more individual creativity and innovation, and more ways of doing things than in an economy with the uniformity and rigidity of a command-and-control corporate structure.\par \par \uc2 If cities were able to control their own money systems, one outcome would be a notable shift in the configuration of power. Local residents would be less subject to the will of far-off centers of power. Local businesses would be able through import substitution to produce goods and services locally and then sell them wherever they wanted.\par \par \uc2 The end result would be a wider diversity of locally produced products and services with greater resilience and adaptability to change in our unpredictable future of potential economic and severe \uc2 climate change\uc2  disruptions.\par \par \uc2 Place-Based Sound Money Aligns With Human Nature\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_White_(author)"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Curtis White}}}\uc2  in his book, \u8220\'20\'1CLiving in a World that Cannot be Fixed,\u8221\'20\'1D writes, \u8220\'20\'1CHuman cultures are about place: where to live, and home: how to live and with whom.\u8221\'20\'1D With social media, place has increasingly become an abstraction with confusing effects on human nature. A new grounding can occur in cities with place-based sound money.\par \par \uc2 One of the most unsung heroes in the study of honest money and human nature was the author {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://beyondmoney.net/2009/09/07/the-legacy-of-e-c-riegel/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 E.C. Riegel}}}\uc2 , an independent scholar who dedicated himself in the 1930s to understanding the exchange of value. His belief was that a simple, honest system for the exchange of value would do more to enhance the dignity and wellbeing of the common man than any political reform.\par \par \uc2 Riegel was a genius at understanding human nature and the functioning of money as a social system. He identified two important principles of human nature \u8212\'20\'14 self-preservation and self-advancement, along with a derivative third principle \u8212\'20\'14 the three-part free enterprise system.\par \par \uc2 Self-preservation is the first principle of human nature. Riegel believed that selfishness is \u8220\'20\'1Cthe sublime law of being.\u8221\'20\'1D But to be intelligently selfish, a person must win the respect and cooperation of his/her fellows which leads to the second principle \u8212\'20\'14 self advancement through cooperation.\par \par \uc2 Before a person can win cooperation, he/she must be able and willing to give it. Until a person has obtained a selfish level of cooperation with his/her fellows, no social order exists. Cooperation finds its expression in the free exchange of value. Fostering the free exchange of value is the engine for social and economic progress.\par \par \uc2 Riegel\u8217\'20\'19s third principle was the three-part free enterprise system of specialization of labor, exchange of value, and competition. He saw honest competition as the sublime law of nature and the basis for a truly high functioning economic operating system fostered by sound money.\par \par \uc2 This system cannot be improved upon. Every human is the servant of every other human. This is the law of life. Either you serve life or its opposite.\par \par \uc2 Out of these principles, human civilization began its evolution in the early cities and continued throughout history in the world\u8217\'20\'19s city centers.\par \par \uc2 Competition Within Cities And Between Cities Creates Resilience\par \par \uc2 Honest competition is the evolutionary search engine for humans, seeking fact-based truth at all costs.\par \par \uc2 As the evolutionary economist, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ineteconomics.org/research/experts/ebeinhocker"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Eric Beinhocker}}}\uc2  has shown, evolution is an algorithm; it is an all-purpose formula for innovation. It is a simple but profound three-step process: differentiate, select, amplify. Evolution is a search algorithm that finds needles of good design in haystacks of possibility.\par \par \uc2 In a sound money environment, the most intelligently selfish individual is the most socially minded, productive and creative. When transparency rules, those who will not deal fairly are defeated by competitors.\par \par \uc2 A centralized fiat money monoculture creates monopolies which destroy competition. Competition is indispensable to the successful operation of a monetary system.\par \par \uc2 Honest competition contains corruption and incentivizes innovation.\par \par \uc2 In nature there is a constant push\u8211\'20\'13pull tension between two emergent properties: efficiency and resilience.\par \par \uc2 Efficiency requires scale \u8212\'20\'14 bigness. Today\u8217\'20\'19s monetary monoculture has skewed the balance too much to efficiency, for example, forcing small local banks serving one city region to sell out to national conglomerates.\par \par \uc2 Resilience\uc2  requires a network of relatively independent self-reliant cities, so that the failure of one does not imperil the entire system. Those cities best able to withstand future crises \u8212\'20\'14 whether pandemics, climate disruptions or financial meltdown \u8212\'20\'14 will be the ones that thrive economically by fostering internal prosperity and competing fairly with other cities.\par \par \uc2 Such resilient markets will also be the best place for investors to park their money. Such cities will attract the best and the brightest people. They will be the places where residents feel secure enough to innovate.\par \par \uc2 A City Economy Is A Local Living System\par \par \uc2 As the late Belgian physical chemist and Nobel laureate {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1977/prigogine/facts/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ila Prigogine}}}\uc2  observed, all living systems are dissipative structures ruled by the second law of thermodynamics. Living systems maintain their structure by the continuous flow of energy throughout the system.\par \par \uc2 This flow of energy keeps the system in a constant state of flux. Fluctuations feed off themselves. Amplification can easily overwhelm the whole system. That\u8217\'20\'19s exactly what\u8217\'20\'19s occurring today as civilization encounters global peak oil and ever increasing, disastrous, real-time \uc2 climate change\uc2  disasters.\par \par \uc2 When the fluctuations overwhelm a living system, it either collapses or reorganizes itself. A successful living system reorganization will exhibit a higher order of complexity and integration.\par \par \uc2 A city economy that is open and adaptive with interlocking networks that change organically can make sudden, creative leaps into novelty thus reorganizing itself into a higher order of complexity and integration.\par \par \uc2 The localization of the systems for the creation and distribution of sound money would foster free market capitalism on Main Street, where local, shared ownership and local decision-making bring to life economic activity in service of the whole community.\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC43pZkpTec&list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4&index=33"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Michael Saylor}}}\uc2  preaches, \u8220\'20\'1CMoney is economic energy.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The great economic revolutions in history have occurred when new energy regimes converge with communications revolutions. This convergence offers the opportunity to restructure, organize and help maintain the energy flow through the American economic system.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin is the technological gift that can make this local economic living system transformation possible.\par \par \uc2 Saylor also believes that economic energy, like any energy, be it electricity or electromagnetic waves, must travel in a medium as a frequency. With Bitcoin as the monetary systems unit of account, when money flows into an asset, like real estate, its frequency slows and it becomes a store of value.\par \par \uc2 If money is to move rapidly it must maintain a higher frequency and become a currency. Currency is the medium used to move economic energy around.\par \par \uc2 Thus, the challenge becomes how to design a monetary social system, anchored on bitcoin, so that a network of city centered cryptocurrencies can maintain that higher circulatory frequency and stimulate local economic health and well-being.\par \par \uc2 The Challenge Ahead\par \par \uc2 In 1971, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ryzom.substack.com/p/nicholas-georgescu-roegen-the-economic"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen}}}\uc2  proposed the fundamental insight that economic activity is about order creation, and that evolution is the mechanism by which order is created.\par \par \uc2 Building on that work, Eric Beinhocker in his book, \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ardhindie.com/pdf/the-origin-of-wealth"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Origin of Wealth}}}\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D proposed that economic evolution is not a single process but rather the result of three interlinked processes \u8212\'20\'14 physical technology, social system technologies and business or system fitness.\par \par \uc2 Physical Technologies\par \par \uc2 Physical technology is what we are accustomed to think of as technology, things such as bronze making techniques, steam engines, microchips and more recently Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://saifedean.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Saifedean Ammous}}}\uc2  has written, \u8220\'20\'1CBitcoin is a technology that will survive for the same reason the wheel, knife, phone or any type of technology survives. It offers its users benefits from using it. Bitcoin is a spontaneously emergent and autonomous system.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The two technologies that I think most apply to the design of locally controlled, highly networked systems for the exchange of value are Bitcoin and AI information systems. Merge these two technologies into a transparent, city centered, highly networked information system and let this honest money exchange of value system loose into a city-centered free enterprise marketplace.\par \par \uc2 I believe Big Magic will happen.\par \par \uc2 Yet physical technologies are not enough without the other two legs of the stool \u8212\'20\'14 social system technologies and the right business/system design.\par \par \uc2 Social System Technologies\par \par \uc2 Social technologies are ways of organizing people to get work done that takes into account cultural norms. Physical technologies and social technologies co-evolve with each other. The relatively new organizational structure, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/strategy/holacracy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Holacracy}}}\uc2 , is a social technology as is social media and tools like \uc2 Slack\uc2  and Zoom.\par \par \uc2 What are the important social system technologies that need to be integrated into a sound money, city centered, highly networked and transparent system for the exchange of value? This is one of the central challenges in designing a local money system.\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://charleseisenstein.org/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Charles Eisenstein}}}\uc2  has written, \u8220\'20\'1CThe technical challenges of transaction time, scaling and energy use have largely been solved. The socio-political questions have not, and here is the fertile soil for the cultivation of new forms of social accountability and new ways to infuse values into money.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Eisenstein goes on, \u8220\'20\'1CThe true nature of the human being \u8212\'20\'14 indeed, of being itself \u8212\'20\'14 is relationship. Only a system built upon that metaphysical understanding can hope to durably fulfill the hopes that we invest in it.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 To establish a money system by rational processes and through the voluntary cooperation of its users is without precedent. People do not want to understand money; they merely want to use it. This is consistent with their attitude toward all utilities.\par \par \uc2 Business Design/Fitness\par \par \uc2 For the physical and social technologies to have an impact on the world, someone must turn these technologies from concepts into reality, a working social system on Main Street.\par \par \uc2 Business design is how physical and social technologies are expressed in the world in the form of products and services.\par \par \uc2 Businesses are themselves a form of design, and the same can be said for a social system. The design of both encompasses its purpose, its strategy, its ownership, organizational structure, management processes, culture and a host of other factors. Business designs all go through a process of differentiation, selection and amplification, with the market as the ultimate arbiter of fitness.\par \par \uc2 This three-way evolution of physical technologies, social technologies and business/system design account for the patterns of change and growth in any economy.\par \par \uc2 Business/system fitness answers the question, \u8220\'20\'1CCan this system self-sustain?\u8221\'20\'1D A social system like money must be designed to pay its own way or be subsidized in some fashion.\par \par \uc2 Conclusion\par \par \uc2 The challenge we all face is how to reinvent America\u8217\'20\'19s economic operating system so that the current version of \u8220\'20\'1Ctake make waste\u8221\'20\'1D capitalism doesn\u8217\'20\'19t go down in flames and take the rest of us with it.\par \par \uc2 The American bitcoin revolution becomes a force when we allow ourselves to imagine that a new social system design might one day become a collective reality.\par \par \uc2 Said another way \u8212\'20\'14 perhaps the virtues of sound money may inspire a whole new, yet unseen world. Big Magic can happen!\par \par \uc2 As {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://arthuryoung.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Arthur M. Young}}}\uc2 , the inventor of the helicopter, writes in his opus, \u8220\'20\'1CThe Reflexive Universe\u8221\'20\'1D, \u8221\'20\'1DLike the clam, man is buried in the sand with only a dim consciousness of the worlds beyond. Yet potentially he can evolve far beyond his present state; his destiny is unlimited.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 This journey has just begun.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Frank Nuessle.

Initially, it worked with private blockchains too, but that has \u8220\'20\'1Creally decreased over the years,\u8221\'20\'1D Brody told Decrypt.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://content.jwplatform.com/players/U03QVVpr.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click on the link.}}}\par \par \uc2 He elaborated: \u8220\'20\'1CUnlike anybody else, we\u8217\'20\'19re actually building tools and applications in this space, so we built, for example, our own blockchain audit platform, where we can do on-chain and off-chain transaction reconciliation.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 EY\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s in-house arsenal currently contains a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ey.com/en_uk/blockchain-platforms/smart-contract-token-review"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 smart contract testing tool}}}\uc2  developed by its security team in Israel, a system called {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ey.com/en_uk/blockchain-platforms/opschain-traceability"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 EY Ops Chain}}}\uc2  which uses tokenization for traceability and transparency within supply chains, and a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/zero-knowledge-proofs-explained-learn-guide"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Zero Knowledge (ZK)}}}\uc2  Optimistic Layer 2 Rollup for affordable transaction privacy for enterprises.\par \par \uc2 This latter tool was donated into the public domain and refashioned into {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://polygon.technology/solutions/polygon-nightfall/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Polygon Nightfall}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 7 years of \uc2 EY\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s blockchain services\par \par \uc2 Brody chalked \uc2 EY\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s early adoption of crypto down to the fact that senior leadership was convinced of the power of blockchain technology. "This will be the future path for most business-to-business transactions and we need to not just know a little bit about it," said Brody. "We need to be all in.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 According to Brody, roughly 65% of \uc2 EY\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s work in blockchain revolves around audits.\par \par \uc2 The remaining slice is much broader and includes {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/non-fungible-tokens-nfts-explained-guide-learn-blockchain"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 NFT}}}\uc2  tools, food traceability, and improving \uc2 environmental\uc2 , social and governance (ESG) factors. Brody also said the company is building a carbon offset marketplace and carbon tracking tools.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/43115/ey-releases-first-business-application-on-ethereum-blockchain/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 EY Releases First Business Application on Ethereum Blockchain}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe pattern we see over and over again is that companies first want to dip their toe in with something that\u8217\'20\'19s relatively easy. If you\u8217\'20\'19re a bank that means maybe selling Bitcoin and to clients," he said. "Over time they move up to more substantive activities: issuing assets, selling products and services, building {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/defi-ultimate-beginners-guide-decentralized-finance"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 DeFi}}}\uc2  tools. I like to think of it as a slippery slope.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The bear market and Ethereum\par \par \uc2 Finally, Brody spoke at length about how the current bear market affects \uc2 EY\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s blockchain division, adding that its clients in financial services do indeed care about the hefty price fluctuations. Still, he said, they see the volatility as "a feature, not a bug."\par \par \uc2 The industry clients are much different, however. Instead, "they look at Ethereum as a public infrastructure for computing and business operations and what matters to them is the price of gas and the scalability of the network, not the price of the asset.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Brody also said that \uc2 EY\uc2  has taken a \u8220\'20\'1Cvery hard line\u8221\'20\'1D against private blockchains and proprietary technology in spite of what clients may occasionally ask for.\par \par \uc2 This also makes the company especially bullish on Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe made a very strategic decision to only build on Ethereum. I have a limited engineering budget. I want us to be the best on earth at Ethereum\u8212\'20\'14which is the largest market\u8212\'20\'14not pretty good at 20 other things. The best on earth," said Brody. "How long is it gonna take for my competition to adopt this strategy? I hope a really really long time. \u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ey-mainnet-ethereum-e1664539325693-gID_4.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 View image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Document CRYP000020221005ei9u0012z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 There is a reason Fantom (FTM), and Algorand (ALGO) holders are buying into Flasko\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 585 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Several cryptocurrencies have emerged and fallen in the crypto market over the last six months. This month, investors should watch Fantom (FTM), Algorand (ALGO), and Flasko. While Fantom (FTM) and Algorand (ALGO) have survived the market meltdown, Flasko has marched to the moon with its presale triumph. Flasko's worth has increased by 300% during its presale first stage.\par \par \uc2 Fantom (FTM) holders are interested in Flasko (FLSK) presale\par \par \uc2 Fantom (FTM) is one of the projects that have previously earned enormous profits for its investors. However, the current market slump devastated Fantom (FTM), trapping the project in a prolonged bearish period.\par \par \uc2 Fantom (FTM) is now trading at $0.2296. Even though Fantom (FTM) is 92.88% below its all-time high of $3.48, investors are optimistic that the project will recover because there are still many transactions on the platform. In 2019, the Fantom (FTM) platform was made public. Its goal was to enable rapid transactions at lower costs while maintaining high throughput.\par \par \uc2 The year 2021 was the best performance for Fantom (FTM), as the price increased from $0.01 to $3.48 in just over eight months.\par \par \uc2 Algorand (ALGO) investors found a new promising investment with Flasko (FLSK)\par \par \uc2 For several months, the development of Algorand (ALGO) has been a combination of red and green. Though market sentiment has improved in recent months, Algorand (ALGO) still has a lot of ground to cover. Algorand (ALGO) aspires to be a platform that provides speedier transactions by utilizing Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as the consensus mechanism.\par \par \uc2 Algorand (ALGO) has recently announced a new version, Falcon, to enhance transaction volume on the platform and attract additional investors. The update intends to increase Algorand's (ALGO) usefulness and \uc2 sustainability\uc2  in the post-quantum computing age. Nevertheless, investors are still not confident of the project's viability, considering its recent losses.\par \par \uc2 Algorand (ALGO) was trading at $0.3144 at the time of writing, around 91% below its all-time high of $3.28.\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) presale attracts more investors\par \par \uc2 Using the Flasko alternative cryptocurrency, investors can buy NFTs backed by premium, rare and exclusive whisky, expensive champagne, and fine wine. Tis unique and one of a kind initiative is looking to change the way people invest in crypto allowing users to diversify their portfolios.\par \par \uc2 The current cost of the Flasko is $0.04 and likely will rise in the next 48 hours. Within two weeks of the presale beginning, more than 100 million tokens of the project's allotment has been sold, leading to analysts predicting a complete sell out. This has made it one of the most successful pre sales of 2022. Flasko may be able to provide investors with even higher profits, given the predicted 2,000% increase by 2023.\par \par \uc2 Companies can use the Flasko platform to promote and exhibit their top whiskey, wine, and champagne collections. Presale has already begun, and there is a significant demand for Flasko NFTs among consumers of pricey alcoholic beverages.\par \par \uc2 If you're looking for a cryptocurrency with significant long-term growth potential this year, consider investing in Flasko.\par \par \uc2 Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.flasko.io/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://www.flasko.io/}}}\par \par \uc2 Presale: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://presale.flasko.io"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://presale.flasko.io}}}\par \par \uc2 Telegram: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/flaskoio"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.me/flaskoio}}}\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/flasko_io"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/flasko_io}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

\par\par \b \uc2 Examining The Debate Around Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s Role in Palestine\b0\par\par\uc2 2,988 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 September 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 This is an opinion editorial by Seth Cantey, an associate professor of politics, and Mohammed Mourtaja, a Palestinian student studying international economics.\par \par \uc2 A debate is taking shape over whether bitcoin can play a role in Palestinians\u8217\'20\'19 quest for freedom from Israeli occupation. It began a year ago, in September 2021, when Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation Alex Gladstein published \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/can-bitcoin-bring-palestine-freedom"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Can Bitcoin be Palestine\u8217\'20\'19s Currency of Freedom?}}}\uc2  \u8221\'20\'1D on Bitcoin Magazine. The argument goes like this: Bitcoin allows users to securely send, receive and store value without reliance on any third party. In doing so, it enhances personal autonomy and serves as a form of resistance to occupation. In Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s words, \u8220\'20\'1CIt is a peaceful protest, a digital shield, that could lead to big change.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 One of us authors has spent a lot of time down the bitcoin rabbit hole in recent years. The other, newer to bitcoin but well versed after months of intensive research on the topic, is Palestinian and until recently lived in Gaza. We address concerns about the need for caution and qualification in some of Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s arguments toward the end of this article, but in general we agree with him that bitcoin has the potential to play an important role in Palestine\u8217\'20\'19s pursuit of freedom.\par \par \uc2 Not everyone does. Over the past year, knives have come out for this argument. That\u8217\'20\'19s a good thing: More debate is needed on whether and how bitcoin can improve the lives of marginalized people, not less. But the quality of debate matters. Too often, analysts make points that are misinformed, usually a consequence of not putting in the work to understand a place or technology, and sometimes they misdirect readers to score points. A recent article includes both kinds of bad takes and is worthy of a considered response. In our critique below, we highlight the kinds of points that critics are getting wrong and try to model analysis that can be taken seriously by scholars, policymakers, and the general public.\par \par \uc2 A Critic Takes Aim\par \par \uc2 In July, Hadas Thier \u8212\'20\'14 a writer and activist published in The Nation and Jacobin among other outlets \u8212\'20\'14 responded to Gladstein in an article titled \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://merip.org/2022/07/bitcoin-cannot-free-palestine/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bitcoin Cannot Free Palestine}}}\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D Writing for the Middle East Research and Information Project (MERIP), a non-profit independent research group, Thier acknowledges the \u8220\'20\'1Curgent and necessary pursuit of Palestinian financial independence,\u8221\'20\'1D which she characterizes as \u8220\'20\'1Cindisputable.\u8221\'20\'1D But she argues that bitcoin should have no role in that pursuit. There is a \u8220\'20\'1Cyawning chasm between the far-reaching promises made by Gladstein and others and the actual technological capabilities of cryptocurrencies,\u8221\'20\'1D she writes. These \u8220\'20\'1Cfaux-humanitarian promises\u8221\'20\'1D only offer Palestinians \u8220\'20\'1Cdangerous economic and political risks.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Those who have spent time in the space will already smell a problem. The title of Thier\u8217\'20\'19s article refers to the role of bitcoin in Palestine, but she conflates bitcoin with cryptocurrencies throughout. The word \u8220\'20\'1Cbitcoin\u8221\'20\'1D appears more than thirty times in the article, but some version of \u8220\'20\'1Ccrypto\u8221\'20\'1D appears just as often. Thier mostly uses crypto as an adjective: crypto adherents, proponents, enthusiasts, cheerleaders, millionaires, projects, assets, wallets, payments, entrepreneurs, transactions, exchanges, etc. Bitcoiners have long been at pains to distinguish between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; indeed, this is the raison d'\u234\'00\'EAtre for the term \u8220\'20\'1Caltcoin.\u8221\'20\'1D Bitcoin is the oldest, most decentralized, most secure and most widely adopted blockchain, one with a known and immutable monetary policy and a fixed supply. These characteristics meaningfully distinguish bitcoin from its competitors. To the extent that any nation-state has expressed even the prospect of adopting a digital currency not backed by a central bank, only one has been considered: bitcoin. In 2021, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.npr.org/2021/09/07/1034838909/bitcoin-el-salvador-legal-tender-official-currency-cryptocurrency"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 El Salvador}}}\uc2  crossed that Rubicon. Earlier this year, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-adopts-bitcoin-an-official-currency-2022-04-27/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Central African Republic}}}\uc2  did the same.\par \par \uc2 Beyond injecting crypto into a conversation about bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s role in Palestine, much of Thier\u8217\'20\'19s argument rests on criticisms that, she claims, make the asset unsuitable for adoption. Cryptocurrencies, she writes, are characterized by \u8220\'20\'1Cwild volatility, inbuilt inequalities, \uc2 environmental\uc2  consequences and associations with criminal activity.\u8221\'20\'1D Assuming for a moment that she means bitcoin specifically (not cryptocurrencies generally), there is some truth in each of these allegations. On balance, though, they are unconvincing. Let\u8217\'20\'19s go through each briefly.\par \par \uc2 First, it\u8217\'20\'19s no surprise that an asset as small as bitcoin, which trades 24/7 in perhaps the world\u8217\'20\'19s only truly free market, is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://hbr.org/2022/07/what-skeptics-get-wrong-about-cryptos-volatility"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 volatile}}}\uc2 . But volatility goes both ways. A dozen years ago the price of bitcoin was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 under $1}}}\uc2 . Today it\u8217\'20\'19s around $20,000. For the vast majority of the past decade and more, it has been a lucrative investment. While that doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mean the future will look like the past, the word volatility need not be a pejorative. If we are watching the monetization of a new asset, a new money \u8212\'20\'14 and that may be exactly what we\u8217\'20\'19re watching \u8212\'20\'14 then early adopters will benefit disproportionately. It shouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be a surprise that developing countries, which tend to suffer more in the existing international financial system, are thinking harder about alternatives than developed ones.\par \par \uc2 Second, inbuilt inequality through pre-mines, pre-sales, etc. has been at the heart of nearly all cryptocurrency launches. That was not the case for bitcoin, however, which arguably had the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/why-bitcoin-fair-launch-is-important"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fairest launch}}}\uc2  of any, and whose creator, as far as we know, has never profited. We recently heard it put this way: \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  was a buyer of bitcoin, not a seller. They purchased hardware and electricity to secure the bitcoin network, disappeared and have never touched the block rewards they received. And while it is true that some early investors in bitcoin profited immensely \u8212\'20\'14 this is typical of early investors in any successful technology \u8212\'20\'14 bitcoin wealth is becoming {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ecommerceinstitut.de/bitcoin-wealth/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 more evenly distributed over time}}}\uc2 . That stands in contrast to wealth distribution trends generally. According to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://equitablegrowth.org/the-u-s-economy-is-in-its-fourth-decade-of-rising-inequality-amid-the-need-for-more-accurate-data-on-its-consequences/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recent data}}}\uc2  from the \uc2 U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis\uc2 , for example, the United States is currently in its \u8220\'20\'1Cfourth straight decade of rising income and wealth inequality.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Third, the purported \uc2 environmental\uc2  consequences of bitcoin are serious, well known and much discussed. They can also be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-track-consume-worlds-energy-2020-744036"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 exaggerated}}}\uc2 . Anyone who says the protocol\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 environmental\uc2  footprint is insignificant or unimportant is wrong, but often critics begin with the assumption that any energy the protocol uses is wasted. In fact, all monetary systems use energy, including the petrodollar system. Citing data from the \uc2 University of Cambridge\uc2 , Lyn Alden notes that the bitcoin network currently accounts for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-energy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 less than 0.1% of global energy consumption}}}\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CIn the very long run,\u8221\'20\'1D she writes, \u8220\'20\'1Cif Bitcoin is wildly successful and becomes a systemically important asset and payment system used by over a billion people at 10-20x its current market capitalization, it should reach several tenths of one percent of global energy usage.\u8221\'20\'1D If it fails, on the other hand, \u8220\'20\'1Cits energy usage will stagnate and shrink as the block subsidies continue to diminish.\u8221\'20\'1D Three questions, then, should be at the center of any discussion about bitcoin and the environment. First, is the energy dedicated to securing the network in pursuit of better money worth the \uc2 environmental\uc2  consequences, especially for the large part of humanity that desperately needs better money? Second, how do positive trends in renewable energy adoption within bitcoin mining affect that calculation? Third, could bitcoin meaningfully contribute to climate solutions over time, for example through {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-05-03/methane-is-a-big-climate-problem-that-bitcoin-can-help-solve"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 flare mitigation}}}\uc2  or the capture of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://vespene.energy/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 vented methane}}}\uc2 ? We believe the answers to all three questions favor the continued exploration of this technology, including its proof-of-work consensus mechanism.\par \par \uc2 Finally, it is true that bitcoin has been associated with criminal activity, and that association will never go away entirely. The same can be said for the U.S. dollar. But the \uc2 FBI\uc2  isn\u8217\'20\'19t worried about bitcoin. It worries instead about vulnerabilities in smart contracts. Citing data from \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 , a recent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220829"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 public service announcement}}}\uc2  by the Bureau notes that of $1.3 billion in cryptocurrencies stolen from investors in the first quarter of this year, almost 97% was stolen from DeFi platforms. The percentage of activity on the bitcoin network associated with criminal activity, in contrast, is declining. According to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptoforinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/An-Analysis-of-Bitcoins-Use-in-Illicit-Finance-By-Michael-Morell.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recent report}}}\uc2  by former acting CIA director Michael Morel, \u8220\'20\'1CThe broad generalizations about the use of Bitcoin in illicit finance are significantly overstated.\u8221\'20\'1D Indeed, the transparent nature of public blockchains means they can even be useful to law enforcement. In Morel\u8217\'20\'19s words, \u8220\'20\'1CBlockchain analysis is a highly effective crime fighting and intelligence gathering tool.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 So Thier\u8217\'20\'19s article seems to have been written without a grasp of differences between key technologies (i.e., bitcoin as a subset of, and not the same as, crypto) and without a sense of known rebuttals to common criticisms of bitcoin. Another kind of problem in her analysis is the straw man argument. On several occasions, Thier cites an interview she conducted with Sara Roy, a senior research scholar at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at Harvard and an authority on the Palestinian economy. She frames Roy\u8217\'20\'19s comments both as contra-Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s argument and in support of her own. It may be that Roy doesn\u8217\'20\'19t agree with Gladstein on bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s role in Palestine, and that she does agree with Thier, but that is impossible to know based on how Roy\u8217\'20\'19s views are presented. Quoting Thier:\par \par \uc2 "I spoke to Roy about Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s article. She strenuously disagreed with the notion that 'cryptocurrency is somehow impervious to the political reality in which Palestinians and Israelis reside' or that it could 'give dispossessed Palestinians parity with empowered Israelis, eliminating the gross asymmetries of power between them and granting Palestinians economic sovereignty.'"\par \par \uc2 Of course Roy disagreed with these notions. Even the most hardened bitcoin maximalist would. Gladstein did not write these things, has not said them and would not agree with them. The suggestion in Thier\u8217\'20\'19s article is that she presented Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s argument to Roy, who forcefully objected to it. But the relevant quotation is not attributed to Gladstein for good reason; the thoughts aren\u8217\'20\'19t his. This kind of analysis is either an unfortunate attempt to bolster an argument by misdirecting the reader or a gross misunderstanding of what bitcoin advocates believe the currency\u8217\'20\'19s adoption in Palestine could achieve.\par \par \uc2 A final critique relates to a big topic, one squeezed into just two sentences in Thier\u8217\'20\'19s analysis. \u8220\'20\'1CIn a best-case scenario,\u8221\'20\'1D she writes, \u8220\'20\'1Csome individuals from the Palestinian middle class \u8212\'20\'14 nearly non-existent in Gaza and struggling in the West Bank \u8212\'20\'14 could benefit from receiving international payments or remittances in bitcoin. But given the wild volatility in the value of cryptocurrencies, it will more likely harm those taking on the risk.\u8221\'20\'1D One of us has direct experience with remittances in Palestine and knows what it\u8217\'20\'19s like to lose money to middlemen \u8212\'20\'14 be they banks, governments, or \uc2 Western Union\uc2 . A recent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.knomad.org/sites/default/files/2022-05/Migration%20and%20Development%20Brief%2036_May%202022_0.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 World Bank report}}}\uc2  shows that last year $3.5 billion dollars\u8217\'20\'19 worth of remittances entered the West Bank and Gaza, accounting for 20% of Palestinian GPD. Unemployment in those territories hovers around 16% and 47%, respectively, and GDP per capita in Palestine overall is around {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PSE/west-bank-and-gaza/gdp-per-capita"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $3,600}}}\uc2 . In other words, this affects everyone. When $1,000 turns into $920 because of transaction fees, or when $100 turns into $92, families and individuals who may earn the equivalent of only a few dollars per day feel those effects acutely. But only after a substantial delay. Transferring fiat to Gaza can take weeks.\par \par \uc2 Does bitcoin fix this? Maybe, and in the future it certainly could. If someone wants to send bitcoin to Gaza right now, they can do so with a smartphone. Via the Lightning Network, the transaction fee is essentially free. Almost immediately, that bitcoin will land in someone\u8217\'20\'19s wallet on the ground. It can be transferred to \uc2 Binance\uc2  and converted to the stablecoin Tether (USDT) before being cashed out for Israeli Shekels at a currency exchange office. All of this can happen quickly \u8212\'20\'14 much faster than any fiat transfer \u8212\'20\'14 with minimal risk posed by volatility. In the future, if and when a company like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://strike.me/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Strike}}}\uc2  is operating in Palestine, fiat-to-fiat transfers across the bitcoin network could become common and replace the need for alternatives entirely.\par \par \uc2 Before shifting to our own critique of Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s argument, we want to acknowledge that Thier makes several points that we agree with. First, bitcoin is not a cure-all for the ills of Palestinians or any other people. Second, \u8220\'20\'1CThe monetary relationship between Israel and the Palestinians reflects a more fundamental asymmetry of power.\u8221\'20\'1D Third, \u8220\'20\'1CAn independent Palestinian economy will not arise magically out of a sovereign currency, digital or otherwise. It can only come about through the capacity to produce and trade goods and services, which has been systematically undermined through the destruction of physical infrastructure and the elimination of a geographical basis on which Palestinian capital accumulation could effectively take place.\u8221\'20\'1D These things are true. The question is whether informed bitcoin adoption has the potential to help Palestinians pursue economic freedom. We believe that it does and would encourage Thier to speak with those who have interacted with bitcoin in Palestine, as Gladstein and we have. Unfortunately, no Palestinians were interviewed for her article.\par \par \uc2 Getting The Debate Back On Track\par \par \uc2 This topic matters. Over the past dozen years, bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s market cap has grown exponentially, and the pace of cryptocurrency adoption \u8212\'20\'14 a majority or plurality of which has always been bitcoin \u8212\'20\'14 has exploded in developing countries in particular. The \uc2 United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\uc2  (\uc2 UNCTAD\uc2 ), which advocates for increased regulation of cryptocurrency to mitigate investment risks in the sector, notes in a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/presspb2022d8_en.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recent report}}}\uc2  that 15 of the top 20 economies globally, in terms of digital currency ownership as a share of the population, are in emerging market and developing countries. In other words, the current global financial system is not working for many of the world\u8217\'20\'19s poor, who are increasingly looking for alternatives.\par \par \uc2 Topics that matter generate debate, and Gladstein is to be commended for kicking this one off. He is a thoughtful analyst, his arguments hold up well to the criticism articulated in Their\u8217\'20\'19s critique, and his work has attracted attention for good reason. He has also authored a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://store.bitcoinmagazine.com/collections/books/products/check-your-financial-privilege"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 book}}}\uc2  that explores the use of bitcoin by people throughout the developing world, among other topics, which we believe is well worth reading.\par \par \uc2 But we also want to sound a note of caution. Often analysts become advocates and, while that is not a problem per se, advocacy can undermine analysis. We have seen some of that in Gladstein\u8217\'20\'19s work. In his book, for example, Gladstein draws on Greek history to paint bitcoin as a kind of Trojan Horse:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CBitcoin will continue to gain worldwide adoption because of its effectiveness as digital gold, but hidden within the prized Trojan Horse is a remarkable freedom technology. At this point, the reader may think Bitcoin proponents must be saying, \u8216\'20\'18Quiet in the back! Keep the noise down. We just need to last a few more hours until midnight, and then we can pop ourselves out of this horse and let the rest of our army into Troy.\u8217\'20\'19 But it is already too late. There is nothing the Trojans can do.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The analogy continues:\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMany authoritarians, central bankers, and establishmentarians may already realize what is concealed in Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s Trojan Horse. There are plenty of modern Laoco\u246\'00\'F6ns and Cassandras saying, \u8216\'20\'18We need to stop this thing!\u8217\'20\'19 But, just like in the kingdoms of lore, these words will fall on deaf ears. The prize glitters too bright.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The suggestion here is that bitcoin is inevitable, that the steady march to global adoption and the implications of that \u8212\'20\'14 both for \u8220\'20\'1Cnumber go up\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1Cfreedom go up\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 are already baked into the cake. The truth is that that future is far from certain. Bitcoin continues to face a variety of risks, from the internal to the external to the local. Will a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.lynalden.com/bitcoin-security-modeling/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 fee market}}}\uc2  develop over time to replace the block reward that has so far been essential to bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s security? What of the policymakers and regulators in the \uc2 U.S. Congress\uc2  and beyond, not to mention those in Europe, who seem determined to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2022.07.15%20Letter%20to%20EPA%20and%20DOE%20Re%20Cryptomining%20Environmental%20Impacts.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 regulate proof-of-work mining}}}\uc2  out of existence? And in a place like Palestine, where electricity (and thus access to the internet) can be intermittent, and is mostly controlled by Israel, what would bootstrapping a resistance economy based on bitcoin really look like?\par \par \uc2 One can believe that bitcoin is freedom technology, that adoption will continue and that Palestine (and other places) will benefit from increased adoption over time. One can also believe that the ability to opt into a free and open, censorship-resistant monetary system offers Palestinians something important and in desperately short supply on the ground: dignity. The autonomy of choice in a context of occupation. And one can believe that Palestinian investments into bitcoin today will reap rewards over the long term. As it happens, we believe these things. But to argue that the game is already won, that widespread adoption of bitcoin in Palestine or elsewhere is inevitable, is to encourage uninformed adoption. People who accept and act on that argument are likely to take risks they don\u8217\'20\'19t fully understand.\par \par \uc2 To his credit, Gladstein has also used more measured language when talking and writing about bitcoin and Palestine. Indeed, his article is framed as a question \u8212\'20\'14 \u8220\'20\'1CCan Bitcoin Be Palestine\u8217\'20\'19s Currency of Freedom?\u8221\'20\'1D \u8212\'20\'14 rather than an answer. We agree with his suggestion that the answer could be yes, and hope to work alongside him and others to create the fair and just reality that Palestinians deserve.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Seth Cantey and Mohammed Mourtaja.

They enable a user-owned economy that lets players resell and potentially profit from digital assets, plus such tokenized, interoperable assets can potentially be used across multiple games and online worlds.\par \par \uc2 But there\u8217\'20\'19s one big problem: many gamers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/92929/ftx-vc-amy-wu-how-crypto-nft-gamers-can-get-along"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 absolutely hate NFTs}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Vocal fans from the traditional gaming space have pushed back against companies like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/88880/after-backlash-ubisoft-calls-gaming-nfts-a-major-change-that-will-take-time"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ubisoft}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/91788/worms-game-ethereum-nfts-canceled-after-backlash"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Team17}}}\uc2  as they\u8217\'20\'19ve explored the NFT space, and many view the industry as a hotbed for scams and speculation. The \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact of NFTs has been a common complaint as well, although {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/109623/ethereum-merge-ends-environmental-debate-nfts"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 that argument is effectively dead}}}\uc2  following the recent {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-merge-ethereum-move-proof-stake"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum merge}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On top of all that, some believe that game publishers will simply use NFTs as another way to extract even more value from players. The backlash to NFTs is similar to that levied against free-to-play games and downloadable add-on content when those respective business models were introduced, and now both are widely-accepted industry standards.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/110185/magic-eden-ceo-very-natural-to-expand-from-solana-to-ethereum-nfts/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Magic Eden CEO: \u8216\'20\'18Very Natural\u8217\'20\'19 to Expand From Solana to Ethereum NFTs}}}\par \par \uc2 Even amid the vitriol, NFT marketplace {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/110185/magic-eden-ceo-very-natural-to-expand-from-solana-to-ethereum-nfts"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Magic Eden}}}\uc2  still sees long-term potential in gaming NFTs. Magic Eden, which was launched one year ago and was {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/103403/solana-nft-marketplace-magic-eden-raises-130m-plans-multi-chain-expansion"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 valued at $1.6 billion in June}}}\uc2 , is the leading marketplace for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-solana-a-scalable-decentralized-network-for-dapps"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Solana}}}\uc2  NFTs and recently {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/106405/solana-unicorn-magic-eden-nft-marketplace-ethereum"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 expanded into the Ethereum market}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 On the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/videos/interviews/XeO80zrF/gm-inside-nft-unicorn-magic-eden-with-ceo-jack-lu"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 latest episode of Decrypt\u8217\'20\'19s gm podcast}}}\uc2 , Magic Eden co-founder and CEO Jack Lu told co-hosts Daniel Roberts and Stephen Graves that despite the skepticism from players, he believes that NFTs \u8220\'20\'1Cunlock something completely new for gaming developers to build an economy and build a new business model on.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Magic Eden has supported a wide array of NFT-based gaming projects through both its launchpad feature and secondary marketplace, including upcoming titles like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/95627/block-tackle-solana-nft-skateboarding-game-skatex-coinbase-animoca"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SkateX}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/88757/solana-game-mini-royale-nations-hits-2m-players-nft-launch"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Mini Royale: Nations}}}\uc2 , and BR1: Battle Royale.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://content.jwplatform.com/players/XeO80zrF.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click on the link.}}}\par \par \uc2 In July, the firm launched a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/104902/solana-nft-marketplace-magic-eden-launches-gaming-venture-arm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 gaming-focused venture investment arm}}}\uc2  with an aim to help lure game developers to Magic Eden. Part of the marketplace\u8217\'20\'19s approach is to build simple integrations so that developers can put the Magic Eden platform within their games. That way, users can buy and sell NFTs without leaving the in-game experience.\par \par \uc2 Lu admitted that there\u8217\'20\'19s \u8220\'20\'1Cso much to unpack\u8221\'20\'1D around gamers\u8217\'20\'19 perceptions of NFTs, including the presence of bad actors in the industry and the increasing financialization of digital assets. Also, as a nascent space built around decentralized technology, it\u8217\'20\'19s no surprise that many early NFT-powered games have been simplistic, falling short of some players\u8217\'20\'19 expectations.\par \par \uc2 The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum}}}\uc2  -based {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-axie-infinity-the-play-to-earn-nft-game-taking-crypto-by-storm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Axie Infinity}}}\uc2 , for example, is the biggest success story in the space with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptoslam.io/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 over $4 billion worth of NFT trading volume}}}\uc2 , and millions of active players at its peak last year. But the monster-battling gameplay was also decried for its repetitive nature, and the game\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/92190/axie-infinity-making-big-changes-to-fix-its-ailing-play-to-earn-nft-economy"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 play-to-earn economy collapsed}}}\uc2  amid the growing hype.

Large-scale video games often take years to build, and are supported by sizable development teams.\par \par \uc2 Lu said that his team is \u8220\'20\'1Cwaiting for a few diamonds to come, to shine\u8221\'20\'1D\u8212\'20\'14that is, great games that showcase NFT functionality\u8212\'20\'14to help spread adoption across the gaming industry.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CGreat games take a long time to build\u8212\'20\'14it takes vision, inspiration, and a lot of dev time to build that much content,\u8221\'20\'1D he explained. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are effectively waiting for the most promising game studios to have that time to build out their content, and then work out what is the secret sauce of how to use NFTs in that.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Lu suggested that once a few of those so-called diamonds hit the market and thrive, they\u8217\'20\'19ll serve as a \u8220\'20\'1Ccase study\u8221\'20\'1D to nudge other developers into the NFT space. He described it as a potential \u8220\'20\'1Ctidal wave that follows the paradigm shifts of the past\u8221\'20\'1D in the gaming world, such as the shift to free-to-play games.\par \par \uc2 Listen to the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://open.spotify.com/episode/4W94OHKhFNXHvPTuGCcvU4?si=6f2844702149422d"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 full episode}}}\uc2  of the gm podcast wherever you get your podcasts, and make sure to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/podcast"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 subscribe}}}\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/GM_Podcastcover_JackL4-gID_4.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 View image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Document CRYP000020221005ei9t00105\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw264\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3960\pichgoal600

However, the lack of traction on the market caused a large reversal. XRP dropped by more than 20%, which is around half of the growth it has shown in the last 30 days. Despite the spike in trading volume, traders and investors were not injecting a significant amount of funds into the assets. Therefore, XRP had no fundamental support beneath it moving up. The volume profile on XRP continues to decline due to traders' lack of confidence in the rally's \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , especially given the lack of positive news about \uc2 Ripple\uc2 's success in court.\par \par \uc2 Amazon SHIB burner: next few days may be crucial for burning record amount of SHIB\par \par \uc2 According to the announcement by @shib_superstore \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account, smartphone game maker {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/amazon-shib-burner-next-few-days-may-be-crucial-for-burning-record-amount-of-shib"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Travis Johnson}}}\uc2  is going to break August\u8217\'20\'19s record of the amount of SHIB burned if, in the next few days, he adds a large chunk of the meme tokens to what has already been burned this month. Among the tools he uses to achieve this is \uc2 Amazon\uc2 's affiliate program. On Sunday, the SHIB burn platform managed to destroy 5,364,995 Shiba Inu meme coins. So far this month, as stated in Johnson\u8217\'20\'19s Monday tweet, roughly 187 million meme coins have been sent to dead-end wallets. This amount of SHIB equals $2,007 in fiat and was earned on advertisements in games and on selling SHIB-branded merch and goods. The \uc2 Amazon\uc2  affiliate program has been the second biggest earner this month for the platform.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=183269;size=336x280;setID=558953"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here}}}\par \par \uc2 Ads\par \par \uc2 XRP will explode if this happens, David Gokhshtein repeats as he considers grabbing more XRP\par \par \uc2 In a recent tweet, founder of Gokhshtein Media and crypto enthusiast {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/xrp-will-explode-if-this-happens-david-gokhshtein-repeats-as-he-considers-grabbing-more-xrp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 David Gokhshtein}}}\uc2  has shared an idea he has been holding onto since October 2021: If \uc2 Ripple\uc2  wins, this victory will become a driver for a major price rise of XRP. Gokhshtein admitted that he is "being repetitive," also adding that he feels like buying more XRP before its price explodes. Another favorite belief of Gokhshtein is that should \uc2 Ripple\uc2  win against the SEC regulatory agency, it will not only give XRP a major boost but also inspire the entire crypto industry to skyrocket. XRP is not the only altcoin that David Gokhshtein has been supporting. He often mentions SHIB and Dogecoin in his tweets. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/still-got-bags-of-doge-waiting-for-price-to-go-parabolic-david-gokhshtein"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 As reported by U.Today}}}\uc2  today, Gokhshtein remains bullish on Dogecoin, tweeting that he still holds a lot of DOGE.\par \par \uc2 IOTA's Shimmer Network officially launches\par \par \uc2 According to the official announcement, after two months of beta testing, the IOTA Foundation's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/iotas-shimmer-network-officially-launches-details"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Shimmer Network}}}\uc2  (a sandbox for IOTA community developers at its core) was launched on the main network yesterday. Thanks to Shimmer, users will have a lot of opportunities to tokenize anything from real-world assets to fan tokens natively on the Layer 1 blockchain without any fees. Also, users who received Shimmer\u8217\'20\'19s native cryptocurrency, SMR tokens, will be able to claim them via Firefly Wallet. SMR is the backbone of the Shimmer Network, providing transaction value and allowing all the necessary decentralized applications, smart contracts and other developer "wants" to run on Shimmer.\par \par \uc2 Document UTDAY00020220929ei9t000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw264\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3960\pichgoal600

This was certainly important for Balmain as well, given the latest trends in the fashion world that focus on \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , \uc2 environmental\uc2 , social and corporate responsibility.\par \par \uc2 A total of 10,000 Balmain NFT memberships will be available. Their holders will be able to gain access to real and virtual events from the fashion house, rewards, as well as achieving greater immersion in Balmain life.\par \par \uc2 Fashion world loves Web3 technology\par \par \uc2 News of Balmain's breakthrough Web3 via NFT at XRPL is far from the only event bringing together new digital technologies and the fashion world lately.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=183269;size=336x280;setID=558953"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here}}}\par \par \uc2 Ads\par \par \uc2 In the past few months, a host of other luxury brands, whether {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/apecoin-now-accepted-by-fashion-giant-gucci?amp"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Gucci}}}\uc2  or \uc2 Tag Heuer\uc2 , have announced that they are starting to accept cryptocurrencies as a way to pay for their products.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of NFT, it is not an old story when fashion designer John Richmond co-launched his collection inspired by super-hyped {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/shiba-inu-to-feature-in-milan-fashion-week-in-collaboration-with-john-richmond"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 cryptocurrency Shiba Inu}}}\uc2  at Milan Fashion Week with a virtual asset-themed collection.\par \par \uc2 Document UTDAY00020220928ei9s000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 MetaBlaze Brings Immersive Storytelling and Engaging Experiences to Web3 \u8211\'20\'13 The Next Trend In Web3 & Play to Earn Gaming\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 1,406 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Web3 is the biggest innovation for the online community. From the Metaverse to play to earn and NFT games, web3 is a rapidly emerging force in the world of technology and companies like MetaBlaze are bringing age old storytelling to the new age web.\par \par \uc2 Web3 is a novel iteration of the World Wide Web, which integrates blockchain technology and crypto concepts like decentralization and token-based economics. Web 3.0 applications allow users to build, operate and own their creations. In essence, the goal of web3 is to give power to individuals rather than corporations.\par \par \uc2 Web3 is fast gaining an edge in the global arena, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a huge part of the change. NFTs started as aesthetically pleasing or intriguing art that people bought, sold, or held in a collection.\par \par \uc2 The progress in blockchain gaming has been very significant so far. Today, NFTs are a core part of crypto games like Axie Infinity, Gods Unchained, and Splinterlands. These blockchain games reward players with cryptocurrencies called GameFi tokens or NFT collectibles that can be used for several gaming activities.\par \par \uc2 Several crypto game models include play to earn NFT games like The Sandbox and move-to-earn like StepN. The next trend in the blockchain gaming industry is storytelling. Storytelling is an innovative feature that increases the user experience for gamers and helps build a thriving community.\par \par \uc2 This article explores how important and valuable storytelling is in blockchain games and how gaming crypto companies like MetaBlaze are leveraging it to further immerse its community, create virtual experiences, in addition to IRL events to further enhance the overall gaming experience, one that follows a narrative of epic proportions, potentially the first iconic story to have unfolded in the Web3 world.\par \par \uc2 Importance and Value of Storytelling in Web3\par \par \uc2 2021 was very favorable for NFT games. The NFT market surpassed $24.9 billion in trading volume in, an explosive growth compared to $95 million in 2020. The rise of web3 has given creators opportunities to create, own and sell their digital items to their community. As we approach the end of 2022 \u8211\'20\'13 Play to Earn is poised for tremendous growth as we transition into 2023.\par \par \uc2 In addition, another aspect of storytelling in Web3 involves providing the opportunity for collaborative narrative writing among a community. While this is popular in Web2 as fan fiction and \uc2 YouTube\uc2  creations, web3 takes it further by adding economic benefits in a scalable manner.\par \par \uc2 According to the co-founder and chairman of \uc2 Animoca Brands\uc2 , \uc2 Yat Siu\uc2 , Web3 allows content creators like artists, writers, designers, and others to collaborate with community members on various creative activities.\par \par \uc2 For example, \uc2 Warner Bros. Entertainment\uc2  launched a Batman NFT collection as a way to make Batman come to life for fans. Each NFT was designed to be a useful tool in creating the narrative for future DC comics. The NFT collection called the Bat Cowl Collection contains unique traits that allow fans to create unique looks in different worlds using their cowls. These newly created looks will now be used to create the stories behind the cowls.\par \par \uc2 It's hardly surprising that traditional web 2 companies are pushing hard into the web 3.0 space. Popular game company, \uc2 GameStop\uc2 , is a good example. Although recent figures have been underwhelming, \uc2 GameStop\uc2  NFTs are a big thing in the crypto games space.\par \par \uc2 Storytelling is helping web3 brands to empower both the creators and the community. Additionally, brand storytelling is important for companies to build an emotional connection with their customers. Let's see how MetaBlaze is building its ecosystem around storytelling.\par \par \uc2 How MetaBlaze is Leveraging Storytelling for Brand Awareness and Experience\par \par \uc2 What is MetaBlaze?\par \par \uc2 MetaBlaze is a crypto gaming platform that is leading by example and is one of the best cryptocurrencies to buy now.

If you're looking for a cryptocurrency to buy now, MetaBlaze should be at the top of your list.\par \par \uc2 Galaxia Blue- The Story Behind MetaBlaze's Play to Earn Games\par \par \uc2 The Blaziverse dApp (decentralized application) is the Web 3.0 hub of MetaBlaze's ecosystem. It's the platform where you participate in mini-games events and activities centered around the narrative of Galaxia Blue.\par \par \uc2 Galaxia Blue is the core foundation on which the story of MetaBlaze's gaming ecosystem is based, and it begins like this.\par \par \uc2 "In the year 2126, after centuries of unrest, the age of technological singularity led to civil war among factions of cybernetic armies.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The story continues with the arrival of the MetaGoblins on the SES moon, a strange and mysterious blue Moon with loads of Terranzinite crystal. The objective of the MetaGoblins is to find the best way to harvest the crystals from the treacherous landscapes of the moon and send them home to rebuild their dying planet, Glozark.\par \par \uc2 And that's where the players come in. In the Metaminez players game, players can deploy their MetaGoblin NFTs into mine. Players are tasked with extracting Terranzinite crystals from one of four crystal mines located on the SES moon. In exchange for Terranzinite, players are rewarded with blue-chip cryptos such as: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Binance Coin (BNB), Solana (SOL) & more.\par \par \uc2 The MetaMinez game is one of several play to earn crypto games within the Blaziverse dApp. Users holding the MetaGoblin NFTs and the $MBLZ tokens will access existing interactive and immersive gameplays and upcoming creations.

\par\par \b \uc2 Dusk Network prepares for upcoming EU crypto regulation (MiCA)\b0\par\par\uc2 Laurie Dunn \par \uc2 1,953 \uc2 words\par \uc2 26 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Extremely comprehensive legislative changes for the crypto sector are close to being implemented. Dusk Network is preparing for them, and in a series of articles on the subject, seeks to help the broader crypto community to understand its obligations in what can potentially be a difficult and complex transition into a new regulatory environment.\par \par \uc2 Dusk Network is a tip-of-the-spear project building a privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain from the ground up. At the same time as making ground-breaking advances in zero-knowledge technology, Dusk Network provides fully compliant smart contracts for businesses that need their privacy to be preserved.\par \par \uc2 Since early July of this year, Ryan King of Dusk Network has written and published a series of 5 articles aimed at breaking down the EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto Assets) regulation, which will have far-reaching implications for all crypto projects that wish to operate in the EU.\par \par \uc2 Key Terminology\par \par \uc2 The first article looks at how MiCA defines the various types of crypto assets, which can be confusing as they differ from what most in the industry understand them as.\par \par \uc2 There is no legal meaning to the word \u8216\'20\'18stablecoin\u8217\'20\'19 in the classifications, and this has been split into two categories: EMT (Electronic Money Token), and ART (Asset-Referenced Token). Neither algorithmically-backed tokens, nor security tokens, nor NFTs have been included in the classifications.\par \par \uc2 Who cares about MiCA?\par \par \uc2 In the second article Dusk Network looks at the various stakeholders as regards the MiCA regulation.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Union\par \par \uc2 The MiCA regulation takes into account the potential that stablecoins may have for inflationary effects on currency. Therefore MiCA includes strict clauses that oblige stablecoin issuers to ringfence their assets and have them frequently audited.\par \par \uc2 The article covers how there is potential for various scams and abuses in the crypto sector, and that when these take place investors look to their governments for protection and assistance, giving the EU the chance to step in and take enforcement actions under the incoming MiCA regulations.\par \par \uc2 It looks as if the EU is seeking to build a regulated and transparent ecosystem of crypto assets where companies can set up with the full knowledge that guidelines are clear across the whole 27 countries that make up the union.\par \par \uc2 The finance industry\par \par \uc2 The clear guidelines to be put in place with MiCA aim to allow TradFi and DeFi to co-mingle without any barriers, and in full compliance.\par \par \uc2 Dusk Network\par \par \uc2 A stated aim of Dusk Network is to give everyone full control over all their digital assets, so it recognises that MiCA can be a step in the right direction.\par \par \uc2 By building compliance in at the foundational level users will have the confidence that Dusk Network services can be accessed without having to worry if they meet regulations. With this in mind, Dusk Network will continue to observe MiCA and any other EU regulations with close attention.\par \par \uc2 What MiCA means for you\par \par \uc2 The third article in the series looks at the requirements for new crypto projects. The MiCA regulations are not retroactive and so will only apply to projects that are launched once the regulations are in place at some point in 2023.\par \par \uc2 The MiCA regulations want to make a project\u8217\'20\'19s whitepaper a legally binding document. All relevant information needs to be in a whitepaper and any promises made within it are binding and have to be carried out or consequences will result.\par \par \uc2 There will also be rules for CASPs (Crypto Asset Service Providers) in that they must register a legal entity in any one of the 27 EU member states. They must show that they have enough funds in order to carry out planned operations; and they must demonstrate evidence of proper compliance.\par \par \uc2 Stablecoins are redefined\par \par \uc2 Although MiCA makes frequent reference to stablecoins, it does not legally define the word. Instead, two types of stablecoins are categorised, which are Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs) and Asset-referenced Tokens (ARTs).\par \par \uc2 The rules recognise that EMTs are a one-for-one equivalence, with one electronic euro having the same value as a physical euro. They must also be backed by only one fiat currency.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, an Asset-Referenced Token is denominated in a single currency, but is backed by any combination of two or more fiat currencies, one or more cryptocurrencies, and/or one or more other assets.\par \par \uc2 Right of redemption\par \par \uc2 Within the MiCA regulations but stemming from the 2014 EU Consumer Rights Directive, is the right of redemption after sale, within a 2-week cooling off period. This gives the right to a full refund without any valid reason, as long as funds are returned in their original form. This law will apply equally to both EMTs, ARTs, and any crypto assets.\par \par \uc2 The issue for a project wishing to raise funds for its launch is that potentially a significant amount of its coins could be returned within two weeks of the token sale.\par \par \uc2 This could mean that stablecoin issuances might only be attractive to large institutions that already have a lot of capital and who don\u8217\'20\'19t need to raise funds in order to build.\par \par \uc2 Will the MiCA rules on stablecoins be too restrictive?\par \par \uc2 The EU appears to be concerned that stablecoins could threaten its control of the money supply, but it seems to be trying to balance this with the desire not to totally suppress the undoubted beneficial innovations that come with stablecoins.\par \par \uc2 Also, with the rule that interest cannot be paid to consumers on their stablecoin holdings, this takes away one of their utilities and could eventually lead to them putting their money into the bank instead, which is of course exactly what governments are after.\par \par \uc2 And finally, there is to be a $200 million euro cap on daily stablecoin transactions. At first glance this might seem a high limit, but in practice it isn\u8217\'20\'19t. Many of the stablecoins operating today exceed this amount many times over.\par \par \uc2 The good, the bad, the ugly, and the unknown\par \par \uc2 The good\par \par \uc2 It does appear that the EU is genuinely trying to strike a balance between providing a clearly regulated environment for crypto assets while at the same time attempting to still allow for innovation to happen.\par \par \uc2 Regulatory clarity would hopefully attract those risk-averse sectors such as finance to come and set up in the EU, therefore, helping the European economy to compete with the United States and Asia as a place in which to do business based on \uc2 DLT\uc2  and other innovative technologies.\par \par \uc2 The bad\par \par \uc2 Regulatory compliance is a good thing, but it may be seen that the cost involved here could be prohibitive. Just the legal costs of writing a whitepaper could be great. Lawyers would have to comb through every word given that it would need to be a legally binding document.\par \par \uc2 Also, while not just involving huge costs for a project, it also greatly increases the chances that it might be taken to court, with the ensuing costs of litigation to be added to the bill, and possible fines or worse to be faced.\par \par \uc2 With the 2-week redemption period there is the possibility that potential attacks on social media attempting to put would-be investors off, will mean that no project can consider its fund raise safe until the 2-week period has ended.\par \par \uc2 MiCA provides a loophole for the 2-week redemption period if a company is able to get its token listed on an exchange. However, this can have the effect of giving a lot more power back to the exchanges, which might do creative deals with projects that will allow them to list quickly.\par \par \uc2 The ugly\par \par \uc2 Two odd exemptions from the MiCA specified categories are those of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Although they are covered by MiCA, they don\u8217\'20\'19t fit into the EMT, ART, or utility categories, so they would likely have to fit into the catch-all \u8216\'20\'18cryptocurrencies\u8217\'20\'19 category.\par \par \uc2 The problem arises that bitcoin has no \u8216\'20\'18issuer\u8217\'20\'19, so a whitepaper can\u8217\'20\'19t be written by it. However, the 30 June agreement gets around this by obliging the exchanges that list it to write the whitepaper themselves.\par \par \uc2 After writing the whitepaper they would then have to go through the same process for any project wishing to be accepted, and they would also assume the same liability and risks for everything written in the whitepaper, even though they did not create the crypto asset itself.\par \par \uc2 According to the Dusk Network view, a \u8216\'20\'18grandfather\u8217\'20\'19 rule might be expected to be applied, whereby a whitepaper wouldn\u8217\'20\'19t be required of existing exchanges, but would be needed by any new exchanges, and also existing exchanges if they added these tokens after the rules came into effect.\par \par \uc2 Finally, an oversight by MiCA means that as the regulations come into effect and exchanges are required to obtain licences as CASPs, the current Anti-Money Laundering Directive 5 will still be in force, which requires fiat/crypto exchanges to have a licence for each EU state in which they operate.\par \par \uc2 Therefore, for the first 18 months after MiCA comes into force, crypto exchanges will need both national and EU licences which effectively doubles the amount of work for them.\par \par \uc2 The unknown\par \par \uc2 Even though the EU has been working on MiCA for 2 years, several key elements remain unaddressed. For example, although the rules for EMTs and ARTs are fairly well described, it does not appear that the utility token category contains enough specifics.\par \par \uc2 Issuers of utility tokens will still have to follow the same burdensome rules such as writing a whitepaper, but the possibility of additional rules for this category remains for the future.\par \par \uc2 On the subject of \uc2 sustainability\uc2  and energy usage, nothing concrete has been laid down, but this still leaves token issuers with a requirement to report their \uc2 sustainability\uc2  details without knowing if they will break any rules.\par \par \uc2 NFTs were not covered in the final draft of MiCA, and therefore it is not known if an amendment will be added or if entirely different regulations will cover them.\par \par \uc2 GDPR was also not covered in the final draft, therefore this is likely to be added as an amendment in the future. The issue regarding the publication of public addresses and the related metadata is one that Dusk Network is seeking to solve.\par \par \uc2 Algorithmic stablecoins is one further area that has not been comprehensively covered by MiCA. It does state that \u8216\'20\'18algorithmic\u8217\'20\'19 stablecoins are categorically not real stablecoins since they have no assets backing them.\par \par \uc2 But because of this, it would appear that they would fit into the \u8216\'20\'18cryptocurrencies\u8217\'20\'19 category and would require a whitepaper, but not a licence. They would also be able to be handled by CASPs and listed on exchanges. This would mean that an entire sub-category of stablecoins would not be under the same restrictions as other stablecoins which would seem to be very unreasonable and a source of frustration for projects working in this arena.\par \par \uc2 Final thoughts\par \par \uc2 MiCA looks to be quite restrictive and limiting for issuers and providers, adding to their work burdens and also to their risks of operating, which is likely to impact on the decentralised and revolutionary potential of the technology.\par \par \uc2 However, it could add the much needed regulatory clarity that will hopefully give the confidence to both innovators and consumers to enter and remain in the European crypto assets space.\par \par \uc2 If successful, other jurisdictions around the world could copy parts of the MiCA regulations, and therefore it could have an impact that goes far beyond European borders.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 Crypto mining firm Compute North has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a federal court.\par \par \uc2 The bitcoin mining hosting provider had been struggling to survive due to the decline in bitcoin pricing and rising power costs.\par \par \uc2 Compute North filed the petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 "After any administrative expenses are paid, no funds will be available for distribution to unsecured creditors," the company claimed in the filing.\par \par \uc2 Kristyan Mjolsnes, head of marketing and \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , stated that the company is seeking "the opportunity to stabilize its business and implement a comprehensive restructuring process."\par \par \uc2 "(It) will enable us to continue servicing our customers and partners and make the necessary investments to achieve our strategic objectives," Mjolsnes added.\par \par \uc2 Even though the company has revenue and capital, it has managed to go bankrupt.\par \par \uc2 According to the bankruptcy filing, Compute North claims to have between $100 million-$500 million both in estimated liabilities and estimated assets.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, the company raised $385 million in equity and debt funding to finance its new bitcoin mining data centres. $85 million in equity funding came from Mercuria, a global energy and commodities trading company, Generate Capital, an infrastructure investment firm, and other investors. While $300 million came from Generate Capital.\par \par \uc2 U.S.-based investment group Post Road Group had also invested $25 million in the company. According to The Block, Compute North in July planned to increase its capacity by 1.2 gigawatts over the next 12 months.\par \par \uc2 Compute North also had the top biggest bitcoin mining firms as clients, including \uc2 Marathon\uc2 , which recently started energization at a colocated 280-megawatt bitcoin mining facility in West Texas. The two companies also closed an additional 42-megawatts hosting deal in July.\par \par \uc2 "Based on the information available at this time, it is our understanding that this filing will not impact our current mining operations. We are in communication with the hosting provider and monitoring their progress as they work through this process," a \uc2 Marathon\uc2  spokesperson said.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220926ei9q0000f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw120\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1800\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Comparing Axie Infinity and Cardano to Big Eyes Coin Next-Gen DeFi Services\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 771 \uc2 words\par \uc2 25 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Crypto projects like Axie Infinity are known as Game-Fi platforms because they reward members for participating and being active within their ecosystem. The Cardano project also aims to become a fully decentralized platform with proof-of-stake functionality.\par \par \uc2 In contrast to these two DeFi platforms, Big Eyes Coin enters the crypto space with new goals and a desire to trump pre-existing projects. Big Eyes is not a quick money scheme; instead, it intends to be a long-term project, setting new records in the crypto space.\par \par \uc2 Big Eyes: Merging A Utility Token with Its Eco-friendly Goals\par \par \uc2 Big Eyes is a crypto project with unique goals and characteristics. The Big Eyes crypto project has features to set it apart from other meme projects. Its developers carefully studied the crypto space before designing their project.\par \par \uc2 While Big Eyes remains a meme-inspired crypto project, it is not a "Make money and exit" platform. While Big Eyes intends to make money, it will redistribute these proceeds back to its community members. Thus, it will have the support of its loyal crypto community, keeping it afloat alongside thousands of crypto projects with a short life span.\par \par \uc2 In addition to improving the financial status of its members, the Big Eyes project is keen on implementing further change in the human community. Big Eyes has devoted part of its resources to charitable organizations.\par \par \uc2 It aims to bring about change in the environment by educating people and moving them to action to prevent ocean and \uc2 environmental\uc2  degradation. As a cat-themed crypto project, it intends to do this to have a lifetime supply of fish as food.\par \par \uc2 Thus, Big Eyes cares about its members all over the globe. Its support behind these movements to solve \uc2 environmental\uc2  problems will help improve its members' quality of life. This support will also publicize its benefits to the world, attracting more people to its platform.\par \par \uc2 The Big Eyes Crypto Project Compared with Axie Infinity and Cardano\par \par \uc2 Axie Infinity is a virtual gaming platform. Operating on blockchain technology, it allows its users to profit from trading non-fungible tokens. The Axie Infinity Game-Fi platform involves players engaging in battle to determine who has the strongest army.\par \par \uc2 Each player can build an army of Axies. These are NFT-like digital assets that look like monsters. Each Axie is unique and has unique metadata securely stored on blockchain technology.\par \par \uc2 These Axie can be cared for in the Axie Infinity virtual land. They can be grown and mated to create new Axies. However, these Axies' unique features depend on their parent's characteristics.\par \par \uc2 The Cardano crypto project is a blockchain designed to rival the Ethereum network. It operates as a proof-of-stake protocol, utilizing Ouroboros, a new type of proof-of-stake protocol.\par \par \uc2 Cardano operates as a multilayered blockchain to make its network fast and cheap. It separates its computational and accounting layers, preventing congestion within its ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 Axie Infinity and Cardano have their primary cryptocurrency for their platforms.\par \par \uc2 Axie Infinity has two digital assets, Axie Shards (AXS) and Smooth Love Portion (SLP), that serve as reward tokens. The AXS token also serves as a governance token within the Axie Infinity ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 ADA tokens are governance tokens within the Cardano ecosystem. It gives all holders voting rights to determine the future of the Cardano project. Holders can also stake ADA tokens for rewards.\par \par \uc2 Buy The Big Eyes Presale Today\par \par \uc2 Unlike ADA and Axie Infinity tokens, Big Eyes Coin is yet to be fully released. In the coming months, it will become available on the Uniswap platform. This DEX will make it easy for the Big Eyes tokens to gain popularity and be easily purchased.\par \par \uc2 If you are interested in becoming part of Big Eyes, follow these steps to buy the presale.\par \par \uc2 * Install and fund your Metamask wallet with USDT, ETH, and BNB.\par \par \uc2 * Visit the Big Eyes website presale section via {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://buy.bigeyes.space"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://buy.bigeyes.space}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 * Connect your wallet and select your cryptocurrency deposit.\par \par \uc2 * Approve the transaction to finalize the purchase.\par \par \uc2 Conclusion\par \par \uc2 Big Eyes Coin has the potential to become the most significant crypto token ever created. Its edge-cutting features will prove to be richly rewarding. Buy the presale to enjoy its benefits.\par \par \uc2 Big Eyes Coin (BIG)\par \par \uc2 Presale: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://buy.bigeyes.space/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://buy.bigeyes.space/}}}\par \par \uc2 Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bigeyes.space/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://bigeyes.space/}}}\par \par \uc2 Telegram: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.me/BIGEYESOFFICIAL}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

This is no surprise as the tens of billions raised over the past several years had to go somewhere, and it definitely did not go to building new innovative technology.\par \par \uc2 One area that bitcoin has fallen short in the public relations department, and the focus of this piece, is in the framing of how blocks are validated, colloquially called proof-of-work (PoW) or mining.\par \par \uc2 Firstly, How Does Mining Work?\par \par \uc2 In a nutshell bitcoin miners use PoW, which uses energy, to find a needle in a haystack. When they find the needle, they use it to create and add a new block to Bitcoin's blockchain. When this new block is added, the miner gets rewarded with newly minted bitcoin. To date, this is the most decentralized means to achieving network consensus and creating valid blocks. More on bitcoin mining {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bitcoinmining.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 here}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin Mining And The Framing Effect\par \par \uc2 In a world where capital is directed by criteria like \uc2 environmental\uc2 , social and governance (ESG) scores, green narratives in adoption of new technology are becoming increasingly important.\par \par \uc2 Knowing this, the perceived high energy costs of bitcoin mining and the term mining itself, which is associated with \uc2 environmental\uc2  destruction, has become a barrier to bitcoins adoption and a red herring used by DINO projects to discredit bitcoin and pump their bags.\par \par \uc2 Relatively speaking though, bitcoin mining's energy usage is quite small and is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://squareup.com/au/en/press/bcei-white-paper?country_redirection=true"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 mostly green}}}\uc2 . The reason people look past these realities is due to a cognitive bias known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.simplypsychology.org/framing-effect.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 framing effect}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 "The framing effect is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations."\par \par \uc2 The term mining comes with many negative connotations (see image below). With other digital assets available that promise similar solutions to bitcoin with a much smaller \uc2 environmental\uc2  footprint, na\u239\'00\'EFve users in many cases will choose them over bitcoin due to the framing effect.\par \par \uc2 People think of this when they hear mining.\par \par \uc2 I won't get into the details in this piece, but the "greener" solution proof-of-stake (PoS) is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.lynalden.com/proof-of-stake/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 not a viable alternative}}}\uc2  and will inevitably lead to centralization. Though with the complexities underpinning both PoW and PoS, it's no surprise that people make choices due to superficial reasons, such as na\u239\'00\'EFve views on energy.\par \par \uc2 A psychological theory that underpins the framing effect is known as the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.simplypsychology.org/prospect-theory.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 prospect theory}}}\uc2  explains why:\par \par \uc2 "The prospect theory holds that individuals are more influenced by the possibility of a loss than the prospect of an equivalent gain."\par \par \uc2 Most people don't understand that the gain of PoW (More energy use, but decentralized) is greater than the loss of PoS (Less energy use, but centralized). Although it's easy to understand the loss from a purely \uc2 environmental\uc2  perspective.\par \par \uc2 This is exacerbated by the fact that the majority of people today {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2020/how-people-access-news-about-climate-change/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 see climate change being a serious}}}\uc2  societal problem and sensationalist pieces such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html%5C"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 "Bitcoin Uses More Electricity Than Many Countries. How Is That Possible?"}}}\uc2  circulate regularly. This is how the framing effect manifests as individuals are only shown the context of one of the frames (the \uc2 environmental\uc2  one).\par \par \uc2 So, what can we do to overcome the framing effect and have people realize bitcoin mining isn't going to boil the oceans and is actually a good use of energy? We could take a note out of DINO handbook and leverage narratives that have less negative connotations associated with them to our benefit.\par \par \uc2 How could this be applied to bitcoin mining? Well ...\par \par \uc2 Let's Call Bitcoin Miners, Bitcoin Validators\par \par \uc2 With the Ethereum 2.0 merge, Ethereum has moved from mining with PoW, to using validators with PoS. Mining and miners as we know them will no longer exist on Ethereum, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/05/18/country-power-no-more"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 claims of up to 99.5%}}}\uc2  reduction in energy usage have been cited.\par \par \uc2 These energy savings are a red herring as it comes at the cost of decentralization. Decentralization is a fundamental first principle of cryptocurrencies, without it they are useless. A centralized public cryptocurrency's energy usage, even if tiny, is 100% wasted as the network has failed. Bitcoiners know this, and it's why they will never {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/news/change-the-code-not-the-climate-greenpeace-usa-ewg-others-launch-campaign-to-push-bitcoin-to-reduce-climate-pollution/#:~:text=A%20campaign%20to%20push%20Bitcoin,mining%20facilities%20in%20their%20communities."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 change the code}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 So, back to the framing effect. The term validators has much more positive connotations towards it due to DINOs marketing efforts, and it's not as loaded of a term as mining. Less negative connotations means people will perceive the term more positively. Avoiding the framing effect by using a more media friendly term like validator will make it easier for people to understand the gain of PoW (More energy use, but decentralized) is greater than the loss of PoS (Less energy use, but centralized).\par \par \uc2 DINO has done all the work here by shifting the narrative to being PoS > PoW. The least we can do is leverage this effort for our benefit as they have done time and time again using the bitcoins brand to justify their Rube Goldberg machine.\par \par \uc2 So, calling bitcoin miners, bitcoin validators can prevent the framing effect from occurring and shift the narrative towards PoS < PoW. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum using the same term also makes discussions contrasting the two less nuanced making it easier for people to grasp. It's also more of a technically correct and explicit term as producing valid blocks is what miners (validators) do.\par \par \uc2 Below are the mining related terms we should change:\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin mining pools = Bitcoin validator pools\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin miners = Bitcoin validators\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin mining = Bitcoin validating\par \par \uc2 Summary\par \par \uc2 In summary, re-framing PoW mining to PoW validating will benefit bitcoin long term by preventing the framing effect from occurring which is a cognitive bias where people decide on options based on whether the options are presented with positive or negative connotations.\par \par \uc2 Mining = negative connotations.\par \par \uc2 Validating = positive connotations (thanks Ethereum).\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Doc Sharp.

Some Ethereum loyalists aren\u8217\'20\'19t so sure\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWhat do you think of the merge?\u8221\'20\'1D I recently innocently asked William \u8220\'20\'1CWills\u8221\'20\'1D de Vogelaere, co-founder of Spankchain and probably half a dozen other protocols in the grisly underworld of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/?post_type=post&p=5726"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 I was, of course, referring to the long-awaited software upgrade which booted Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/?post_type=post&p=5743"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 miners}}}\uc2  and replaced them with a cohort of environmentally friendly stakeholders on September 15.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou mean Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s delusion?\u8221\'20\'1D de Vogelaere rejoined bitterly.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COho!\u8221\'20\'1D I thought. This could get juicy. It turned out de Vogelaere was voicing an opinion rarely broadcast in public: that the merge was a mistake. Or, if not an italicized mistake, some kind of irrelevant distraction.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CIt didn\u8217\'20\'19t add anything of value really other than the \uc2 environmental\uc2  factor,\u8221\'20\'1D he fulminated.\par \par \uc2 In de Vogelaere\u8217\'20\'19s view, the whole enterprise has been a naive capitulation. The influential people fretting about Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s enormous carbon footprint, he said, were only ever exploiting environmentalist fears for their own cynical ends. \u8220\'20\'1CNo one actually gives a shit if something\u8217\'20\'19s green, so long as it works,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CCorporations don\u8217\'20\'19t fucking care as long as they can be perceived to care.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Maronn\u8217\'20\'19! Admittedly, it\u8217\'20\'19s not hard to see why people like de Vogelaere are in a bad mood\u8212\'20\'14since the merge unfolded, the price of ETH has tanked. Bitcoin supporters are ridiculing the change. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/110107/sec-ethereum-us-jurisdiction"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Dark mutterings}}}\uc2  about Ethereum now being a \u8220\'20\'1Csecurity\u8221\'20\'1D have raised the hackles of even the most old-school of Ethereum connoisseurs\u8212\'20\'14and even driven some to the embrace of a long-ago spurned band of fanatical Ethereum militants. (We\u8217\'20\'19ll get to that.)\par \par \uc2 As de Vogalaere told me, the notion that public opinion of Ethereum would improve in the wake of the merge may have proven to be a canard. The regulators, he said, will hardly change their tune now this one \uc2 environmental\uc2  grievance has been eliminated, especially given that newfound willingness to brand it a security.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://content.jwplatform.com/players/DPlyaHuH.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click on the link.}}}\par \par \uc2 And yes, yes, the merge was a fabulous display of technical competence. Merging Ethereum in real-time was the equivalent of switching up a car\u8217\'20\'19s engine as it booms full-throttle down a freeway, so we\u8217\'20\'19re told. It\u8217\'20\'19s groundbreaking from an R&D perspective\u8212\'20\'14but so was the atom bomb.\par \par \uc2 Even so, de Vogelaere believes, the supposed technical improvements of the merge are overhyped. It was supposed to facilitate various upgrades that would introduce more efficiencies into the network. But de Vogelaere believes these solutions have long existed anyway, in the form of sidechains\u8212\'20\'14appendages to the flagship network that use different validation methods\u8212\'20\'14such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-polygon-matic-and-why-it-matters-for-ethereum"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Polygon}}}\uc2 . Only Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s computing environment, the \u8220\'20\'1CVirtual Machine,\u8221\'20\'1D has any real value, he argued\u8212\'20\'14and that isn\u8217\'20\'19t affected in any meaningful way by the shift to the staking model.\par \par \uc2 He also (good heavens!) pointed out that those who don\u8217\'20\'19t have the minimum amount to stake independently\u8212\'20\'1432 ETH, around $42,500 dollars and dropping at time of writing\u8212\'20\'14have to stake via centralized exchanges like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 . That means putting the majority of Ethereum on a corporate exchange with a single point of failure.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/109766/the-ethereum-merge-is-here-what-next/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Ethereum Merge Is Here\u8212\'20\'14What Comes Next?}}}\par \par \uc2 So, we\u8217\'20\'19ve established that Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s price is now in the shitter and the regulators are on the move. But is de Vogelaere\u8217\'20\'19s view perhaps just a minority one?\par \par \uc2 Not so! Kristy Leigh-Minehan, a longtime Ethereum miner (who may admittedly be a little bit biased), is not quite anti-merge in the same rancorous vein as our de Vogelaere. Rather, she wonders whether it came about a bit too soon. \u8220\'20\'1CThe move to proof of stake is a key part of Ethereum's DNA and was always intended,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. \u8220\'20\'1CIt was necessary and required for future optimizations and scalability features\u8212\'20\'14the question everyone needs to ask themselves is: was now the right time?\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Minehan isn\u8217\'20\'19t so sure. \u8220\'20\'1CI, personally, do not think it was in the current regulatory climate,\u8221\'20\'1D she said. She wonders whether the prospect of ETH being newly classed as a security could risk \u8220\'20\'1Cscaring validators, operators, and entrepreneurs.\u8221\'20\'1D The primacy of American regulators in particular, she added, can be unnerving. Echoing de Vogelaere, she said: \u8220\'20\'1CThere is no denying Ethereum has taken root in the USA\u8211\'20\'13that will be its biggest strength and weakness.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 At least some pedigreed Ethereum advocates remain sanguine. \u8220\'20\'1CIt could be the case that this has some impact on regulatory decision making,\u8221\'20\'1D ventured Mat Dryhurst, a left-leaning podcaster and one of the earliest adopters of NFTs. \u8220\'20\'1CBut to be honest, I don't get much of an impression that is too much of a concern on the dev side. People are excited to build more utility for the network, and the merge felt like a celebration of another milestone on a long roadmap.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 But isn\u8217\'20\'19t it admittedly a bit overhyped? \u8220\'20\'1CIt is not a grand technological innovation, and I don't think it was intended to be,\u8221\'20\'1D Dryhurst demurred. \u8220\'20\'1CRollups, zkEVMs [zero-knowledge virtual machines] etc are still needed to scale. I think if anything it just establishes credibility for this corner of crypto, and increases confidence that other ideas being discussed will be executed upon.\u8221\'20\'1D He added that he was recently at ETH Berlin and that the energy was \u8220\'20\'1Cas optimistic as ever.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The gleeful old guard\par \par \uc2 There is, maybe, one cohort that fully agrees with all de Vogelaere and his ilk\u8217\'20\'19s dire diagnoses of the merge\u8212\'20\'14and is unabashedly jubilant about them. They are the custodians of another now-defunct network that, they would argue, was, like the miners, also betrayed by the craven handlers of Ethereum proper: an older, abandoned iteration of Ethereum network called Ethereum Classic whose supporters are arguably the most OG that you can get in the brief but melodramatic lifespan of Ethereum politics.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum Classic was born in 2016 in the wake of a deleterious hack of the Ethereum network\u8217\'20\'19s first decentralized autonomous organization, or The DAO. Mainstream Ethereum developers voted overwhelmingly to \u8220\'20\'1Croll back\u8221\'20\'1D the hack and make victims' whole, which a few sticklers viewed as a deadly betrayal of Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s core principle of immutability. They clung to the old, hacked network, and Ethereum was cleft in two. They have been waiting ever since for the merge, believing that newly unemployed miners (whom they actively tried to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/10290/ethereum-classics-plan-to-seduce-ethereums-miners?amp=1"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 seduce}}}\uc2 ) would flock to Ethereum Classic in search of new revenue.\par \par \uc2 Incredibly, after six years of patient anticipation, they were right.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/109724/what-ethereum-merge-means-and-doesnt-users/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 What the Ethereum Merge Means for Ordinary Users\u8212\'20\'14And What It Doesn\u8217\'20\'19t}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve seen significantly increased interest in Ethereum Classic in the last couple of months,\u8221\'20\'1D said Bob Summerwill, the executive director of the ETC Cooperative, the foundation behind the development of Ethereum Classic, whose ticker is ETC. \u8220\'20\'1CThe merge was obviously a catalyst.\u8221\'20\'1D He added that the amount of mining power on the network has since increased around tenfold, and that Ethereum Classic is now the third largest proof-of-work chain by market cap and second by volume.\par \par \uc2 Summerwill, as with others, pointed out that fears around U.S.-capture of the network and newly vigorous regulators may have galvanized many of these miners and driven them to ETC. \u8220\'20\'1CEthereum Classic seems to be benefitting from providing a known and likely safer alternative on these concerns,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. It has nevertheless been a bumpy start: Ethereum Classic, as with many others, took a recent dip, and its miners are operating at a loss. \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re still trying to find a new equilibrium,\u8221\'20\'1D Summerwill said.\par \par \uc2 Still, it\u8217\'20\'19s a somewhat stunning reversal. After years of agonizing waiting, you have to wonder whether the curmudgeonly old pedants of the Ethereum Classic network\u8212\'20\'14and, even, Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s would-be regulators\u8212\'20\'14have got the last laugh.\par \par \uc2 As de Vogelaere said: \u8220\'20\'1CETH may have played its motherfucking self.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Zero-Knowledge-Lighter-4-2.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 View image.}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cdn.decrypt.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/ethereum-merge-crypto-gID_2.jpeg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 View image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Document CRYP000020221005ei9n0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal600

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2  (\uc2 WEF\uc2 ) has established a Crypto \uc2 Sustainability\uc2  Coalition to investigate the capability of Web3 in tackling \uc2 climate change\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.weforum.org/press/2022/09/new-crypto-sustainability-coalition-to-investigate-potential-of-web3-technologies-in-fighting-climate-change"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 statement}}}\uc2 , the \uc2 WEF\uc2  noted that blockchain tools would propel transparency in the worldwide carbon credits market, whereas crypto mining would trigger renewable microgrids through off-peak demand and decentralization.\par \par \uc2 Since the adoption of technologies like non-fungible tokens (NFTs), blockchains, and cryptocurrencies in Web 3.0, members of the coalition will find out how they can boost social and \uc2 environmental\uc2  agendas.\par \par \uc2 The coalition also seeks regulatory clarity that enhances Web3 innovation, propels financial inclusion, and protects consumers.\par \par \uc2 Brynly Llyr, \uc2 World Economic Forum\uc2 's head of blockchain and digital assets, noted:\par \par \uc2 I am excited about the work we are expecting from the Crypto \uc2 Sustainability\uc2  Coalition. An important and unique aspect of web3 is that it uses technology to support and reward direct community engagement and action.\par \par \uc2 Llyr added:\par \par \uc2 This means we can coordinate the work of many individuals directly with one another, enabling collective action without centralized control a powerful accelerator for grass roots action.\par \par \uc2 The Crypto \uc2 Sustainability\uc2  Coalition consist of 30 partners hosted by the \uc2 WEF\uc2  as a public-private initiative. Its primary areas of concern include Web3's potential for climate action, energy usage, and on-chain carbon credits.\par \par \uc2 Some partners include Solana, Circle, NEAR Foundation, PlanetWatch, University of Lisbon, eToro, Crypto Council for Innovation, and Sustainable Bitcoin Standard.\par \par \uc2 Moreover, the coalition will come up with best practices and tangible action on how Web3 technologies can positively impact communities most affected by \uc2 climate change\uc2 . The report noted:\par \par \uc2 The coalition's wider aim is to foster a broad education campaign on what Web3's potential and capacity look like, to better inform governments on how they regulate these technologies and incentivize investment and research into their development.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, a report by Chainlink Labs and Tecnalia noted that blockchain technology could help fight the climate crisis through smart contracts, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/blockchain-can-improve-climate-crisis-through-smart-contracts-study-shows"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Blockchain.News}}}\uc2  reported.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220923ei9n0000a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw120\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1800\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Top Five Blockchain Projects To Focus On In 2023\b0\par\par\uc2 CryptoDaily \par \uc2 1,349 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 The year so far has been nothing but brutal to the crypto market. Despite continuous development and innovation in the blockchain space, coins have dropped magnificently with the total market capitalization of the crypto market, which stood at $3 trillion in November last year, now less than $1 trillion - representing over a 68% drop in less than a year. The decentralized finance (DeFi) market has witnessed a tougher drop from $97 billion at its peak to $26.26 billion, as of writing. And the once-raging non-fungible tokens (NFT) space needs no explanation - it is technically dead - with NFTs that cost millions of dollars trading over 90% less in value.\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, if you have been in the crypto market long enough, you must be convinced that the current bear market is just a phase and the market will bounce back quicker than most experts expect. However, as the crypto tides rise, not all projects will rise with it, most of the \u8220\'20\'1Cuseless\u8221\'20\'1D projects drowning with no chance of recovery - even when the bull market returns.\par \par \uc2 In this piece, we focus on some of the projects that could be on their way to recovery despite the grime market conditions. We focus on the resistance these projects are showing during the bear market (despite dropping from all-time high values), the developmental promise they offer, their growing communities, the long-term value they will offer, and most importantly, their innovation in the blockchain space.\par \par \uc2 Here are five of the top projects you should set your bets on as you await the end of this treacherous bear market.\par \par \uc2 * Ethereum: A new look proof-of-stake blockchain\par \par \uc2 Nothing has captivated the crypto and blockchain community quite like Ethereum merge since the Luna/Terra collapse this year. On September 15th, the second largest blockchain successfully completed its transition to proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, the merge, officially deprecating proof-of-work and reducing energy consumption by approximately 99.95%. This is expected to reduce the total world energy consumption by about 0.05%.\par \par \uc2 While the energy consumption is a great deal to conserving the environment, the thing that places Ethereum on our list is the burn rate that is expected to remove over 1.5 million ETH from the ecosystem every year. This offers a great opportunity for Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s value growth, with the supply decreasing every year. Could we see Ethereum finally overtake Bitcoin as the number one cryptocurrency?\par \par \uc2 * T3rn - Full reversion of all blockchain executions\par \par \uc2 If you have ever sent crypto or NFT to the wrong address or the wrong amount, you know it is impossible to recover the funds. This has been a contentious issue across the blockchain community, with proponents of the irreversibility stating it helps to keep the blockchain secure and prevents any interference from third parties, whether centralized exchanges, governments, or banks. On the flip side, opponents argue that for crypto to become a global monetary currency, reversibility of transactions should be implemented, as human mistakes, hacking and theft will remain prevalent despite crypto being implemented.\par \par \uc2 One project, t3rn aims to make this a possibility while maintaining the security properties of blockchains. t3rn is a smart contract hosting platform that offers an innovative solution to interoperable smart contract execution with fail-safe mechanisms built in, that allows only successful transactions to be executed. The t3rn protocol focuses specifically on the fail-safe aspect of cross-chain execution, where an execution finishes in all of the connected blockchains or rolls back all of the trice (side effects).\par \par \uc2 This improves the blockchain ecosystem as a whole, as any mistake (address or amount of funds) can be rectified before it's finalized while maintaining the security of the blockchains connected. As more people adopt the newest innovation in the blockchain space, the adoption rates of crypto will easily go up. It is truly a game-changer in the crypto and blockchain space.\par \par \uc2 * Rootstock (RSK) - Bitcoin-based smart contracts\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s almost impossible to look at the future of crypto without including the largest blockchain, Bitcoin, in the conversation. Our third project selection for a futuristic future in the blockchain space is Rootstock (\uc2 RSK\uc2 ), a project offering users decentralized finance (DeFi) built on Bitcoin. While Bitcoin was specifically created with high restrictions when executing smart contracts in a bid to make it very secure and robust, the launch of blockchains such as Ethereum challenged the developers to create a better platform that could execute advanced smart contracts on Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Hence the launch of Rootstock.\par \par \uc2 Since its launch, the platform has welcomed a number of projects into the fray. Recently, the \uc2 RSK\uc2  client WakeUp Labs entered into a long-term strategic collaboration with Kilimo (Swahili for \u8216\'20\'18agriculture\u8217\'20\'19), a "climate tech" start-up that verifies the water consumption of agriculture businesses. In partnership with WakeUp Labs, an \uc2 environmental\uc2  conservation protocol built on \uc2 RSK\uc2 , and Kilimo will issue tokenized certificates, or verification NFTs, to entrepreneurs and farmers who create and use responsible water conservation techniques.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, Rootstock also hosts the BitGive Foundation, one of the leading blockchain protocols for making charitable donations. Finally, 88i, an insurance platform, is also built on \uc2 RSK\uc2  technology offering clients care services in their insurance in a timely and relevant manner. The platform offers different customers connected with insurance brokers a fast, transparent and easy way to pay their insurance.\par \par \uc2 * Looking Glass - Prime Non-fungible token (\u8220\'20\'1CNFT\u8221\'20\'1D) architecture\par \par \uc2 As the NFT craze reached a fever pitch in 2021, several developers noticed two major obstacles that were hindering the widespread adoption of this latest blockchain-based innovation. The first obstacle was the overall complexity of the creation and purchase experiences, the second obstacle was the lack of applications/blockchains or wallets in which NFTs can be used. With much fanfare still held in these assets, despite the crash in prices during the course of 2022, new NFT platforms are offering investors solutions to these obstacles in a bid to take NFTs back to their all-time high values.\par \par \uc2 Such a project is \uc2 Looking Glass Labs\uc2  (\uc2 LGL\uc2 ), a Web3 platform specializing in the non-fungible token (\u8220\'20\'1CNFT\u8221\'20\'1D) architecture, immersive metaverse environments, play-to-earn tokenization and virtual asset royalty streams. While current NFT games offer 2D images and lower quality images, \uc2 LGL\uc2  allows users to curate next-generation 3D metaverses, allowing functional art and collectibles to exist simultaneously across different NFT blockchain environments.\par \par \uc2 * Bridge Champ - Bridge online gameplays\par \par \uc2 Despite blockchain games facing criticism in the recent past, it remains one of the quickest and surest ways for blockchain to reach global adoption. According to a Citi Group report, the metaverse and blockchain gaming space will become a $30 billion market by 2030, with VC companies spending over $4.5 billion on the metaverse so far in 2022. \uc2 Facebook\uc2  (now \uc2 Meta\uc2 ) has already spent over $12 billion on their metaverse project so far.\par \par \uc2 The potential for growth is immense.\par \par \uc2 Jelurida, a blockchain software company that develops and maintains the Nxt and Ardor blockchains, is aiming to capture this market with its investment in Bridge Champ, an online platform that combines bridge gameplay with tournaments and a growing social context to connect millions of players globally. The company makes it easier than ever to design, build and implement custom decentralized applications on public platforms or as private, permissioned or hybrid solutions. As traditional games move to the blockchain, contact bridges such as Bridge Champ will be important to bring more gamers into the space.\par \par \uc2 Conclusion\par \par \uc2 As we end the year, crypto markets look very unlikely to recover their 2021 bullish run. As investors, looking for the right project with a long term value proposition could be the key to big gains if the market recovers in future. The list above is in no way exhaustive but give a pretty good picture of which projects could shape the upcoming bullish run, if any happens in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Brave New Coin Limited \par \par \uc2 As part of a drive to strengthen its contribution to the Nigerian economy, the Lekki Free Zone Development Company is in talks with blockchain technology company Gluwa.\par \par \uc2 The organizations are looking to partner and use blockchain to foster trade collaboration, growth, and \uc2 sustainability\uc2  among new and existing Free Zone enterprises. The partnership would also explore the creation of a Virtual Free Zone within the Lekki Free Zone (LFZ).\par \par \uc2 Lekki Free Zone\u8217\'20\'19s Head of Strategy, Innovation & Special Projects, Mr. Tomiwa Idowu, has disclosed that discussions are ongoing between LZF, the Nigerian Export Processing Zones Authority, and the Gluwa team.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, Idowu explained that the partnership, when finalized, will create a dashboard for the tokenization of goods into NFTs (non-fungible tokens) and provide digital asset-backed loans for new and existing enterprises who are looking to fund operations and/or expand their businesses, similar to the integration of OpenSea and Compound.\par \par \uc2 Idowu shared his vision for innovating the trading and industrial sector in Nigeria and Africa as a whole, bringing it into the modern information age with the Lekki Free Zone at the epicenter.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI am extremely excited by the enormous potential of such a partnership, which would further establish Lagos State as Africa\u8217\'20\'19s leading sub-national in terms of innovation, economic development and revenue generation,\u8221\'20\'1D said Idowu.\par \par \uc2 He commended the Lagos State Governor, \uc2 Babajide Sanwo-Olu\uc2 , as a beacon of progress and hope for the nation in general, saying: \u8220\'20\'1COur Governor has always been a firm believer in fast-paced development, which involves using technology to leapfrog bureaucracy and going straight to solving immediate problems.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Chief Executive Officer at Gluwa, Tae Oh, noted that the firm is keen to partner with the Lekki Free Zone as it is the largest and most developed Free Zone in Nigeria with proximity to the deep-sea port as well as the Dangote refinery, saying: \u8220\'20\'1CTrading has been the bedrock of the Nigerian economy, with annual volumes running into billions of dollars.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He added: \u8220\'20\'1CWe believe the digitization of the sector can allow us to harness its full potential. For instance, a standard process to digitize goods manufactured or processed within the zone in tandem with a market system on web3 will allow manufacturers to trade globally via the blockchain.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll trades will be registered and benefit from the incentives of the Lekki Free Zone, such as zero taxation and free circulation of goods. As soon as the goods get settled for export by the in-Zone Customs Processing Center, they will get shipped out straight from the Lekki Free Zone via the deep-sea port.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis will reduce delays, eliminate human errors, exponentially drive up Nigeria\u8217\'20\'19s non-oil exports and sustain a positive trade balance for the nation. While we are still working out the fine details and a specific framework with NEPZA, we believe it is the future of commerce and trade in Africa.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 About Gluwa\par \par \uc2 Gluwa is an Open Finance platform, connecting capital from developed markets to emerging market lending opportunities using blockchain technology. By providing the decentralized infrastructure rails to raise and disburse capital anywhere in the world, investors can use the Gluwa Invest platform to partake in debt-financing deals with emerging market fintech lenders, earning up to 15% APY.\par \par \uc2 Contacts\par \par \uc2 VP of Business\par \par \uc2 * Aston Lee\par \par \uc2 * Gluwa\par \par \uc2 * support@gluwa.com\par \par \uc2 Document BRACOI0020220922ei9m00002\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw120\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal1800\pichgoal600

NFT collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Apes have helped make digital collectibles mainstream\u8212\'20\'14and, according to \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 , the NFT boom has been particularly impactful in broadening crypto adoption in Central and Southern Asia.\par \par \uc2 The analytics firm noted that another 21% of traffic to crypto services was related to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-are-play-to-earn-games-how-players-are-making-a-living-with-nfts"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 play-to-earn}}}\uc2  blockchain games, which reward players with cryptocurrencies and often integrate NFTs into their gameplay. \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2  suspects that the correlation is likely no coincidence.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://wp.decrypt.co/109623/ethereum-merge-ends-environmental-debate-nfts/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 How the Ethereum Merge Ends the Environmental Debate About NFTs}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CFor countries with high web traffic to NFT marketplaces\u8212\'20\'14especially Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines\u8212\'20\'14a large portion of that NFT-related traffic may therefore come from players of blockchain games,\u8221\'20\'1D the report said.\par \par \uc2 Blockchain games like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-axie-infinity-the-play-to-earn-nft-game-taking-crypto-by-storm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Axie Infinity}}}\uc2  have been particularly popular in the Philippines, though these games have seen a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://decrypt.co/104888/axie-infinity-nft-sales-rising-play-and-earn-transition"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 considerable drop in users}}}\uc2  in recent months as crypto prices have collapsed.

\par\par \b \uc2 Visit The Guatemalan Lake Town Mining Bitcoin With Used Cooking Oil\b0\par\par\uc2 1,020 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 September 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 A circular bitcoin economy in Guatemala is using resources that would otherwise be wasted to fuel a local bitcoin mining operation, giving its resident financial autonomy and demonstrating a viable economic path outside of the government-controlled economy.\par \par \uc2 Patrick Melder, MD, founder of the circular economy coined \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/LakeBitcoin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bitcoin Lake}}}\uc2 ,\u8221\'20\'1D told Bitcoin Magazine that its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/LakeBitcoin/status/1569316198692831232?s=20&t=zOGIwL6MW5-Q1NURFcuHGQ"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CKaboom\u8221\'20\'1D bitcoin mining project}}}\uc2  is the result of a desire to help clean nearby Lake Atitl\u225\'00\'E1n while providing a source of continuous income to the community.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe don\u8217\'20\'19t have any major endowment or donations to do what we are doing,\u8221\'20\'1D he said, underscoring a stark difference with El Salvador\u8217\'20\'19s Bitcoin Beach, which was established in part {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/on-the-coast-of-el-salvador-bitcoin-is-becoming-the-standard"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 thanks to a donation}}}\uc2 . \u8220\'20\'1CBitcoin mining was a way to get bitcoin flowing into the community.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Many attempts to clean the lake had been made before this project, most of which suffered from a flaw of trying to solve everything at once. According to Melder, an overhaul approach increases complexity and ends up reducing the likelihood of completion.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWithin the past five years, a major effort to clean the lake costing upwards of $300 million failed because it was so complex with so many large stakeholders who couldn\u8217\'20\'19t agree on a solution,\u8221\'20\'1D he added.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin Lake took a different approach by starting small with the repurposing of used cooking oil to power bitcoin mining ASICs.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThis cooking oil would either be thrown out into the street or find its way to the landfill which sits several hundred feet above Lake Atitl\u225\'00\'E1n,\u8221\'20\'1D Melder explained. \u8220\'20\'1CEither way, it would find its way into the watershed and into the lake.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 By kickstarting this initiative, Melder said he expects to trigger a snowball effect in neighboring communities as they realize cleaning the environment can not only be feasible but also profitable.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CAll community leaders and the citizens of the lake are concerned about the environment but there are limited tools and resources to tackle the problem. So our goal is to create a \u8216\'20\'18sliding scale\u8217\'20\'19 use of wasted/stranded energy to mine bitcoin and in the process clean the lake and create wealth in the communities. It\u8217\'20\'19s a sliding scale because in one small community, we may simply have a \u8216\'20\'18Kaboom-like\u8217\'20\'19 project or we may have small bio-digesters collecting waste.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Beyond Mining\par \par \uc2 Melder used to travel with his family to the city of Panajachel, Guatemala, every summer during his daughters\u8217\'20\'19 undergraduate school years, but after they graduated from college, those trips to the Central American country came to an end. However, Melder and his wife kept seeking ways to come back. It wasn\u8217\'20\'19t too long until he found out about Bitcoin Beach in El Salvador, which ultimately inspired him to travel once more to Panajachel and start Bitcoin Lake.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CMy desire was to bring the Bitcoin Beach model to Panajachel which is a beautiful town on Lake Atitl\u225\'00\'E1n in the Guatemalan highlands,\u8221\'20\'1D he wrote in a 2021 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://medium.com/coinmonks/bitcoin-lake-the-plan-a4d783113793"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 blog post}}}\uc2  that detailed his vision for the project.\par \par \uc2 In addition to cleaning up the lake, Melder detailed in that blog post the other goals that Bitcoin Lake would set out to achieve from the start, including helping a local education center and creating economic opportunities for the \u8220\'20\'1Csmall but vibrant Guatemalan town.\u8221\'20\'1D Since then, Bitcoin has been at the forefront of the project\u8217\'20\'19s work.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEverything we do in the community is related to bitcoin. It is either funded by bitcoin, teaches about bitcoin or is taught or implemented by bitcoiners,\u8221\'20\'1D Melder told Bitcoin Magazine. \u8220\'20\'1COur three goals in the community are to teach about bitcoin, create a bitcoin circular economy and clean the environment with bitcoin mining as the economic incentive.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 While Bitcoin Lake tackles the latter, the other two goals have not been sidelined. On the education front, the project has helped introduce Bitcoin-related coursework to the local education center Centro Educativo Josu\u233\'00\'E9.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe children there are taught about every aspect of Bitcoin, from \u8216\'20\'18what is money?,\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18what is inflation?,\u8217\'20\'19 \u8216\'20\'18why bitcoin was created,\u8217\'20\'19 to the basics of bitcoin mining, setting up a bitcoin full node, etc.,\u8221\'20\'1D Melder detailed. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are proud to say that we have been doing this since January of 2022 developing our own curriculum along the way and we\u8217\'20\'19ve had Bitcoiners from around the world come and help.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The work that began at the local school has since proliferated to a broader audience in the town, Melder said, in an attempt to help folks of all ages learn more about the world of peer-to-peer digital money.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19ve held bitcoin educational meetings for adults and business owners in the community and striven to include the indigenous community leaders as well,\u8221\'20\'1D he said.\par \par \uc2 With a better understanding of the technology, adoption is facilitated as users and business owners aren\u8217\'20\'19t caught off guard or coerced into using bitcoin. Rather, a movement begins, naturally.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CSince we\u8217\'20\'19ve started in January of this year, we\u8217\'20\'19ve onboarded over 60 businesses in and around Panajachel, and in Guatemala as a whole we have about 200 businesses that we have onboarded to accept bitcoin,\u8221\'20\'1D Melder explained.\par \par \uc2 As awareness about Bitcoin grows and adoption keeps increasing, the community is set to keep expanding its initiatives. On the mining front, Melder expects to further develop the repurposing of wasted and stranded resources to increase the community\u8217\'20\'19s steady income and improve the efficiency of the lake\u8217\'20\'19s clean-up even more.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur \uc2 environmental\uc2  cleanup/Bitcoin mining initiative just started, but will grow to the point in about a year that we can actually take unsorted landfill waste (new or old) and turn it into a clean energy source to mine bitcoin,\u8221\'20\'1D Melder forecasted. \u8220\'20\'1CWe are working with a group out of the U.K. to bring this to life and it will have a major impact in Panajachel and Guatemala as we now have an economic incentive to clean the massive waste issue that exists in Guatemala and in most developing countries. We are proud that we will be first to market with this technology.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Document BTCMAG0020220921ei9l000m9\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw264\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3960\pichgoal600

The new mini album is titled Clay Nation Tapes Vol. I and consists of three tracks: Manifest, ADA Dreams and Lil Flex\u8217\'20\'19n. In all three, Medici describes his crypto experience with bravado and enthusiasm. Judging by the album\u8217\'20\'19s title, it will not be the last musical collaboration between Champ Medici and Clay Nation. However, the release date of the album\u8217\'20\'19s second part is yet unknown.\par \par \uc2 Ripple\uc2  shovels 50 million XRP to anon wallet, here's what it means for market\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/ripple-shovels-50-million-xrp-to-anon-wallet-heres-what-it-means-for-market"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Yesterday}}}\uc2 , WhaleStats, a crypto transactions tracker, detected a total of nearly 582 million XRP on the move. Among these astonishing amounts of \uc2 Ripple\uc2 -affiliated token was a 50 million XRP transaction to an anonymous wallet conducted by \uc2 Ripple\uc2 . However, according to another tracker, Bithomp, this massive chunk of XRP was sent to \uc2 Ripple\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s own alternative address, RL18-VN. The address is used for sending XRP beyond the fintech giant \u8212\'20\'14 to institutional customers and exchanges, to sell or support the coin's liquidity, and to custodial wallets such as \uc2 BitGo\uc2 . This means that \uc2 Ripple\uc2  is preparing to inject another 50 million XRP into circulation as the token\u8217\'20\'19s price is increasing. XRP is currently trading at $0.4061, per CoinMarketCap.\par \par \uc2 Congressional candidate says Cardano is efficient blockchain\par \par \uc2 In a recent tweet, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/congressional-candidate-says-cardano-is-efficient-blockchain"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 January Walker}}}\uc2 , a congressional candidate and representative of the United Utah Party, called Cardano an \u8220\'20\'1Cefficient\u8221\'20\'1D blockchain. She also mentioned Bitcoin in her post, but the largest crypto did not get praise from Walker. Instead, BTC was referred to as an example of an \u8220\'20\'1Cinefficient\u8221\'20\'1D blockchain. On the first day of the week, the candidate encountered some backlash on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  after writing that blockchains could solve the water crisis. Many users did not share her enthusiasm for the cutting-edge technology. However, she explained that it could be possible to enhance \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , compliance and consumption management by integrating blockchain and IoT technologies.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=183269;size=336x280;setID=558953"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here}}}\par \par \uc2 Ads\par \par \uc2 Amazon\uc2  to help burn 140 million SHIB, here\u8217\'20\'19s how much will be burned via e-commerce giant\par \par \uc2 According to @shib_superstore, a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account created by Travis Johnson, by the end of September, the amount of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/amazon-to-help-burn-140-million-shib-heres-how-much-will-be-burned-via-e-commerce-giant"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 burned SHIB}}}\uc2  is likely to surpass 140 million meme tokens, or $1,500 in fiat equivalent. The \uc2 Amazon\uc2  affiliate program that Johnson began to use earlier this year is going to help him do that. The amount of SHIB burned via \uc2 Amazon\uc2  at this pace will be roughly 27,649,769 SHIB evaluated at $300. In the meantime, the pace at which the community is removing SHIB tokens from circulation appears to have slowed down. Even with 40% of it having already been sent to dead-end wallets and locked in them permanently, the price still would not skyrocket to $1 or even to $0.001, as many had hoped earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Document UTDAY00020220921ei9l0018h\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Here Are 3 Reasons Ripple XRP Price is Set For an Enormous Explosion\b0\par\par\uc2 710 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 September 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 XRP's price has fallen this year, as has the price of many other cryptocurrencies. The large-cap coin has dropped 52.3% since the beginning of the year, mirroring the overall declines of the cryptocurrency market, which is not surprising given its position.\par \par \uc2 XRP, despite its decline, remains an appealing investment option for investors. As the year closes out, there is renewed hope that the coin's value will rise. This article will share three reasons for this hope.\par \par \uc2 Ripple\uc2 's XRP token has become the market's de facto standard for cross-border payments, and it has a significant use case for investors looking to earn and users requiring crypto-specific functionality.\par \par \uc2 SEC Case Could Come to a Close\par \par \uc2 The case between XRP's developer, California-based \uc2 Ripple Labs\uc2 , and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  (SEC) has been a major impediment for the past year and a half.\par \par \uc2 In December 2020, the securities regulator sued \uc2 Ripple\uc2 , accusing the company of violating securities laws when it offered XRP to investors in its initial coin offering (\uc2 ICO\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 The case has significantly impacted XRP, including the asset's delisting from several cryptocurrency exchanges. However, it may have far-reaching market implications because it may pave the way for the SEC to classify digital assets as securities in the future.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, there was renewed optimism last week that \uc2 Ripple\uc2  would prevail in this legal battle. Both parties sought summary judgment in separate {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082/gov.uscourts.nysd.551082.642.0.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 filings}}}\uc2  with the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.\par \par \uc2 These judgments are filed when a party believes there is enough evidence to make a decision without a trial. Furthermore, \uc2 Ripple\uc2 's leadership has maintained that the SEC has failed to establish a foundation for classifying XRP as a security.\par \par \uc2 It is unclear whether the SEC case will be resolved soon. Nonetheless, XRP investors are optimistic.\par \par \uc2 CFTC Visit Boosts Prospects for Favorable Classification\par \par \uc2 While battling the SEC over the best classification for XRP, \uc2 Ripple Labs\uc2  appears to be in advanced talks with another financial watchdog.\par \par \uc2 Caroline Pham, the Commissioner of the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  (CFTC), confirmed earlier this week that she met with \uc2 Ripple Labs\uc2  CEO \uc2 Brad Garlinghouse\uc2  as part of her "learning tour" on cryptocurrency. The visit raised hopes that XRP could be classified as a commodity rather than a security, as the SEC desires.\par \par \uc2 Proponents of cryptocurrencies have repeatedly argued that the CFTC should regulate them. Thus, Pham's visit to \uc2 Ripple\uc2  and her interaction with Garlinghouse raises the sentiment of holders as well as the position of law enforcement and regulators.\par \par \uc2 Energy Consumption in the Spotlight\par \par \uc2 For over a year, the crypto market has been admonished for its role in \uc2 climate change\uc2 . \uc2 Tesla\uc2  has stopped accepting Bitcoin as payment, and several legislators have expressed their disdain for digital assets and their excessive resource consumption.\par \par \uc2 However, \uc2 Ripple\uc2  wishes to alter the narrative. Earlier this week, \uc2 Ripple Labs\uc2  announced that it had signed the Climate Pledge, joining over 375 other companies working to create an energy-positive future.\par \par \uc2 The market's focus will likely remain on energy consumption. Ethereum recently completed its proof-of-stake (PoS) transition, which is expected to reduce up to 0.2% of global carbon emissions. \uc2 Ripple\uc2  is putting itself at the forefront of this battle to stay ahead of the curve for good.\par \par \uc2 Tamadoge: Perfect for Investors Looking for Gains\par \par \uc2 Although XRP appears to be an intriguing asset, there are other massive opportunities for investors to profit. One such opportunity is presented by Tamadoge (TAMA).\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://tamadoge.io/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tamadoge}}}\uc2 , which debuted in 2022, bills itself as a "play-to-earn Dogecoin." Presently, it is among the most popular projects in blockchain gaming, allowing players to earn via its native TAMA token. The platform is also attempting to break into the metaverse, with its native Tamaverse launching soon.\par \par \uc2 TAMA recently completed its presale, raising a total of $19 million. This presale outperformed that of several well-known cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum. TAMA is now expected to list on centralized exchanges, making it more accessible to investors. With the Tamadoge platform expected to be fully operational in the fourth quarter of this year, it might be best to buy the coin now.\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020220921ei9l000ru\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

The \uc2 environmental\uc2  myth of proof of stake is underscored by a neo-Luddite belief that replacing inefficient humans and their infrastructure with economical and energy-intensive machines is a net negative \u8212\'20\'14 an ideology that harkens back to the early days of the Industrial Revolution.\par \par \uc2 The Age Of Luddites\par \par \uc2 During the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Luddite Rebellion}}}\uc2  (1811 to 1816), Ned Ludd inspired a movement of highly-skilled English textile workers to resist modernization and destroy a particular kind of mechanized textile machine that would be \u8220\'20\'1C {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://books.google.com/books?id=t7dHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT23#v=onepage&q&f=false"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 hurtful to commonality}}}\uc2 .\u8221\'20\'1D Commonality referred to the common good, as in the tradition of the commons. The machines were seen as a threat to communities and the jobs that were destined to become obsolete. These new textile machines could work harder, faster and cheaper than any group of skilled artisans. It was feared that the machines would also lead to mass unemployment in the community and further unequal power relations. The Luddites protested this technological advancement, sabotaged the machinery and attacked its owners.\par \par \uc2 Over time, Luddite fears were proven wrong. Mechanized technology would not destroy employment. On the contrary, it freed up humans to do more productive and creative things with their time. The vast increase in raw materials translated into even more work for creating increasingly elaborate and cost-effective products. Economic energy-powered technology improves living standards, increases wealth and offers more opportunities for employment.\par \par \uc2 Benefits From Automation\par \par \uc2 Automating human effort with energy-intensive machinery is an age-old practice. In 1582, the English merchant fleet had a carrying capacity of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ft.com/content/f1b30f2c-84aa-4595-84f2-7816796d6841"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 68,000 tons and required 16,000 sailors}}}\uc2 . Commercial fees were used to purchase energy by way of acquiring food, ale, clothing, heat and medicine for tens of thousands of sailors and their families. Security, efficiency, safety and reliability were common issues for these fleets.\par \par \uc2 Today, global shipping uses energy-intensive machines but involves relatively very few humans. The container ship {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOCL_Hong_Kong"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 OOCL Hong Kong}}}\uc2  was the largest container ship ever built, at the time of its 2017 delivery, and can carry 200,000 tons while requiring a crew of only 22. Rather than sourcing power to sustain populations of sailors, we build machines that burn energy and liberate humans from mundane and mechanical tasks. This allows humans to do more productive tasks, which in turn unleashes human flourishing.\par \par \uc2 Modern, energy-intensive container ships are orders of magnitude more efficient and reliable than the merchant fleets of the Middle Ages. It would be thoughtless to assume container ships are wasteful simply because they use more energy than sailing ships. Machines, while energy intensive, replace the energy-intensive requirements of humans who are better suited to do other tasks.\par \par \uc2 Proof Of Work Is Novel Technology\par \par \uc2 Proof of work uses energy-intensive machines that put people in traditional finance out of work and frees them up to do more productive things for society so that they too can acquire the ability to purchase energy-intensive activities. Outdated finance jobs become automated and the new energy-intensive work of global settlement moves to smaller groups of miners in rural communities who have access to stranded power \u8212\'20\'14 reversing some of the destructive power relationships that Luddites rebelled against more than a century ago.\par \par \uc2 Instead of massive buildings full of energy-consuming bean counters \u8212\'20\'14 secured and backed by energy-intensive governments and militaries around the world \u8212\'20\'14 we now have energy-intensive proof-of-work mining machines that effectively guess the number of beans for global settlement, every 10 minutes. This process enables dependable, non-stop, global settlement without prejudice, without rest, and for much less overall cost.\par \par \uc2 Proof Of Stake Is Legacy Technology\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1493426204636033027"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Proof of stake is legacy technology}}}\uc2  \u8212\'20\'14 there is nothing new about it. It is a classical form of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1493426205865000962"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 equity and governance}}}\uc2  that has been used for centuries. The tendency for {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/the-value-of-bitcoin-proof-of-work"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 proof-of-stake assets to accumulate in large financial institutions}}}\uc2  makes it an easy target for regulatory capture, which in turn requires more humans working to ensure compliance, maintain control and leads to increased fees. Physical work by machines, competing over real global resources, is the only method that can reduce or eliminate outdated oligopolistic governance and repressive fees while ensuring censorship resistance.\par \par \uc2 In a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-vitalik-buterin-creator"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 recent interview with Noah Smith}}}\uc2 , Ethereum Co-Founder \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2  boasted that Ethereum could very well have a larger security budget than Bitcoin, in the future. This is a tacit admission that he expects that Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s elite validators will have significantly more energy-purchasing power than Bitcoin miners do. After all, the ability to purchase energy is entirely limited by a network\u8217\'20\'19s security budget, which are the fees, rewards and revenue that are extracted from its users.\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s in this light that one can see that proof of stake is a group of wealthy elites \u8212\'20\'14 a new breed of bankers running an inefficient database \u8212\'20\'14 charging high fees and extracting greater shares of revenue to make their time and efforts worthwhile. These elite insiders don\u8217\'20\'19t want you to consider that security budgets and pre-mined income will be used to buy their own energy. Whether the energy is purchased for humans or machines doesn\u8217\'20\'19t make much difference beyond feel-good corporate carbon accounting. The environment doesn\u8217\'20\'19t care about accounting tricks.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s low energy bill is a diversion from what its security budget is spent on. It is an ESG sleight of hand \u8212\'20\'14 a ruse on the gullible and environmentally conscious. You\u8217\'20\'19ll pay high fees to move your money and Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s elite will rake in profits to buy yachts, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-17/the-pursuit-of-crypto-happiness-wen-lambo"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 sports cars}}}\uc2  and carbon-intensive services \u8212\'20\'14 laughing all the way to their own bank.\par \par \uc2 Security Budgets Are Energy Budgets\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s block reward will halve every four years \u8212\'20\'14 meaning miners will increasingly be supported by the fees users are willing to pay for open global settlement. Since Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://medium.com/cryptonerds/how-bitcoins-disinflation-will-save-the-world-4ae80de9418c"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 disinflationary}}}\uc2  nature encourages savings rather than spending, Buterin predicts network activity and fees will dwindle. He doesn\u8217\'20\'19t mention that miners would not have the funds to purchase much energy in such a scenario and would fall into an energy consumption equilibrium, just like every automated technology throughout history.\par \par \uc2 An Ethereum with a larger security budget than Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s, as Buterin predicts, would enable Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s elite to purchase more energy than Bitcoin miners. Enriching proof-of-stake validators for energy degrowth will not help humanity progress or solve \uc2 environmental\uc2  problems \u8212\'20\'14 it only obscures the carbon-intensive energy its insiders will purchase with their high security budgets.\par \par \uc2 Rather than encouraging degrowth of services, it would be far better for humanity to focus on economically {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://qz.com/1950381/the-case-for-producing-way-more-solar-energy-than-we-need/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 overbuilding cheap, renewable power}}}\uc2  for a future that will need considerably more energy as a greater number of services are electrified. If Buterin\u8217\'20\'19s predictions come true, and Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s power consumption drops with coin issuance, overbuilt renewable energy can be repurposed for other uses.\par \par \uc2 Revenues And Energy\par \par \uc2 Of course, one dollar of revenue does not equal one dollar of energy purchases \u8212\'20\'14 particularly when Bitcoin excels at sourcing the cheapest energy in low demand. However, even if all the beneficiaries of Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s pre-mine, high fees and staking rewards consume low-carbon-intensity lifestyles, the money can and likely will flow into carbon-intensive activities.\par \par \uc2 Visa\uc2 , \uc2 Mastercard\uc2  and \uc2 American Express\uc2  combined annually {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 consume less than 1%}}}\uc2  of the electricity that Bitcoin uses in a year. However, corporate energy consumption obscures the full picture. These companies pay employees large salaries \u8212\'20\'14 which are spent on energy-intensive activities \u8212\'20\'14 for a task that machines can do faster, cheaper and continuously. Traditional retail payments {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-energy-per-transaction-metric-is-misleading"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 take days to settle}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://app.frbservices.org/resources/financial-services/wires/operating-hours.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 do not do so at all on holidays}}}\uc2 , while Bitcoin payments settle reliably every 10 minutes. The revenue that a payment rail extracts from users is a clue as to how many resources it really consumes.\par \par \uc2 If \uc2 Amazon\uc2  economically replaced nearly all of its warehouse employees with robots, critics might characterize \uc2 Amazon\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s higher energy bill as an \uc2 environmental\uc2  disaster. However, robots would be consuming raw energy, instead of humans receiving a salary to buy energy. It\u8217\'20\'19s all energy purchases one way or another and there\u8217\'20\'19s no way around that.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin automates global settlement in a similar manner to robotization \u8212\'20\'14 trading energy-intensive human bean counters for more efficient and cost-effective bean guessers that have a more transparent energy bill.\par \par \uc2 As Nikola Tesla opined more than a century ago, the efficiency savings from machines leads to human progress and an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.teslacollection.com/tesla_articles/1900/century_magazine/nikola_tesla/the_problem_of_increasing_human_energy"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ever-increasing demand for energy}}}\uc2 .

If it did, it would quickly become apparent that corporate-based carbon accounting {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/LynAldenContact/status/1483216986498908165"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 is window dressing}}}\uc2  and there is no working plan to provide cheap renewable energy to all of humanity. Rather, the plan is for wealthy people to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://medium.com/avalancheavax/ccri-finds-avalanche-to-consume-35-000x-less-energy-than-ethereum-and-200-000x-less-than-bitcoin-70ba519d22c3"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 virtue signal about their green enterprises}}}\uc2  and extract more money from users to buy more energy-intensive activities with their profits. That won\u8217\'20\'19t solve real \uc2 environmental\uc2  problems and won\u8217\'20\'19t advance humanity in any way.\par \par \uc2 The reality is that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/jorkney5/status/1570490990267633664"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 environmental problems are often engineering challenges}}}\uc2  that Luddism and degrowth cannot solve.

This development was crucial for the success of Decentralized Financing (DeFi) and NFTs, two of the main forces behind the current cryptocurrency boom.\par \par \uc2 With successful completion of the Merge, the proof-of-work approach that crypto miners used to compete to add new transactions to Ethereum's ledger and get rewards from the network is now defunct. Most Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now mined in dedicated mining operations, or "farms." As a result of mining's high energy use, several nations have restricted the industry.\par \par \uc2 The Miners Plight\par \par \uc2 The PoW approach, pioneered by Bitcoin, is to blame for Ethereum's exorbitant energy usage and has added to the poor public image of the blockchain sector. Ethereum's new method, which uses proof-of-stake, does away with mining and its associated high energy costs and negative \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact.\par \par \uc2 However, miners who have put a lot of time and money into the sector and depend on it are outraged that they have been deserted. They regret their decision of mining and want to stick to more reliable investments than ETH mining. Miners are now more inclined towards the XDCNetwork node in order to benefit from its rapid expansion and promising future.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/lucaschua6/status/1570290842618961920?s=46&t=7Aq3t5cNORYwD3eB6pkwPA"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/lucaschua6/status/1570290842618961920?s=46&t=7Aq3t5cNORYwD3eB6pkwPA}}}\par \par \uc2 While some argue that ETH 2.0 is still safe, a 51% attack is inevitable at some point. A small group of early adopters and founders currently own more than 51% of all ETH that may be staked. When these privileged few start manipulating the books, honest stakers have nowhere to turn.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/LucasChua6/status/1570281865298444289"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/LucasChua6/status/1570281865298444289}}}\par \par \uc2 To "stake" at least 32 ETH to an untradable address on the Ethereum network, validators now act as miners. A validator must stake more and more ETH in order to increase the likelihood that its transactions will be added to the Ethereum distributed ledger.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 Panda DAO, a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is proposing to dissolve its treasury and repay its investors if the proposal is passed.\par \par \uc2 One of the core developers, who goes by the name Panda on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , revealed the move, noting that its one year of existence has been marred with internal strife between the developers and the protocol's users.\par \par \uc2 "Panda DAO has been online for nearly one year. We've managed to sidestep numerous market downfalls during that time. Yet, the real crisis we faced was dealing with management issues within our DAO."\par \par \uc2 According to him, the project's management through the DAO became difficult, considering some users wanted a focus on short-term gains while others wanted longer-term \uc2 sustainability\uc2 . With the dissenting interests, the developer noted that not much could be done since the core team's powers are limited.\par \par \uc2 It is not uncommon for protocols to have internal strife, which is often times showcased as bankruptcy, as in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/celsius-network-slashes-25-percent-of-its-workforce-amid-potential-insolvency"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the case of Celsius Network}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/voyager-digital-suspends-crypto-trading-deposits-and-withdrawals"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Voyager Digital}}}\uc2 , and Babel Finance. That Panda DAO operates decentralised has made handling its affairs more complicated. However, the developer team said they are proud of what the crypto protocol has achieved through the power of its smart contracts.\par \par \uc2 "The project succeeded, however briefly, because of smart contracts protecting community agreements. We had one for ERC-721, we have one now for the return of PANDA funds, etc. Without smart contracts, we would have never been able to sidestep so much market turmoil while guaranteeing the surety of our users' funds," Panda tweeted.\par \par \uc2 Should the proposal to dissolve the project fly, the protocol will distribute 500 to 700 million PANDA tokens out of the 1.292 billion in circulation to its users. About 50 million tokens will be burnt, while approximately 44.56 million tokens will be used to reward 8 out of the core developers in the project.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220921ei9l00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s Drive The Bitcoin Bullet Train Right Through South Carolina\b0\par\par\uc2 1,523 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 September 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 This is an opinion editorial by Dennis Fassuliotis, founder of South Carolina Blockchain Inc. and co-founder of South Carolina Emerging Technology Association, Inc.\par \par \uc2 Why, you may ask? For starters South Carolina is on the verge of a financial revolution so to speak in terms of building a confluence of support for emerging blockchain technologies that can transform our state.\par \par \uc2 That\u8217\'20\'19s important because although the industry was recognized in 2020 by Senator \uc2 Tom Davis\uc2  (R-Beaufort) with a state Senate resolution, the pandemic forced the nascent state advocacy group to postpone its first major statewide conference. However, now armed with a four year history of Wyoming style legislation, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess123_2019-2020/bills/1158.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 S.C. Senate Resolution 1158}}}\uc2 , and funding from the General Assembly for the State Treasurer\u8217\'20\'19s Office to assess the role of digital currency literacy and emerging technologies for the benefit of the state, we have a clear direction and high-speed rail heading into the station via the member driven {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.sceta.io/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 South Carolina Emerging Tech Association}}}\uc2  (SCETA). The SCETA Bitcoin-centric education and policy initiative {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://scblockchainweek.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SCBlockchainWeek.com}}}\uc2  is planned for the first week of October, and State Treasurer Curtis Loftis will be one of several noteworthy speakers to share their visions about how digital currency education, Bitcoin policy guidance and economic investments in Bitcoin can positively impact the Palmetto State.\par \par \uc2 Some may say that\u8217\'20\'19s a lot of window dressing but not yet a first class ticket, or simply \u8220\'20\'1CCool,\u8221\'20\'1D but here\u8217\'20\'19s the next junction. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://secureservercdn.net/50.62.194.59/xxe.347.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Comment-SEC-ESG-Disclosures-June-17-2022.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 In a letter}}}\uc2  to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), our state treasurer and 21 other state financial officers opposed the proposed \uc2 environmental\uc2 , social and governance (ESG) disclosure rule. Loftis also supports West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore leading the charge against big banks pulling back on credit for new {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bizpacreview.com/2022/08/05/red-states-fight-back-with-all-out-assault-against-woke-banks-we-wont-do-business-with-you-1269993/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 projects in West Virginia}}}\uc2  and other states where the needs of the state don\u8217\'20\'19t quite match up with the woke mentality of stakeholder capitalism whose interests and goals often conflict.\par \par \uc2 Taking on financial powerhouses like \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 , \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2 , \uc2 Wells Fargo\uc2  and \uc2 JPMorgan\uc2  may sound foolhardy \u8212\'20\'14 but not if you\u8217\'20\'19re a Bitcoiner. Wasn\u8217\'20\'19t it Jack Mallers who said at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD2-T7TX2rk"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bitcoin 2022}}}\uc2  that he can see a future where these dinosaurs become extinct if they don\u8217\'20\'19t wake up to the open-source financial revolution? While the critics of this position may say this will cost taxpayers more money, I say principals are expensive. Protecting constitutional rights is not a dollars and cents or even a bitcoin and sats issue. It's all about the cost of freedom and freedoms lost today are gone forever tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 Since when did the cost of freedom outstrip the risks of maintaining the status quo or the mainstream movement? Tell it to the colonists that founded this nation and look back on the economic freedoms that created the behemoth banking industry that is at the heart of the decentralized financial movement. We can be critical of the past and how we got here, but redistribution of wealth in 2022 and beyond is about free markets, education and hard work, not handouts.\par \par \uc2 So for Bitcoiners there\u8217\'20\'19s a clear path forward. Identify the states and leadership within them that already support common causes and court them as allies in the fight against woke politics. Let\u8217\'20\'19s sync our narrative with state financial officers that have taken up the gauntlet to fight against the tyranny of stakeholder capitalism espoused by the \uc2 WEF\uc2 , the financial institutions that align with them and fight back together. This isn\u8217\'20\'19t about proof-of-work versus proof-of-stake. Just look at the policy of regulation by enforcement being waged by the \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  against open source projects like Tornado Cash or the overreach in securities enforcement by the SEC. As an industry, we are at a crossroads. This is about survival, not letting politicians or regulators pick winners and losers in technology, and thriving once we insist on having meaningful legislation, like {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/4356/text"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Lummis-Gillibrand}}}\uc2 , passed so we can innovate and maintain our leadership in world financial markets.\par \par \uc2 With that as a backdrop let\u8217\'20\'19s take a look at another S.C. favorite son, Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and his {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.scott.senate.gov/about/opportunity-agenda"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Opportunity Agenda}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 As a single voter issue there are not many other incumbent members of Congress that you may want to get to know from the standpoint of policy already aligned with Bitcoin. They just don\u8217\'20\'19t see that yet.\par \par \uc2 Sen. Scott\u8217\'20\'19s Opportunity Agenda is a rural economic development initiative focusing on 8,764 opportunity zones all around this great country focused on financial inclusion, quality education, bridging the wealth gap, empowering the innovation economy and balancing the scales of justice. Sound familiar?\par \par \uc2 Let\u8217\'20\'19s court Sen. Scott and educate leadership on how Bitcoiners are working tirelessly to do the exact same things, not just domestically, but globally. Let\u8217\'20\'19s all learn together from the experiment in El Zonte and Bitcoin Beach. We should educate ourselves on how Galoy has developed an open-source wallet to create a community bank with Bitcoin and provide custodial services for their trusted leadership to HODL their Bitcoin for their communities benefit and long-term wealth creation. Show them how you can transfer any amount of Bitcoin, $10 in sats or just one satoshi, instantly, with no bank involved. You can\u8217\'20\'19t do that with Zelle, Venmo, \uc2 PayPal\uc2 , Cashapp or any other service today that isn\u8217\'20\'19t the Lightning Network. That\u8217\'20\'19s huge!\par \par \uc2 In South Carolina some of the areas where 135 opportunity zones have been designated may look to out of staters like developing countries. In a lot of S.C. rural areas residents still deal in cash and cannot get a bank account. In upstate counties, infrastructure left behind by the migration offshore of the textile industry are stranded resources, otherwise unused or underutilized as part of the electricity infrastructure that powered that industry. Facilities that once employed hundreds and even thousands are now warehousing, ironically enough, solar panels.\par \par \uc2 Let Bitcoin lead in those areas ripe for redevelopment with the mining industry in front. They bring hard dollar investment and innovation to any place they locate. The growing number of state associations should be supported by Bitcoiners and can work with local businesses to educate them so mining operations in these areas can pay local vendors in Bitcoin and create a flow of new bitcoin into the community while local high schools open their STEM programs up and develop #STEMFORALL curriculums with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://miprimerbitcoin.io/en/my-first-bitcoin/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 MiPrimerBitcoin}}}\uc2  -type programs teaching anyone that wants to learn.\par \par \uc2 And let\u8217\'20\'19s change the lexicon a bit. Mining requires explanation, but when you first explain to a politician about how transactions are generated through a \u8220\'20\'1Cdigital asset data center,\u8221\'20\'1D (DADCs) they get it immediately. We can share the nuances later. We are in a race with well-established lobbying interests from banking to climate and they don\u8217\'20\'19t care about your personal freedoms. DADCs form the base for a Bitcoin circular economy to develop in partnership with local leaders to break the chain of poverty.\par \par \uc2 Here\u8217\'20\'19s a final thought. In both South and North Carolina we have political leaders that jumped on board the centralized model of data centers. These are massive facilities built by \uc2 Google\uc2 , \uc2 Apple\uc2  and others that have become household names that require even more natural resources and just as much electricity as DADCs. In a push to get more, both states crafted tax incentives to bring in more. But that didn\u8217\'20\'19t happen.\par \par \uc2 Manufacturing incentives are still bringing home the bacon with industry flocking into the Southeast. Economic developers know they can add more jobs with manufacturing and give up less power rather than data centers but when these laws were written no one ever contemplated the production of an intangible asset and the pursuit after that industry. Think about that.\par \par \uc2 So let\u8217\'20\'19s get this train moving. SCBlockchainweek is very pro-Bitcoin and just in time for the midterms, and right after that, presidential candidates will begin coming through early for the primary. There are photo ops, town hall meetings, BBQs, shrimp boils and established political strategists testing concepts in S.C. Why? Because it\u8217\'20\'19s less expensive to lobby in South Carolina. Just about every whistle stop is an hour and a half from Columbia S.C., the state capital, and we pick winners on both sides of the aisle in South Carolina. Let\u8217\'20\'19s run this Bitcoin policy bullet train into the stations that align with Bitcoiner values and impact national policy the old fashion way, as a ground swell of support that tells state legislators what matters to their federal counterparts, making it happen through the power of incumbency. Take a small state with political muscle, add a cohesive national dialogue that benefits the heartland as well as the inner city and let\u8217\'20\'19s beat the banks and the special interest groups at their own game.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by Dennis Fassuliotis.

Looking at other aspects of the mining pool, it was observed that about $15,400 had been paid to miners in the last 24 hours. With over 5483 blocks {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ethw.2miners.com/blocks"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 already mined}}}\uc2 , ETHPoW miners had continued mining at a network difficulty of 388.3 Terahash.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statics.ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screenshot-2022-09-20-at-06.57.34.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image}}}\par \par \uc2 Source: 2Miners.com\par \par \uc2 Coincidentally, the luck at which blocks were mined was the highest since 16 September.

The report pointed out that the industry is early in its adoption phase with \u8220\'20\'1Cplenty of growth to come.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Despite clear signs of substantial market growth for years to come, skeptics still question the effectiveness and \uc2 sustainability\uc2  of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a widely-accepted means of payment. Specifically, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem#:~:text=The%20Bitcoin%20scalability%20problem%20refers,limited%20in%20size%20and%20frequency."}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the question of scalability}}}\uc2  has repeatedly come up as a major obstacle to its widespread adoption.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s focus on security and decentralization limits the ability to handle high throughputs of transactions within the network in short periods of time. This fact is often highlighted by its critics, suggesting that without the ability to quickly process giant blocks of transaction data, receiving payments for something as small as a cup of coffee will result in fees that exceed the price of the beverage itself.\par \par \uc2 If Bitcoin is going to live up to its full potential and become a means of payment in an alternative financial system, users must be able to execute transactions quickly and at a low cost. This is where the Lightning Network comes into play and why mass adoption of the network is critical to the success of Bitcoin becoming a true option for everyday payments.\par \par \uc2 The Lightning Network, a second-layer protocol designed to facilitate micropayment channels at scale brings Bitcoin back to its original purpose as a peer-to-peer payment network by taking transactions off-chain and enabling them to be completed in mere seconds and at a fraction of the cost.\par \par \uc2 According to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinvisuals.com/ln-capacity"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 data}}}\uc2  from BitcoinVisuals, the capacity of the Lightning Network has 4,700.623 bitcoin in liquidity flowing through the protocol at the time of this writing. With the capacity of the Lightning Network steadily {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://arcane.no/research/the-bitcoin-lightning-network-ecosystem-is-growing"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 increasing}}}\uc2  over the past year, even in the face of a bear market, this growth in utilization proves that the technology powering these systems is still in its infancy.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s Real-World Adoption Is Growing\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin has already seen rapid growth and adoption, even being adopted as legal tender in emerging economies such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/el-salvador-bitcoin-one-year-later"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 El Salvador}}}\uc2  \u8217\'20\'19s and the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/how-central-african-republic-can-find-freedom-with-bitcoin"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Central African Republic\u8217\'20\'19s}}}\uc2 . The Lightning Network enables brick-and-mortar shops in these countries to accept bitcoin as payment for Big Macs or frappuccinos, via mobile devices.\par \par \uc2 And the widespread embrace of small cryptocurrency transactions for daily goods and services hasn\u8217\'20\'19t stopped there. Payments apps such as El Salvador\u8217\'20\'19s {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/1-million-salvadorans-now-using-bitcoin-chivo-wallet"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Chivo Wallet}}}\uc2  offer low-cost, high-speed transactions, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/cash-app-integrates-bitcoins-lightning-network"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Cash App integrated the Lightning Network}}}\uc2  in February, making zero-fee bitcoin payments available for its customers. With this widespread adoption, popularity has soared as payment volume on the Lightning Network {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cointelegraph.com/news/cashapp-and-chivo-help-drive-lightning-payment-volume-up-400"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 grew 410% over the past year}}}\uc2 . Additionally, according to a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://arcane.no/research/the-bitcoin-lightning-network-ecosystem-is-growing%5C"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 report}}}\uc2  from Arcane Research, payments on the Lightning Network were available to over 80 million people in March of this year, compared to only 100,000 people back in August 2021.\par \par \uc2 As more cryptocurrency exchanges integrate the Lightning Network into their platforms, the number of people that have access to low-cost, high-speed payments will only continue to grow, making the payments industry ripe for disruption. Even crypto-skeptical superpowers are taking note, as two U.S. senators {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/07/26/us-senators-push-bill-to-make-small-crypto-transactions-tax-free/#:~:text=Prominent%20U.S.%20senators%20are%20trying,Toomey%20(R%2DPa.)"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 introduced legislation}}}\uc2  this summer to make small crypto transactions tax free.\par \par \uc2 But the benefits of Lightning Network go beyond making payments low cost and high speed for the daily user on the go. Some companies are even exploring how they can take this tool of financial freedom and apply it to protecting freedom of speech.\par \par \uc2 Protecting Freedom Of Speech With Bitcoin\par \par \uc2 True decentralization and financial freedom cannot happen without freedom of speech, communication and privacy. While the value of payments on the Lighting Network can be seen in its ability to extend access to low-cost, high-speed cryptocurrency transactions to more people, there is another important utility. Arcane Research\u8217\'20\'19s report found that about 50% of the activity came from peer-to-peer transactions, meaning half of the Lighting Network\u8217\'20\'19s activity came from quickly connecting individuals to each other.\par \par \uc2 As companies are utilizing Lighting Network technology, some are exploring its use for highly secure and private video conferencing or direct messaging. Much has been written about how big tech can harvest the data of its users and sell it to the highest bidder, making this space also ripe for disruption. By offering viable, alternative messaging apps such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://strike.me/en/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Strike}}}\uc2 , {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://sphinx.chat/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Sphinx}}}\uc2  or {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bitrefill.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Bitrefill}}}\uc2  that are easy to use, fast, free and private, true decentralization can be achieved.\par \par \uc2 With wider utilization of the Lighting Network, questions surrounding bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s price viability and its scalability could be answered promptly. Additionally, as cryptocurrency builders are innovating and coming up with ways to further utilize this technology, the Lighting Network could very well be the solution to protecting not just financial freedom, but freedom of speech as well. With cryptocurrency on track to reach one billion users by 2030, the proliferation of the Lighting Network bears watching as more countries and companies make use of its ability to quickly process data at a low cost to the consumer.\par \par \uc2 This is a guest post by \uc2 Paolo Ardoino\uc2 .

They empower innovators and project developers through access to funding, community and partnership building, and a complete support system to help bring premier blockchain games, NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and metaverses to its community through events called IGOs (Initial Gaming offering) and INOs (Initial NFTs offering).\par \par \uc2 Seedify has successfully launched over 50 IGO projects and has now entered the NFT space with an NFT launchpad and marketplace that will attract new members and a new stream of revenue-generating opportunities to its community. They are focused on two verticals, Blockchain Gaming and Metaverse, each with utility based NFTs and tokens, which are imperative for \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , utility, useability and growth.\par \par \uc2 Last month Seedify successfully launched its native NFT token, $SNFTS, via an airdrop which reached almost 60x (at its all-time high). Over 1000+ holders have chosen to farm or stake their $SNFTS, earning passive income. Furthermore, most of them have chosen the 180 days staking pool showing confidence in the long-term performance of the token.\par \par \uc2 In addition, they are now bridging the Metaverse with the recent reveal of its own Profile Picture (PFP) Steampunked-themed Avatar NFT Collection. PFP\u8217\'20\'19s are one of the most popular types of NFTs, usually showcased as profile pictures on social media.\par \par \uc2 Seedify Meta Studios is the creative powerhouse behind this exclusive collection. The in-house multidisciplinary team brings together the industry\u8217\'20\'19s best and strongest talent, who have stretched their creative abilities to create a unique collection with intriguing characters, impressive utilities and a captivating storyline.\par \par \uc2 The Meta Studios team consists of 2D and 3D Concept Artists, Art Directors, Technical Artists, Game Developers and Designers from renowned AAA and Indie game development studios.\par \par \uc2 The AVATARS:\par \par \uc2 The unique set of 2D collectable NFTs will be limited to 10 000 items, with various looks, traits, and wearables. In time, the collection will be interoperable between metaverses and evolve to 3D game-ready avatars. Their visual attributes incorporate intricate details inspired by the vintage steampunk look.\par \par \uc2 Characters include Merchants, Steam Engineers, Alchemists, Tinkerers, Blacksmiths and Crafters, to name but a few.\par \par \uc2 The Narrative:\par \par \uc2 The AVATARS are people who have mastered using gadgetry, metal, steam power and pieced-together machines in their everyday lives. Their love for machines, alchemy, magic, and dreams of time travel united their purpose and broadened their vision and aspirations.\par \par \uc2 Enlightened from their inner being, everything they touched turned to gold, and time had no boundaries as they explored the past, present and future. They were born to engineer, craft, and create something new, something different.\par \par \uc2 Their curiosity became their sail; their understanding became their ships; their wisdom became their anchor. Nations gathered from every race and creed; this gave rise to a new empire built on imagination, dune, sand, and clay.\par \par \uc2 But among them, some infused themselves with a mystical resource called Am\u233\'00\'E9. There were only 1000 of them in the beginning, and they were distinct from the rest as their resemblance became blue and their powers became unmatched.\par \par \uc2 The rest underwent the infusion process, patiently awaiting their transformations. These transformations would solidify their place in the metaverse and equip them for future adventures.\par \par \uc2 The AVATAR utilities:\par \par \uc2 What makes the collection so distinctive is the staking system for the NFTs called \u8220\'20\'1CRace Transfusions\u8221\'20\'1D and \u8220\'20\'1CAm\u233\'00\'E9 Infusions\u8221\'20\'1D these will essentially alter the AVATARS metadata and traits and will forever upgrade their look, making the AVATAR more valuable and rarer.\par \par \uc2 In addition, these systems won\u8217\'20\'19t generate additional NFTs to ensure that the collection is not diluted, and its value is secured.\par \par \uc2 The collection will also include future drops with special utilities embedded through the transfusions and infusions staking system bringing even more value to those owning a piece of the collection.\par \par \uc2 How to get access to Seedify\u8217\'20\'19s Avatar NFT Collection:\par \par \uc2 There are three ways to have a chance at owning one of the 10,000 NFT avatars:\par \par \uc2 * Staking and Farming:\par \par \uc2 * Stake 500k $SNFTS or farm 250k $SNFTS with the $SFUND pair to generate 1 Avatar raffle ticket each month.

Holders will be able to win a maximum of 1 Seedify Avatar per wallet during these snapshots\u8217\'20\'19 phases (A total of 4500 Avatar whitelists will be available)\par \par \uc2 * Seedify NFT Launchpad:\par \par \uc2 Both $SFUND and $SNFTS will allow users to earn a chance for a whitelist spot.

Prior to venturing into politics, she worked as a product manager.\par \par \uc2 The United Utah Party aims to overcome tribalism in politics by focusing on issues that the vast majority of voters can agree on.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=183269;size=336x280;setID=558953"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here}}}\par \par \uc2 Ads\par \par \uc2 On Monday, Walker faced some backlash on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  after tweeting that blockchains could solve the water crisis. Many users did not share her enthusiasm for the cutting-edge technology. "Utah doesn't deserve much, but man, they deserve better than this," one \uc2 Twitter\uc2  user quipped.\par \par \uc2 Walker, however, explains that it could be possible to enhance \uc2 sustainability\uc2 , compliance and consumption management by integrating {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/cardano-blockchain-to-ensure-quality-of-georgian-wine"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 blockchain}}}\uc2  and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://u.today/iot-supply-chain-network-still-needs-final-test-past-ico-review"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 internet-of-things (IoT) technologies}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The third-party candidate is also convinced that blockchain may be able to eliminate the national debt three decades from now and protect users' personal data from social media companies.\par \par \uc2 She believes that people will be able to see the utility of blockchain 10 years from now, likening it to the internet.\par \par \uc2 Walker is running for Utah's 4th Congressional District. She will have to run against Republican Burgess Owens, who won the seat in 2020. Back then, United Utah only managed to get 2.13% of the vote, which means that it is virtually impossible for Walker to win this race.\par \par \uc2 Document UTDAY00020220920ei9k0002u\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Mining\par \b \uc2 Marathon Digital\uc2  CEO Urges to Incentivize Bitcoin Miners for Embracing Renewable Energy\b0\par\par\uc2 Godfrey Benjamin \par \uc2 357 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 September 2022\par \uc2 Blockchain.News\par \uc2 BLCRNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 Fred Thiel\uc2 , the Chief Executive Officer of Bitcoin mining firm \uc2 Marathon Digital\uc2 , has called on the Federal Government to incentivize miners to embrace renewable energy options to mine their cryptocurrencies.\par \par \uc2 Thiel's comments come in an interview following the release of a report by the \uc2 US government\uc2  on the \uc2 environmental\uc2  implications of Bitcoin mining.\par \par \uc2 Known for running a mining outfit with a knack for proper and targeted transition into clean energy, Thiel said the incentivization model would arguably help stir the willingness of stakeholders to embrace clean energy.\par \par \uc2 Using his company as an example, Thiel noted that "unlike other miners who may be on the grid just sucking energy off the grid in competition with consumers, we do it behind the meter." According to him, this relationship is "more symbiotic to the grid versus parasitic."\par \par \uc2 The clamour behind the \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact of Bitcoin mining comes off as a major regulatory push for most governments worldwide. The subject is held as a major concern that the Chinese government has banned every mining and crypto-related activity, causing a tectonic shift in the mining and broader crypto ecosystem in mid-2021.\par \par \uc2 With a 'responsible' shift away from the \uc2 environmental\uc2  concerns of Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, one of Ethereum's reasons for transitioning into the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/the-merge-is-complete-ethereum"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 through the merge}}}\uc2  is that when out last week. Thiel's recommendation, if taken, may help to nudge miners, particularly the established ones operating in the US, to invest in clean energy.\par \par \uc2 "If you provide an incentive for miners to co-locate behind the mediator at renewable energy plants, then miners are going to move there," he said.\par \par \uc2 To Thiel, the report from the government somehow encouraged stakeholders to look at the bright side of mining crypto with renewable energy.\par \par \uc2 He said this highlights how the regulators are beginning to warm up to the idea and importance of Bitcoin and PoW mining in general. While he acknowledges that full appreciation may take time, he believes the government is currently positively disposed to welcome sound regulation.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220920ei9k00003\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Though NFTs have existed since 2014, their popularity skyrocketed in 2021, with trading volumes crossing $23 billion by the end of the year.\par \par \uc2 It was during this height of popularity that numerous prominent retail brands like Gap, Gucci, \uc2 Dolce & Gabbana\uc2 , Adidas, \uc2 Nike\uc2 , and others began embracing NFTs in a bid to prepare for the transition to Web3 and the Metaverse.\par \par \uc2 Underlining this successful approach, recent data published by NFTGators highlights that most of these brands have raked in millions of dollars from their NFT sales. The report revealed that \uc2 Dolce & Gabbana\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s total NFT revenue this year stands at around $25.6 million, with Gucci\u8217\'20\'19s sales reaching approximately $11.5 million, and Adidas\u8217\'20\'19 comparable figure totaling nearly $10.9 million.\par \par \uc2 Nike\uc2  dominates this list, registering more than $185 billion from its digital sales. The data further indicates that \uc2 Nike\uc2  has generated nearly $1.3 billion in transaction volume via secondary trading of its NFTs, which adds to roughly $93 million worth of primary assets and has so far generated more than $92 million in royalties.\par \par \uc2 Back in 2021, \uc2 Nike\uc2  acquired RTKFT - the NFT startup behind the CloneX NFT collection. \uc2 Nike\uc2  purchased the platform within two weeks after the CloneX NFT collection was launched for auction, making it evident that the brand is interested in expanding its presence across Web3 and the Metaverse. Despite weak crypto market conditions, \uc2 Nike\uc2 \u8217\'20\'19s NFTs transaction reached a total of 6.362 ETH in August 2022, cementing the idea that consumers are becoming increasingly receptive to NFTs.\par \par \uc2 There are several reasons behind this trend of an increasing number of mainstream brands embracing NFTs. For starters, the NFT ecosystem has evolved from a technology-dense niche for crypto and blockchain enthusiasts to an ecosystem that is now more user-friendly and accessible for the average consumer.\par \par \uc2 The accelerated adoption of mainstream technology like Web3 and the metaverse has also contributed to NFTs\u8217\'20\'19 popularity, primarily because NFTs are acting as the bridge connecting these futuristic ecosystems.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, from a brand\u8217\'20\'19s perspective, embracing NFTs gives them an additional revenue source and helps them connect with customers - most of whom hail from younger, tech-savvy generations. Several brands have already showcased that NFTs can be a proven way to improve brand awareness, customer engagement, and brand loyalty.\par \par \uc2 Beyond Luxury Brands\par \par \uc2 The good news is that this adoption isn\u8217\'20\'19t just limited to mainstream brands. Several emerging blockchain projects are continuously unlocking new use cases, some of which can help lay the foundation for bigger brands to experiment further with NFTs.\par \par \uc2 Take, for instance, the case of the blockchain startup RSK (Rootstock Network). The startup recently announced that its partner, WakeUp Labs, has signed a long-term strategic collaboration with another climate-tech startup, Kilimo, to introduce the concept of \u8220\'20\'1Cwater neutrality\u8221\'20\'1D NFTs.\par \par \uc2 WakeUp Labs is an \uc2 environmental\uc2 -friendly protocol built on top of RSK. In partnership with Kilimo, WakeUp Labs will help verify the water consumption of agriculture-based businesses.\par \par \uc2 Through this tie-up, WakeUp will supply the required infrastructure to issue tokenized certificates (known as \u8220\'20\'1CVerification NFTs\u8221\'20\'1D) to all agricultural businesses and organizations that have established responsible water consumption models.\par \par \uc2 Each participant\u8217\'20\'19s water savings will be reflected as an exclusive NFT minted on top of RSK. Accordingly, other businesses and organizations can purchase these NFTs to compensate Kilimo\u8217\'20\'19s clients for contributing to reduced water consumption. Simply put, this model unlocks an additional revenue stream for agricultural businesses, organizations, and individuals who use water efficiently.\par \par \uc2 Another emerging solution that aims to unlock a new use case for NFTs is BridgeChamp. This play-to-earn game built on Jelurida\u8217\'20\'19s Ardor blockchain leverages Jelurida\u8217\'20\'19s unique parent chain-child chain architecture. The BridgeChamp team is currently working on adding more utility to its in-game rewards and NFTs by partnering with merchant stores, outlets, and other retail brands.\par \par \uc2 BridgeChamp is the first platform to facilitate on-chain bridge play. It has built an ecosystem where players can play casually and competitively. Players can also create or join tournaments, host competitions, practice their skills, and much more. The platform has integrated a real-world bridge play experience with blockchain technology, ensuring that anyone can access it from both mobile devices and web browsers.\par \par \uc2 It is important to note that, unlike other blockchain games that are deployed on top of the chain or a side chain, BridgeChamp is a native blockchain that operates as the child-chain of Ardor. Since child chains may have a few limitations, it also uses Jelurida\u8217\'20\'19s Ignis blockchain as the parent chain to remove all limitations that Ardor exhibits. This approach essentially grants both developers and users access to all features that must be tailored specifically to meet real-world bridge gaming standards.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

\par\par \uc2 Ethereum\par \b \uc2 Ethereum Energy consumption, Carbon Footprint Reduce 99.99% after Merge\b0\par\par\uc2 Nicholas Otieno \par \uc2 385 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 September 2022\par \uc2 Blockchain.News\par \uc2 BLCRNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 According to the report issued on Thursday September 15, Ethereum's energy usage and carbon footprint have both dropped even more than anticipated after the Merger upgrade .\par \par \uc2 The report said Ethereum now uses approximately 99.99% less energy after the merge was completed. It further mentioned that the blockchain's carbon footprint has also fallen by over 99.99%.\par \par \uc2 In the past, the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2  estimated that the merge would cut the network's energy consumption by approximately 99.95%.\par \par \uc2 The CCRI report disclosed that Ethereum's overall electricity consumes just 2,600-megawatt hours per year, compared to 23 million megawatt hours before the merge. As a result, Ethereum's estimated annual CO2 emissions have fallen from over 11 million tons to just under 870 less than the combined total of 100 average American homes, per the \uc2 U.S. \uc2 Environmental\uc2  Protection Agency\uc2  (\uc2 EPA\uc2 ).\par \par \uc2 In a statement yesterday, Uli Gallersd rfer, CCRI co-founder and CEO, said that Ethereum's green credentials are now at par with other energy-efficient blockchain networks that started with a proof-of-stake consensus model, rather than transitioning to it as Ethereum just did.\par \par \uc2 However, Ethereum's move to proof of stake (PoS) consensus model has not gone well with some industry stakeholders. Ethereum miners, who used to run powerful computers to secure the network and earn ETH rewards through mining, have moved on to mine cryptocurrency on other networks.\par \par \uc2 Miners have moved their powerful rigs to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/ethereum-classic-hash-rate-surges-200-percent-ahead-of-ethereum-merge"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 other blockchain networks}}}\uc2  like Ethereum Classic (ETC), Ravencoin (RVN), and Ergo (\uc2 ERG\uc2 ) to do mining.\par \par \uc2 Why the Merge Is Important\par \par \uc2 Ethereum's switch to {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/ethereums-switch-to-proof-of-stake-will-be-substantial-to-the-industry-binance-research-suggests"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 proof of stake}}}\uc2  has been planned since 2014, before the official deployment of the blockchain. Due to its technical complexity and the increasingly large amount of money at risk, the upgrade has been delayed several times.\par \par \uc2 The Merge is part of what in the past was called "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/ethereum-launches-eth-2.0-multiclient-testnet-medalla"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ether 2.0}}}\uc2 ," a series of upgrades that reshape the blockchain's foundations.\par \par \uc2 The move, known as "the Merge," is of huge consequence. The major network upgrade, which saw Ethereum transition from PoW to PoS, was designed to address concerns about its \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact, dramatically improve its transaction speed, and boost the value of Ethereum, among other improvements.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220919ei9j00006\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw264\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3960\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Is the Biden Crypto Framework Bullish or Bearish for Crypto Prices?\b0\par\par\uc2 509 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 September 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 The administration of President \uc2 Joe Biden\uc2  has recently released a regulatory framework for digital assets, but key participants in the space do not believe it adequate.\par \par \uc2 A fact sheet describing the steps taken to regulate the cryptocurrency industry was made public by the White House on Friday. Despite prior requests for a uniform regulatory framework, stakeholders in the industry have criticized the recently implemented plan, pointing out its many flaws.\par \par \uc2 The framework intends to "Protect Consumers, Investors, Businesses, Financial Stability, National Security, and the Environment," according to the White House report. However, U.S. Representative Patrick McHenry {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://myemail.constantcontact.com/McHenry-Statement-on-Biden-Administration-s-Digital-Assets-Reports.html?soid=1133131444985&aid=Zc4ZLeZUsqU"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pointed out}}}\uc2  that the plan is lacking in a number of crucial respects.\par \par \uc2 McHenry claims that the White House reports are an unacceptable surrogate for true "legislative clarity." He further highlighted that the reports concentrate on the risks that digital assets pose rather than recognizing their critical contribution to fostering innovation in the United States.\par \par \uc2 Besides McHenry, the Blockchain Association {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theblockchainassociation.org/blockchain-association-reacts-to-biden-administrations-executive-order-on-digital-assets-findings/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 excoriated}}}\uc2  the Biden Administration's regulatory stance. According to Kristin Smith, Executive Director of the Blockchain Association, the United States has lost a chance to solidify its position as a worldwide leader in the cryptocurrency industry with this strategy.\par \par \uc2 Like McHenry, Smith mentioned that the reports lost sight of opportunities and moved their attention to crypto risks, skipping a chance to offer suggestions for promoting innovation in the industry.\par \par \uc2 "This is surprising given the clear instructions from the [executive order] and work from members of Congress to move things forward," Warren added. Additionally, U.S. Senator Patrick Toomey said reports are not a sufficient substitute for actual regulatory measures.\par \par \uc2 The U.S. is ramping up crypto regulatory measures\par \par \uc2 Notwithstanding, a few industry experts have expressed satisfaction with the recently published reports. Ben Gray, General Counsel at FinTech firm Paxos Trust Company, commended the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 . Gray noted his pleasure in the fact that the government is putting in efforts to make sure related agencies are enforcing the proper rules.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency advocate U.S. Representative Jim Himes applauded the Biden Administration for the move. Himes expressed his delight in the fact that there is at least a move towards proper cryptocurrency regulation.\par \par \uc2 The nine reports came 6 months following President Biden's executive order. The order that the president signed in March received several commendations from industry players. These recent reports have fallen short of the expectations of the broader crypto community.\par \par \uc2 The United States has recently ramped up its crypto regulatory approaches, as adoption sees a major spike. Nonetheless, the measures have met criticisms rather than acclaim. This is due in large part to the fact that major industry players believe these measures are likely to stifle innovation in the sector.\par \par \uc2 Last week the White House released a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/09/08/fact-sheet-climate-and-energy-implications-of-crypto-assets-in-the-united-states/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 report}}}\uc2  highlighting the \uc2 environmental\uc2  concerns of crypto mining. In response, founder of \uc2 MicroStrategy\uc2  and Bitcoin maximalist, \uc2 Michael Saylor\uc2  noted that the reports are aimed at undermining Bitcoin. Saylor said the report is "full of misinformation generated and promulgated by unscrupulous crypto promoters."\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020220917ei9h0005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

It seems to leave a lot to be desired for socially acceptable behavior, and yet, they\u8217\'20\'19re ranked No. 1.\par \par \uc2 PepsiCo Inc\uc2 . comes in at No. 12. While diabetes is the direct cause of death only 4% of the time, it is listed as a contributing factor in deaths as often as 11.5%, putting it in third place \u8212\'20\'14 {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://diabetestalk.net/diabetes/diabetes-leading-cause-of-death"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 behind heart disease and cancer}}}\uc2  in the list of America\u8217\'20\'19s greatest killers.

It has a native asset, undilutable by nation-states and resistant to seizure and censorship.\par \par \uc2 It banks the unbanked and it banks the debanked, protecting them from the ravages of global hyperinflation \u8212\'20\'14 a phenomenon that those in the developing world know far too well.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin has no agenda, no values to force upon its user base as a means to appease the capital allocation gods from the likes of \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 . Bitcoin just is. Bitcoin just does. Without judgment, without discrimination, without redlining, without opening fake accounts on your behalf, without paying billions of dollars in fines every year, without giving you diabetes or censoring your search results.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin is rules without rulers \u8212\'20\'14 where everyone is treated equally, because there\u8217\'20\'19s no way to do anything but.

The hype surrounding the Merge is now over, but Ethereum will now need another short-term catalyst.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://servedbyadbutler.com/go2/;ID=183269;size=336x280;setID=558953"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click here}}}\par \par \uc2 Ads\par \par \uc2 Ethereum risks further 31% drop\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 #Ethereum}}}\uc2  | You don't want {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 $ETH}}}\uc2  to dip below $1,460 because it could trigger a sell-off that sends it to $1,000. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ETH?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 #ETH}}}{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.co/sCoqWE90Nz"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 pic.twitter.com/sCoqWE90Nz}}}\par \par \uc2 \u8212\'20\'14 Ali (@ali_charts) {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1570466697324400640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 September 15, 2022}}}\par \par \uc2 According to Crypto analystAli Martinez, Ethereum might risk a further drop to $1,000, which represents a 31% decline from current prices in the event of a decisive break beneath the $1,460 support.\par \par \uc2 Ahead of the Merge, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://insights.glassnode.com/the-week-onchain-week-32-2022/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Glassnode}}}\uc2  reported that a futures and options backward movement after September indicated that a "sell-the-news" assumption was in play ahead of the event. On-chain analytics firm Glassnode also highlighted the fact that futures traders were pricing ETH at a discount post-Merge and were willing to pay a premium for downside protection. This is based on the relatively lower demand for ETH exposure via options after the Merge event.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency prices have fallen this year along with those of other risky investments as a result of tighter monetary policy being implemented to combat excessive inflation. The Merge, however, is thought to be a longer-term driver for Ether because it boosts Ethereum's \uc2 environmental\uc2  image.\par \par \uc2 Document UTDAY00020220916ei9g000rt\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

Ethereum has shown it's possible to switch to an energy-efficient protocol with far less climate, air and water pollution. Other cryptocurrency protocols have operated on efficient consensus mechanisms for years. Bitcoin has become the outlier, defiantly refusing to accept its climate responsibility,"\par \par \uc2 Ethereum now more centralised\par \par \uc2 Now that ethereum has switched to the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism it will certainly be a huge amount less energy intensive - around 99.5% less to be more precise.\par \par \uc2 However, what is the downside with this switch? From now on ethereum will be a lot less decentralised, given that wealthy players on the network can start to up their stake and therefore have a huge say in how ethereum develops into the future.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin is unique\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin was developed to be the very opposite of this. The proof-of-work consensus mechanism is part of the very fabric of what Bitcoin is. It gives Bitcoin its super security, and provides decentralisation across the planet.\par \par \uc2 A Galaxy Digital report on Bitcoin energy consumption compared with the banking industry found that Bitcoin used a lot less than half the energy of the banking system.\par \par \uc2 Central bank manipulation\par \par \uc2 The fiat-based monetary system that has been in use for decades now is sucking the life out of those who hold fiat currencies. Central banks play god and print incredible amounts of currency, which has the effect of debasement and of severely decreasing the purchasing power of all those who use fiat currencies and who save them in the bank.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin may be using a lot of energy right now, but it is on the path towards a goal of negligible use of energy and a green future.\par \par \uc2 However, that isn\u8217\'20\'19t the main point. Even if Bitcoin did use a certain amount of energy, it would be absolutely worthwhile in order to give people a liferaft that they can use in order to protect their financial future.\par \par \uc2 Mainstream media has done its level best to besmirch Bitcoin in any way possible, and the \uc2 environmental\uc2  card is one of the very best it can play in the current situation.\par \par \uc2 The environmentalists have been conned\par \par \uc2 However, the likes of action groups like Greenpeace, who do such wonderful work across the world in bringing \uc2 environmental\uc2  issues into the public eye, should really do their research properly.\par \par \uc2 Greenpeace, the \uc2 Environmental\uc2  Working Group\uc2 , and other organisations that are trying to save our planet must not be misdirected by those who are embedded in our corrupt monetary system and who would seek to bring Bitcoin down any way they can.\par \par \uc2 This code can\u8217\'20\'19t be manipulated\par \par \uc2 Understanding Bitcoin is a long process and has taken many experts much time and study before they were able to see the absolute necessity of such an asset.\par \par \uc2 The Bitcoin code is a thing of beauty. It does not respond to any criticisms or praise. It just keeps on producing block after block, just as it was programmed to do. No governments or federal agencies have any say in it. It is the world\u8217\'20\'19s last chance for an asset that can be owned and spent at the whim of the individual, without any interference from any person or authority. The sooner the world\u8217\'20\'19s population realises this, then the sooner we can move back to a hard, sound monetary system.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The group's intentions are to have these institutions somehow help change the consensus mechanism from PoW to proof-of-stake (PoS).\par \par \uc2 The intensification of an attack that began in March with the launch of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/greenpeace-seeks-to-change-bitcoin-code"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CChange The Code, Not The Climate\u8221\'20\'1D}}}\uc2  campaign follows today\u8217\'20\'19s completion of the Merge, an event which changed the consensus mechanism of Ethereum from PoW to PoS.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CEthereum has shown it's possible to switch to an energy-efficient protocol with far less climate, air and water pollution,\u8221\'20\'1D said \uc2 Michael Brune\uc2 , director of the Change the Code, Not the Climate campaign.\par \par \uc2 However, one could argue that these climate groups are missing something very important about Bitcoin. Not only is PoW the true innovation and core to the successful functioning of Bitcoin, this would not be the first occurrence of institutional and corporate pressure to change the Bitcoin protocol.\par \par \uc2 Accordingly, the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-limit"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Block Size Wars}}}\uc2  saw many institutions arguing for larger block sizes on the blockchain which would have led to the centralization of nodes on the network, thereby lessening the distributed network we see today. Attempts to centralize the network ultimately failed as the decentralized network stood strong and an upgrade known as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/what-is-segwit"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 SegWit}}}\uc2  allowed for necessary upgrades to block sizes without centralizing the infrastructure of Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, climate-based criticism of Bitcoin is becoming more debunked by the day. In fact, yesterday the executive chairman for pro-Bitcoin software analytics firm \uc2 MicroStrategy\uc2  published a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.michael.com/en/resources/bitcoin-mining-and-the-environment"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 paper}}}\uc2  refuting many common accusations.\par \par \uc2 Document BTCMAG0020220915ei9f0008d\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Synthetix (SNX), eCash (XEC) Dwindle; Chronoly.io Dazzles Crypto Market With Meteoric Rise\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 723 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 The crypto market has been harsh in recent times. Synthetix Network (SNX) and eCash (XEC) are struggling to post sustainable growth after suffering a downfall during the recent market crash. Meanwhile, Chronoly.io\u8217\'20\'19s (CRNO) pre-sale ended on a high note, with its token registering a 690% growth in its value. Investors are convinced with Chronoly.io (CRNO) as all its CRNO tokens were sold out during the pre-sale phase.\par \par \uc2 Synthetix (SNX) Grapples With Unsustainable Growth\par \par \uc2 Although the Synthetix Network (SNX) witnessed an unusual increase in its trade volume after Atomic Swap integration with Kwenta and 1inch recently, there are still some red flags for the project. The Synthetix Network (SNX) has not been able to sustain its growth, with the price of its token dipping at regular intervals. Therefore, the project is attempting to revamp the platform with a new proposal that would cap SNX\u8217\'20\'19s maximum supply at 300 million. However, it cannot be ascertained that the new proposal would put the SNX in the green zone. Currently, SNX is being traded at $3.03, which is 89.46% below its all-time high of $28.77.\par \par \uc2 Synthetix Network (SNX) is also called the "blue chip" DeFi project and was developed to broaden the cryptocurrency\u8217\'20\'19s territory by introducing non-blockchain assets. Synthetix Network (SNX) is an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol. The Synthetix Network (SNX) aims to facilitate the creation of "synths," a nomenclature for synthetic assets.\par \par \uc2 eCash (XEC) Goes To Negative Territory Again\par \par \uc2 eCash (XEC) has once again plunged after registering an increase in its price last week. This lack of positive momentum has made investors wary of the project\u8217\'20\'19s \uc2 sustainability\uc2  in the long run. Currently, eCash (XEC) is being traded at $0.000044, whereas its price was $0.000048 last week. Notably, the current price of eCash (XEC) is about 99% below its all-time high of $0.01. Experts say that the platform needs to increase its overall trade volume to find a balance.\par \par \uc2 eCash (XEC) is a cryptocurrency that can be used as electronic cash. XEC aims to become a form of digital currency that anyone can use across the world. Developers of eCash want to make XEC a means of financial transaction. They also say that eCash (XEC) will be interoperable within the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector.\par \par \uc2 Chronoly.io Widens its Market Lead by 690% Among its Peers\par \par \uc2 Chronoly.io (CRNO), through its native token CRNO, aims to decentralize and bring more liquidity to the luxury watch marketplace. Chronoly.io (CRNO) has amazed crypto investors worldwide with its pre-sale success. Chronoly.io (CRNO) has grown by 690% during the pre-sale phase after all its CRNO tokens were sold out before the deadline. The price of CRNO went up from $0.01 to $0.079 within just 3 months of its launch, in May 2022.\par \par \uc2 Chronoly.io (CRNO) is the only platform in the world that allows people to invest fractionally in luxury timepieces. It is a digital marketplace that mints NFTs of luxury watches and allows their trading. On Chronoly.io (CRNO), investors are allowed to purchase NFTs of luxury watches for as low as $10. They can also verify the authenticity of the watch NFTs they are investing in.\par \par \uc2 To provide real-world asset backing to its NFTs and make its CRNO token immune to market fluctuations, Chronoly.io (CRNO) purchases physical luxury watches and stores them in its vaults before minting. It is a well-accepted fact that tokens that have backing from physical assets are considered more stable and profitable. It is in this context that the whitepaper of Chronoly.io (CRNO) has highlighted that the watch market can book a profit of $49 billion in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 Bulls have endorsed Chronoly.io\u8217\'20\'19s (CRNO) business roadmap, and the platform\u8217\'20\'19s CRNO token is expected to rise by another 2,500%-5,000% soon.\par \par \uc2 Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://chronoly.io/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://chronoly.io/}}}\par \par \uc2 Telegram: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/Chronolyio"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.me/Chronolyio}}}\par \par \uc2 Presale: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://presale.chronoly.io/register"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://presale.chronoly.io/register}}}\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/Chronolyio"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://twitter.com/Chronolyio}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Brave New Coin Limited \par \par \uc2 Crypto markets slide as investors move 'risk off' as more Fed interest rate hikes look increasingly likely, Ethereum Merge proceeds, and Ethereum Classic bucks the downward price trend as ETH miners turn their rigs towards ETC.\par \par \uc2 * The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has dipped by a significant ~9.2% following the release of a hotter-than-expected inflation report in the United States. The price of the asset currently trades for ~US$19,800.\par \par \uc2 * A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Tuesday report for August published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics}}}\uc2  indicated that the Consumer Price Inflation (CPI), which tracks a wide range of goods and services, rose by 0.1% month-by-month and by 8.3% for the year.\par \par \uc2 * Economists expected headline inflation to drop by 0.1% so the increase was a surprise. The CPI rate impacted optimism amongst investors that the Fed may slow down interest rate hikes because of a cooler economy. It also means that consumers continue to suffer because of high prices.\par \par \uc2 * Alongside the slide in crypto markets, stock indices also tumbled. The Dow Jones, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq composite were down by 3.9%, 4.3%, and 6.3% for the day following the CPI report. Large tech stocks like \uc2 Meta\uc2  and \uc2 NVIDIA\uc2  were amongst the biggest losers.\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/prices/btc-pearson-correlation-30d"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The correlation between the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and major US stock indices has risen in recent weeks}}}\uc2 . This suggests that both markets are being shunned by investors who have inflation concerns and are turning risk-off.\par \par \uc2 * Higher inflation rates will likely lead to higher interest rates in the United States and globally. This increases the appeal of saving and decreases the appeal of investing. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/dollar-steadies-eyes-turn-us-inflation-data-2022-09-13/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 dollar index conversely had its biggest percentage day gain since 2020}}}\uc2  following the CPI print further indicating that investors are flying to safety.\par \par \uc2 Altcoin Watch\par \par \uc2 * It has also been a difficult week for altcoin markets with investors turning risk-off and dollar strength pushing towards safer investments. Ethereum, despite the Merge upgrade which is set to occur today, is down 10.3%.\par \par \uc2 * An asset that has absorbed the bearish pressure more strongly than others is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bravenewcoin.com/data-and-charts/assets/ethereum-classic"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum Classic (ETC)}}}\uc2  which is down a comparatively mellow ~3.2% and is up ~5.4% in the last day.\par \par \uc2 * {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://2miners.com/etc-mining-pool"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 According to data from mining pool 2miners}}}\uc2 , the hashrate of Ethereum Classic is up ~200% in the last 30 days. Ethereum miners who will now be homeless following the transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake are making the move to Ethereum Classic which uses very similar software to pre-Merge Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 * During the recently concluded Ethereum Community Conference in Paris, Buterin invited the ETH community to use ETC if they prefer PoW. He called it \u8220\'20\'1Ca totally fine chain.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 What we\u8217\'20\'19re looking at: The Merge is almost upon us\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images.ctfassets.net/sdlntm3tthp6/6K0huMnL4xD6sSXWIM6NRW/181b62079f198c3d5456d543dcb14f42/bravenewcoin-vitalik-buterin-banner-min.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image.}}}\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/welcome-to-the-merge-what-happens-next"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 The Merge is almost upon us}}}\uc2 .

The shift has significant implications for the supply of the Ether token and the \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact of the Ethereum blockchain.\par \par \uc2 A common misconception is that it will make Ethereum immediately cheaper and faster. This is not the intention of the upgrade. It is a change in how the network is secured and is designed for scalability. There are no expectations from Ethereum developers that gas costs will drop straight after the Merge is implemented. More info {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/welcome-to-the-merge-what-happens-next"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 here}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The Merge will witness the joining together or \u8216\'20\'18merging\u8217\'20\'19 of the execution layer, Ethereum as we know it today, with a consensus layer called the Beacon chain.\par \par \uc2 What has many investors excited is the price implications of the Merge. The Merge is set to be a major supply shock for the Ether token. Since the network is now PoS, a chunk of ETH will be illiquid because it will be locked in high-yield native staking. There will also be a halving-type effect because PoS validator rewards are much lower than PoW miner rewards. The inflation rate of ETH is set to drop sharply. These factors combined with Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s new environmentally friendly narrative, layer-2s emerging, and the existing fee burn mechanism present bullish tailwinds for ETH.\par \par \uc2 Document BRACOI0020220915ei9f00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 Top 5 Trends Shaping Crypto Mining Future: What Awaits Miners\b0\par\par\uc2 736 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 As the Ethereum blockchain awaits the Merge and its full transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), a broader discussion about miners and their future has emerged. As things stand, the Ethereum blockchain market is incredibly fragmented. The Merge is expected to usher in a new era in which validators and coin stakers replace miners. Miners who have spent much resources on ETH mining equipment may be rendered obsolete.\par \par \uc2 Recent discussions about proof-of-work (PoW) mining and its benefits and drawbacks make it worth considering the market's future. How will mining change in the coming years, and what can miners do to prepare?\par \par \uc2 Here are a few trends that cryptocurrency miners should be aware of:\par \par \uc2 Renewable Energy Application\par \par \uc2 Although it may sound like a buzzword, the shift to renewable energy is gaining traction in the mining industry.\par \par \uc2 Mining rigs consume a significant amount of power. Large-scale mining operations employ thousands of miners at the same time. Much has already been written about the energy consumption associated with cryptocurrency mining. According to one {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://hbr.org/2021/05/how-much-energy-does-bitcoin-actually-consume"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 report}}}\uc2 , crypto mining consumes up to 110 terawatt-hours of energy per year - the same amount of energy as a small country.\par \par \uc2 Since \uc2 Tesla\uc2  stopped accepting Bitcoin payments last year, there has been a broader discussion about mining and its carbon footprint. As a result, many in the mining industry advocate for more carbon-neutral mining operations.\par \par \uc2 Indeed, one of the reasons for the Ethereum blockchain's transition to PoS is \uc2 environmental\uc2  concerns.\par \par \uc2 One of the most significant trends in the mining industry is the shift away from carbon-based power and toward renewable energy sources. This pattern will likely continue, particularly as market participants seek to disprove industry skeptics.\par \par \uc2 Miner Obsolescence\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most significant consequence of many coin developers' shifting to PoS is that miners may soon become obsolete.\par \par \uc2 It's an unpleasant truth. Many coin developers are abandoning the PoW model. Miners are becoming obsolete as a result of this shift. Stakeholders and validators have taken their place. This pattern is likely to continue in the future.\par \par \uc2 Miners will have to find new ways to stay profitable. But with mining becoming less appealing, miners' future does not look promising.\par \par \uc2 Increasing Hashrates\par \par \uc2 The hashrate measures the resources needed to conduct mining operations and secure the Bitcoin blockchain.\par \par \uc2 According to industry experts, the hashrate of the Bitcoin network will significantly increase over the next year. Chinese miners who left the space last year are expected to gradually return, moving out of the country to other countries that welcome miners. At the same time, new market entrants are expected, particularly once the market downturn has passed and coins become more profitable.\par \par \uc2 All of this means that mining difficulty will rise significantly, possibly exceeding the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 all-time high}}}\uc2  of 248.11 EH/s, set earlier this year.\par \par \uc2 Reduced Margins\par \par \uc2 Miners will most likely have difficulty logging profits from their activity as mining difficulty and hashrate rise. However, this will depend on the Bitcoin price moving consistently over time. If this occurs, rewards could be cut in half, with competition eventually eating away at the high margins that miners have enjoyed thus far.\par \par \uc2 This means businesses that can keep costs low and use the most efficient machines will survive in the long run. Smaller margins will disproportionately affect new individual miners, potentially leading to the rise of mining pools.\par \par \uc2 Chip Shortages\par \par \uc2 Finally, there is expected to be a severe shortage of chip availability in the future.\par \par \uc2 Mining rigs are built with the same semiconductor chip used to build electric cars, mobile phones, and other devices. Since 2019, demand for these semiconductor chips {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2022/01/results-semiconductor-supply-chain-request-information"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 has surged}}}\uc2  by 17%. Increased production of electric vehicles, tablets and smartphones, artificial intelligence devices, and other items has resulted in a surge in demand, and mining rigs are catching up.\par \par \uc2 Even though semiconductor manufacturers {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/business/economy/chips-semiconductors-shortage.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 reportedly produce}}}\uc2  at 90% capacity, supply has not increased to meet demand.\par \par \uc2 Because of this disparity, mining industry players cannot afford to make short-term decisions at this time. Mining companies will need to plan their operations at least a year in advance, place orders early, and wait the period out.\par \par \uc2 According to a report by the \uc2 US Department of Commerce\uc2 , the primary bottlenecks appear to be thin production capacity - which will necessitate long-term solutions. Chip shortages are expected to persist until those solutions are found.\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020220914ei9e000ul\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw40\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal600\pichgoal600

\par\par \b \uc2 The Need to Build Consumer-Centric Web3 Products\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 824 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 The crypto market is still recovering from a bearish hangover. Macroeconomic conditions, Fed news, and the crypto liquidity crisis have been pushing crypto prices to new lows. Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), for example, have fallen by more than 65% since their all-time high in November 2021. The total crypto market cap presently stands around $978 billion, dropping 68% from its peak of $3 trillion.\par \par \uc2 The impact of this downturn has also been apparent in several projects, with some shutting down owing to weaker fundamentals. TerraUSD (UST), for example, dropped from $40 billion to Zero in a matter of weeks as a result of poor token design. Even Celsius went bankrupt after a major liquidation that was not risk-hedged. This has been the case with many others that were shut down because of the current bear market.\par \par \uc2 The ultimate reasons have pointed to weak fundamentals of projects, such as poor token design, overleveraged holdings, and a flawed product offering. As a result, the need to foster a more stable market has become important. It's time to quit riding the hype train and start creating products that are truly consumer-centric.\par \par \uc2 Providing Real World Utilities for \uc2 Sustainability\par \par \uc2 Crypto bear cycles have been brutal every time they\u8217\'20\'19ve come, wiping out a number of projects from the cryptosphere. They have been a stress test for all the crypto projects. The only thing that distinguishes the test survivors are projects with strong fundamentals. Now, the term fundamentals may be ambiguous, which is understandable given that it has different meanings for each project.\par \par \uc2 Even while the fundamentals of each project differ, one primary aspect shared by strong projects is that they deliver consumer-centric solutions. Crypto projects that solve community problems with their products or tokens are the ones who survive the most severe bear markets. They are the ones that bring back the faith that has been lost in the industry and community as a whole.\par \par \uc2 Exeno is one such blockchain-based platform that is providing consumer-centric solutions. The team behind the project states that \u8220\'20\'1Cexeno started as a crypto-only online store for name brand products. We quickly discovered that the project needed deeper solutions and better tools to stay relevant. That\u8217\'20\'19s why exeno coin (EXN), our native cryptocurrency, is armed with features that make it genuinely applicable in the world of e-commerce. We\u8217\'20\'19re talking about a multi-chain coin with bridging technology.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Exeno is entirely focused on developing real-world use cases that would greatly benefit consumers. \u8220\'20\'1CWe create solutions that will make cryptocurrency a part of daily life. The period of abstract crypto projects without practical application is over\u8220\'20\'1C says CEO of exeno, Tom Babiak.\par \par \uc2 Bear Markets: An Opportunity To Build Better\par \par \uc2 Bear markets have historically spelled problems for the crypto sector. As a result, relatively few people have explored the possibility of creating something great in such markets. In reality, bear markets level the playing ground by bringing real projects to the forefront that are devoted to their vision and objective. The market limitations enable ingenuity and commitment to generate long-term beneficial improvements.\par \par \uc2 It is during these times that entrepreneurs are free to focus on developing their products, communities, and networks without being distracted. It enables project founders to focus on technological advances by identifying the greatest use cases for blockchain and crypto. Axie infinite, for example, was one of the projects created during the 2018 bear market. The Pokemon-style game found its use case in gaming, where it became a huge hit making billions of dollars.\par \par \uc2 Another example was Compound Finance, a lending platform on the ethereum blockchain. It was built during the 2017-2018 bear market, which also pioneered protocol governance, and is currently worth $3.5 billion in total value locked (TVL). There have been many other bear market hits, such as Aave and Maker, which are presently valued at $10 billion and $7 billion, respectively. All of these show that bear markets have not only been dreadful, but also brought opportunities to build better.\par \par \uc2 Enabling a Smooth Transition from Web2 to Web3\par \par \uc2 Thousands of crypto projects have been launched to date, but only a few have survived long enough. Bear markets have done their part to rid the sector of bad projects while preserving the strong ones. The crypto sector desperately needs strong projects and visionary builders to make it reach the masses. \u8220\'20\'1CWith projects like exeno creating real-world utilities to tackle community problems, it is an indication that the industry is progressing for the better. An ecosystem like this is necessary to bring communities together by solving their problems, thus making the transition from web2 to web3 easier\u8221\'20\'1D sums up Tom Babiak.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Brave New Coin Limited \par \par \uc2 With the Merge just a day away - the crypto community is buzzing due to the implications of Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s \u8216\'20\'18largest upgrade ever\u8217\'20\'19. The network\u8217\'20\'19s shift from Proof-of-Work consensus to Proof-of-Stake is more than just cosmetic. The transition to Proof of Stake is the most significant blockchain network upgrade this industry has seen to date.\par \par \uc2 The Facts\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bravenewcoin.com/data-and-charts/assets/ethereum"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum (ETH)}}}\uc2  is a decentralized blockchain technology that functions as a peer-to-peer network that executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. Ethereum was launched in 2015 and builds on the original blockchain innovations first introduced by Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Both Bitcoin and Ethereum allow users to exchange value without payment providers or banks. Ethereum, however, differs because it allows application developers to build decentralized applications. It is able to do this because it supports more complex, programmable transactions than Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Ethereum foundation\uc2  states that the Merge will be \u8216\'20\'18the most significant upgrade in the history of Ethereum.\u8217\'20\'19 The Merge will witness the joining together or \u8216\'20\'18merging\u8217\'20\'19 of the execution layer, Ethereum as we know it today, with a consensus layer called the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/ethereum-2-0-genesis-set-for-december-1st"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Beacon chain.}}}\uc2  The Beacon chain uses a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus model that will replace the current Proof-of-Work (PoW) model that the mainnet currently uses. The switch to PoS will replace energy-intensive mining, and instead secure the network with staked ETH.\par \par \uc2 The Merge upgrade officially kicked off on September 6th with the Bellatrix upgrade. As Ethereum founder {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1566993505326710785"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Vitalik Buterin explained on Twitter}}}\uc2  \u8220\'20\'1CThe Merge is still expected to happen around Sep 13-15. What's happening today is the Bellatrix hard fork, which prepares the chain for the Merge. Still important though - make sure to update your clients!\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 It is important to note that the Beacon chain was shipped separately from the Ethereum mainnet chain and the Merge. It has been running independently and parallel to other assets within the Ethereum ecosystem. The Merge is when it will integrate with other assets within the ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 The Bellatrix upgrade prepared the existing Ethereum PoS Beacon chain to Merge with the Ethereum mainnet layer. The Ethereum mainnet layer is the Ethereum that the crypto ecosystem is familiar with and has been using since 2016. When the Merge is completed in mid-September, the Beacon chain will become the official consensus layer when interacting with Ethereum and the current mainnet will become purely an execution layer.\par \par \uc2 The Bellatrix upgrade occurred at Epoch 144896 on 6th September at 11:35 UTC. Terminal Total Difficulty (TTD) represents the cumulative difficulty of all Ethereum blocks mined. TTD value triggering the Merge has been set at 58,750,000,000,000,000,000,000. This is expected to occur between the 13th-16th September. The way the transition is planned, the difficulty level of the current Ethereum PoW mainnet will increase to a point where mining new blocks will no longer be possible.\par \par \uc2 The countdown to the Merge can be tracked {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.ethernodes.org/merge"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 here.}}}\par \par \uc2 The Hype\par \par \uc2 Leading up to the Merge, ETH has rallied strongly. On Saturday, June 18th, 2022 at 12:00 UTC, the Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) ETH price was US$968.15. This marked a local bottom. While the ELX is aggregated on some exchanges the ETH price fell as low as US$880. It then pushed as high as ~US$2000 on August 14th, a jump of around 110% in two months. Since mid-August, the price of Ether has slipped to around ~US$1600.\par \par \uc2 It should be noted that in a wider context, the ETH price rise was not as idiosyncratic as many ETH bulls assumed. Over the same period, the price of BTC rose by ~29%, and the prices of \uc2 Binance\uc2  Smart Chain token (BNB), and Solana (\uc2 SOL\uc2 ), also both rose by ~51%. Additionally, the S&P500 rose by ~15% as did the Nasdaq Composite. Notable is the similar price appreciation each of these assets followed.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images.ctfassets.net/sdlntm3tthp6/56zGSj1xRkavzgccCchhAw/b33f3f6cafd30844bdc7fd5ffee5b03b/ETH1.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image.}}}\par \par \uc2 ELX 6-month price trend.

Source: \uc2 Google\uc2  Data\par \par \uc2 A number of perceived risk assets had further corrections following a strong period of selling and price drops in Q2. This included equities and crypto assets. The wider crypto market was able to recover from the mass liquidation events of Terra, Celsius, and Three Arrows Capital. Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s strong last two-month price period was not purely driven by the Merge.\par \par \uc2 Triple Tailwinds: What has ETH bulls so bullish\par \par \uc2 The Merge is creating bullish tailwinds for Ethereum and there are likely three key factors behind that surge.\par \par \uc2 The Triple Halving - The bitcoin halving is pivotal in crypto markets because of the strong positive effect it has on the price of BTC. It occurs approximately every 4 years and cuts the supply rate of new Bitcoin in half. The halving reduces the rate of inflation and like clockwork, creates upward price pressure for Bitcoin.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images.ctfassets.net/sdlntm3tthp6/3WCcDXP0HGG8dq3Hf6LZ9d/4ba69c5a7991922b98c8d048274c2a2c/ETH4.jpg"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Source: Tradingview user- BitcoinBearSlayer\par \par \uc2 Ethereum is set to undergo a similar halving type of effect with the transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). The Merge is set to cut the emission rate of Ethereum by 90%. PoS makes securing the network much cheaper than with Proof-of-Work, and because of this, PoS validators are paid far less than PoW miners. Calculations from some analysts suggest that the inflation rate cut to Ethereum will be the equivalent of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/SquishChaos/status/1387074095007817730?s=20&t=bE4ZUfRF2alJiFmj1lc8IQ"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1Cthree Bitcoin halvings\u8221\'20\'1D}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin bulls generally tout the halving as a powerful bullish tailwind and often focus on investing around this four year cycle. If Ethereum bulls are right then the PoS transition will be 12 years of halving cycles in one single event. Some analysts have suggested that Ethereum will become the \u8216\'20\'18first profitable blockchain ever\u8217\'20\'19 post halving.\par \par \uc2 The issuance rate changes for Ethereum can be {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://moneyprinter.info/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 tracked here}}}\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Illiquidity - With PoS, transaction fees from the B block are collected and then distributed as staking rewards to validators and delegators. The original proposer gets an additional reward for their service. Delegators are average ETH holders who assign their stake to a validator, who participates in staking on their behalf for a fee and offers a small share of their validator rewards.\par \par \uc2 A large amount of ETH is already locked into DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Compound, and Aave for lending and market-making rewards. The launch of new native ETH staking rewards for participating in the Beacon chain will see even more ETH locked up - and it will therefore become more illiquid.\par \par \uc2 Currently, Lido Finance offers depositors ~3.5% for delegated staking services. Noted Ethereum researcher {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/drakefjustin/status/1384124998084792324"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Justin Drake predicts, }}}\uc2 based on modeling, that ETH staking rewards will shoot up following the Merge. His expectations are that yields for ETH staking will rise to as much as ~25%, with his lowest expectation being that yield will be ~9%. The transaction load of the beacon chain is set to increase significantly.\par \par \uc2 Native yield means not having to trust a 3rd party protocol like Aave or Compound. Yield is a passive income and generates yield independent of market conditions. This may make ETH more appealing in trendless markets than other large-cap crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC).\par \par \uc2 Ethereum becomes environmentally friendly - The \uc2 Ethereum foundation\uc2  says that after the Merge Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s energy usage will decrease by ~99.95%. The Ethereum network is a decentralized, secure payment network for users seeking to send and receive money and relies on its peer-to-peer nature for its operations and cryptography. Securing the information and value stored on the network in a truly decentralized manner using PoW, it turns out, took a great deal of processing power - particularly as Ethereum grew. PoS is set to significantly lower the energy consumption and processing power required to secure the network, while at the same time maintaining decentralization.\par \par \uc2 Both PoS and PoW require the parties involved in securing the network to have \u8216\'20\'18skin-in-the-game\u8217\'20\'19.\par \par \uc2 In PoW, if a miner proposes an invalid block, the miner wastes time, energy, and money (investment in hardware). In PoS the protocol can destroy a validator's stake or ban them from participating in the protocol. With one model, participants risk wasting hardware and processing power. With the other, participants risk losing staked native coins.\par \par \uc2 In PoW, miners stake and compete with energy and hardware. Ethereum has grown to become a large powerful network that requires powerful machines with ASIC and GPU chips to efficiently mine. It may have initially been minable with just a personal PC but this is not the case anymore. With PoS, validators should always be able to perform their roles with an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/06/pos2020.html"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 unassuming laptop}}}\uc2 .\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images.ctfassets.net/sdlntm3tthp6/33iiIXtkBbohfBaSQHiTDc/58037b090b5324502ce17272fef4edb3/ETH5.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Source: The \uc2 Ethereum foundation\par \par \uc2 From an investor's perspective, this is a major narrative win for the Ethereum investment proposition.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact of Proof-of-Work blockchains is often a barrier for large investors. Corporations and entities like pension funds often have {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/esg-cryptocurrency-pros-c"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ESG mandates that conflict with a Bitcoin investment}}}\uc2  and turns them away from allocating capital towards crypto.\par \par \uc2 PoS, while less decentralized, likely passes the ESG test with a better score than PoW and may mean large investors will select Ethereum over Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Bullish factors stack together\par \par \uc2 On top of these major changes to the Ethereum blockchain, because of Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s existing free burn model introduced as part of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/podcasts/eip-1559-what-it-means-for-ethereum-users-investors-and-miners"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 London Hardfork and EIP-1559}}}\uc2 , the supply impact of the Merge is set to be even more exaggerated. The drop in daily emission rates and the supply shock will be even more pronounced.\par \par \uc2 If ETH is being burned with every transaction because of EIP-1559, a chunk of ETH is illiquid because it is locked up in high yield native staking. There will be a triple halving effect because PoS validator rewards are much lower than PoW miner rewards. It appears somewhat inevitable that the price of ETH will rise as a result of the supply shock. This is assuming that the network functions smoothly post-Merge following the transition to Proof-of-Stake.\par \par \uc2 It is a misconception that the switch to Proof-of-Stake will immediately make transactions faster and cheaper. ETH will have a supply shock and the network will consume less energy but there is no guarantee that the user experience of Ethereum will improve post-Merge.\par \par \uc2 What is more likely to improve, is the UX of Ethereum due to the burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem that is being built to make Ether faster and cheaper at scale. The AUM and transaction loads of the big-4 Ethereum layer 2\u8217\'20\'19s- Optimism, Arbitrum, ZkSync and Starknet will help with this.\par \par \uc2 Layer-2 refers to any secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain that adds features that generally improve the scaling capabilities of the base chain. One of the key advantages of layer-2 solutions is that they don\u8217\'20\'19t require any structural changes to the base layer chain.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://images.ctfassets.net/sdlntm3tthp6/1YLFsQVSdt9lcVIQXAFqD7/049d544d9a5418d35f7cbc529a207e4c/ETH6.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image.}}}\par \par \uc2 Source:L2beat.com\par \par \uc2 The total value locked into these protocols currently sits at ~US$5.1 billion. This is without any native token incentives. This growth in AUM has been organic.\par \par \uc2 None of the four layer protocols mentioned have native tokens, but they will in the future. When these tokens are launched, and there are more incentives to use the L2s, there will likely be more AUM and transaction volume.\par \par \uc2 The Beacon Chain is incomplete: Vitalik outlines improvements required\par \par \uc2 It\u8217\'20\'19s clear the public is excited about the potential price impact of the Merge, and alongwith that there is a perception that Merged Ethereum will be the height of best practise and crypto consensus perfection. Behind the scenes, though, Ethereum developers are carefully studying the architecture of the new Ethereum - and finding it lacking, or at least falling short of perfection.\par \par \uc2 In a speech in early September, for example, \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2  himself discussed at great length some of the potential flaws with the current Beacon chain model and how they may be exploited.\par \par \uc2 He says Miner Extract Value (MEV) re-orgs, while difficult to conduct with the Beacon chain\u8217\'20\'19s current Casper Proof-of-Stake model, are still possible. Buterin explains that an MEV reorg attack \u8220\'20\'1Cis basically an attack where the miner or the proposer, instead of creating a block that builds on top of the previous block, they build a block that competes with the previous block.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 He notes that with Tendermint style Proof-of-Stake consensus, which is used by the Cosmos ecosystem, it is essentially impossible to Reorg because of its single slot finality system. He suggests to \u8220\'20\'1Ctake the Ethereum Beacon chain and try to get some of these benefits by making it more Tendermint-like.\u8221\'20\'1D Buterin says there are also steps that the Beacon chain can take to negate the possibility of miners colluding to attack the network.\par \par \uc2 In addition, there is a fundamental issue with Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s PoS model. Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s consensus model is really a combination of two different consensus protocols: a "finality gadget" (called Casper FFG) that finalizes blocks after 6.4-minute-long epochs, and a "fork-choice rule" (called \u8220\'20\'1Clatest message driven greedy heaviest observed subtree\u8221\'20\'1D, \u8220\'20\'1CLMD GHOST\u8221\'20\'1D for short) that governs the chain within each epoch. Buterin is not a fan of this dual PoS consensus model.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CInstead of trying to combine together LMD ghost and FFG, and having these two very different mechanisms and trying to get them to talk to each other and agree with each other, how about we use ideas that are already well known to work, which is basically just single-slot SW finalizing consensus, right? There are plenty of papers talking about it. There are plenty of implementations of it. It's something that everyone uses, it's a very well-established and robust concept.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 As well as Buterin, Web3.0 investment firm Paradigm suggests that Ethereum should explore an alternative PoS consensus architecture.\par \par \uc2 Buterin says another goal for the Beacon chain will be to \u8220\'20\'1Cincrease the efficiency and decrease the cost of running validator nodes.\u8221\'20\'1D He says that the cost of running a node could end up being extremely high if left unchecked.\par \par \uc2 Throughout his speech, Buterin suggests potential fixes for the issues with the current version of the Beacon chain he lays out. This includes the aforementioned switch to a Tendermint style PoS.\par \par \uc2 Towards the end of his speech Vitalik suggests that Ethereum devs have always known the Merge wasn\u8217\'20\'19t to be the end of the road. \u8220\'20\'1CMaking some modifications and fine-tuning and refining the Beacon chain consensus has been something that was part of the plan since the beginning,\u8221\'20\'1D he says.\par \par \uc2 It seems that while this week\u8217\'20\'19s Merge will be a seminal event for Ethereum, its own creator acknowledges that more work will be needed to optimize the network's bold new consensus model.\par \par \uc2 This week\u8217\'20\'19s transition of Ethereum to Proof of Stake will be the most significant blockchain network upgrade this industry has seen, and probably will see for some time to come. After the Merge takes place, the conversation around Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake will only increase, especially as crypto networks increasingly integrate themselves into everyday life. However, it will likely take years for these arguments to play out in the real world.\par \par \uc2 Document BRACOI0020220914ei9e00001\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

Balance sheets are falling under stress as price remains mostly flat while hash rate and mining difficulty keep increasing.\par \par \uc2 A {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/hash-ribbons-spot-the-bitcoin-price-bottom"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 broad miner capitulation}}}\uc2  started in the beginning of the summer as the bitcoin price took a deep plunge, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-plunges-to-lowest-level-since-january-2021"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 erasing all gains made in the previous year}}}\uc2 . Pressured, most public miners who had previously committed to holding their BTC began selling their daily mined bitcoin to cover operating costs amid diminishing margins. Later, some would also start selling the BTC they had put in cold storage.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin mining is a self-regulated market where players aim to find the cheapest energy sources and most favorable jurisdictions available around the globe in an effort to shrink costs and maximize profits. As more players join the market, it becomes more difficult to mine bitcoin. As difficulty increases, miners who were operating on low margins get flushed out of the market. To maintain 10 minutes between blocks on average, the network adjusts the mining difficulty to the downside, making it a bit easier to mine bitcoin and enabling other miners to join the industry.\par \par \uc2 With hash rate now making new highs, and a bitcoin price struggling to show signs of a sustained recovery, miners are facing a challenging environment.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThe big issue for miners right now I think is that energy costs have gone up while hash rate has gone up and bitcoin prices maintained low,\u8221\'20\'1D \uc2 Fred Thiel\uc2 , CEO of Nasdaq-listed bitcoin miner \uc2 Marathon Digital Holdings\uc2 , told Bitcoin Magazine.\par \par \uc2 However, according to Thiel, not all players in the industry are hit equally. \u8220\'20\'1CThose miners who are well positioned, well capitalized and can operate from a position of strength are going to benefit from this.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Marathon, Thiel argued, is among them.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1COur models have been built around the fact that we believe that, for the balance of this year, bitcoin is going to grind along kind of where it is now, up and down a bit,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CSo, as a company, we plan around [that] scenario.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 When it comes to global hash rate pressuring higher, Thiel claimed \uc2 Marathon\uc2  is in a good position as its own growth not only cuts back on the effects of the new ATH but also contributes to that higher reading itself.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CWe\u8217\'20\'19re focused on growing our hash rate very significantly, from 3 EH [exahash] to 23 EH by mid next year,\u8221\'20\'1D he said. \u8220\'20\'1CSo we\u8217\'20\'19re actually one of the companies contributing to that growth in hash rate.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The executive forecasts that hash rate will keep trending higher throughout the year as thousands of ordered but yet-to-be-delivered machines from fellow big industry players get deployed in farms across the globe.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere were a lot of orders for miners that were publicly disclosed last year and earlier this year, so you just assume people are going to follow through with those deployments.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 The same can\u8217\'20\'19t be said for small players, however.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think the people who aren\u8217\'20\'19t following through tend to be the smaller miners, less well-capitalized. They have problem financing the purchase of the miners, or they\u8217\'20\'19re in a position where their energy costs have gone a little upside down,\u8221\'20\'1D Thiel added.\par \par \uc2 Miners enjoyed a prolonged honeymoon with profits in the past two years as a steep bull market ensued for the bitcoin price. Racketing incredible returns in dollar terms on HODLed coins, miners saw their margins balloon as bitcoin touched new highs. That reality prompted many companies to leverage up their business and take on debt to expand operations, a strategy that went south quickly as the bitcoin price started to plunge. Now, with rising hash rate, even more stress is put on these miners.\par \par \uc2 Geopolitical Tensions For The Industry Heat Up As White House Report Hints At Ban\par \par \uc2 The new high in Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s hash rate comes 18 months after the Chinese government banned bitcoin mining altogether, a move that cut the network\u8217\'20\'19s hash rate in half as local miners turned off their machines and began relocating their operations overseas. As a result, the U.S. share of global Bitcoin hash rate increased sharply as the country posed itself as one of the main destinations for the outcast businesses. Kazakhstan and Russia also welcomed the machines.\par \par \uc2 However, the U.S., which according to data from the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://ccaf.io/cbeci/mining_map"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance}}}\uc2  currently houses about 37% of Bitcoin\u8217\'20\'19s global hash rate, has itself begun to show some signs of hostility toward the industry.\par \par \uc2 Driven by energy consumption worries, the \uc2 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) \uc2 published a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 detailed report}}}\uc2  last week recommending that the Biden Administration ensure the development of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency at large in the country is accountable to concerns over \uc2 climate change\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 In its over 30 pages, the document, which is the fruit of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/biden-signs-bitcoin-executive-order-taps-cbdc"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Biden\u8217\'20\'19s executive order on digital assets}}}\uc2  from March 2022, argues that while proof-of-work mining can help the energy industry and the climate in some specific areas, its net impact to both is negative. The OSTP went as far as to recommend the administration and Congress to consider limiting or banning the use of proof of work in the U.S. altogether.\par \par \uc2 One of the positive acknowledgments made by the report relates to the usage of bitcoin mining as a baseload energy demand mechanism.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CYou\u8217\'20\'19re providing extra capacity to the grid when it\u8217\'20\'19s needed, and you\u8217\'20\'19re not really a parasitic load on the grid because you\u8217\'20\'19re behind the meter, using energy that would otherwise be wasted,\u8221\'20\'1D Thiel told Bitcoin Magazine. \u8220\'20\'1CIf you position bitcoin mining behind the meter at a renewable site, you are incentivizing more renewable production.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Thiel also highlighted that, given that it\u8217\'20\'19s midterms election year in the U.S., most of the harsh language in the report might be purely part of political plays.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CThere\u8217\'20\'19s a lot of politicking that happens and some of this is positioning by politicians,\u8221\'20\'1D he argued. \u8220\'20\'1CI personally don\u8217\'20\'19t believe that there will be a wholesale ban on proof of work.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 Though not impossible, it does appear that an eventual ban on PoW is very unlikely in the U.S. given the nature of its government compared to China\u8217\'20\'19s, as well as the extent to which bitcoin mining is integrated into power grids and communities in the country.\par \par \uc2 However, were such an event come to fruition, the network would still be prepared to withstand such an attack. The same way the network didn\u8217\'20\'19t perish when mining was banned in China \u8211\'20\'13\u8211\'20\'13 the country with the highest share of hash rate at the time \u8211\'20\'13\u8211\'20\'13 it is well positioned to show a similar outcome in a potential U.S. ban. Notwithstanding, the network might even be able to keep thriving in the U.S. during a ban, which is evidenced by the fact that there are still many machines hashing in China; according to CCAF, the Asian country still houses over 20% of the global Bitcoin hash rate.\par \par \uc2 Document BTCMAG0020220913ei9d000jh\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Opinion\par \b \uc2 Opinion: Why the Ethereum Merge will be a game-changer for DeFi?\b0\par\par\uc2 Blockchain.News Marketing \par \uc2 928 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 September 2022\par \uc2 Blockchain.News\par \uc2 BLCRNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022. Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 The upcoming Ethereum upgrade known as The Merge is creating a lot of excitement in the crypto market, and for a good reason. Wei believes it will be looked back on not just as the most important industry event of 2022, but as a major inflexion point in the history of the space.\par \par \uc2 The Merge refers to the fusion of Ethereum's Mainnet, the execution layer currently secured by an energy-intensive proof-of-work system, with the Beacon Chain, a separate consensus layer based on a proof-of-stake mechanism. Once complete, blocks of transactions will be added to the Ethereum blockchain exclusively via proof-of-stake verification, eliminating the role of miners and their heavy carbon footprint. There are many different aspects to the Merge which touch on all different parts of the crypto world, and it's only the first step in a detailed roadmap for the Ethereum described in shorthand as The Merge, the Surge, the Verge, the Purge and the Splurge . The upshot is that these changes will massively expand the Ethereum ecosystem's scalability.\par \par \uc2 Like with any big event driving the crypto narrative, there has been significant price action in ETH on many exchanges as the expected mid-September completion date of the Merge approaches. ETH holders need to understand that this is not just a turn-key upgrade, but the beginning of a long-term process. That being said, one important outcome is that there will be greater interest in Ethereum from the financial sector.\par \par \uc2 The first big reason is ESG. The shift from an energy-consuming asset to an energy-neutral one is a huge deal for institutional investors, who are more focused on ESG factors, with \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact first and foremost. Concerns over the carbon footprint of proof-of-work-based cryptocurrencies (which also notably include Bitcoin) have been one of the most important obstacles to large institutions deploying more capital in the space. The Merge means that, at least in the case of Ethereum, that particular object will be completely neutralized. Second, the nature of the proof-of-stake mechanism will significantly enhance ETH's attractiveness to large financial investors by introducing a yield-like characteristic to ETH holdings.\par \par \uc2 To understand why, you need to know a little bit about how proof-of-stake works, and how it will be implemented on the Ethereum blockchain going forward. Post-Merge, Ethereum transactions will be verified not by miners performing computations, but by validators locking up (staking) their own money (in ETH form) as collateral to ensure that they perform the verification diligently and honestly. In return, validators that successfully add blocks to the blockchain earn monetary rewards for their work. In the Ethereum context, running a validator node will require staking 32 ETH over US$50,000 at current prices although the creation of staking pools also allows smaller ETH holders to participate collectively.\par \par \uc2 This new system, therefore, creates the ability to directly and securely earn a yield on ETH holdings. This is a big deal for investors, and it could prove attractive to money managers whose main concern is generating stable returns with good upside.\par \par \uc2 Finally, ETH staking will also provide a boost to the entire decentralized finance (DeFi) space. The size and credibility of the Ethereum network will make it almost like the crypto world's equivalent of the market for US Treasuries. ETH staking will become a de facto risk-free rate for crypto, serving as an underlying rate which all sorts of DeFi yield-generating projects can be benchmarked against.\par \par \uc2 The Merge and future Ethereum upgrades, coupled with the development of Layer 2 blockchains that enable massive scaling up while inheriting the base layer ' s security guarantees, will result in a proliferation of infrastructure being built on top of the new proof-of-stake based Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 Based on the combination of all these factors, Wei is bullish on Ethereum and its ecosystem, and even more so on the DeFi space.\par \par \uc2 It ' s a great time to be building in this space , said Wei.\par \par \uc2 The Merge is about long-term value, not short-term price appreciation\par \par \uc2 A classic Wall Street maxim instructs traders to buy the rumour and sell the news. But investors should be wary of seeking short-term profit around the Merge event in September.\par \par \uc2 It is worth considering another significant crypto market event, the most recent Bitcoin halving . Every four years, the reward for mining Bitcoin is cut in half. The third instance occurred in May 2020 and was accompanied by lots of discussion about how the price would be affected. As it happened, the price of Bitcoin didn ' t change much in the run-up to the halving. Several months later, the next Bitcoin bull run got its start, powered by a narrative of Bitcoin as digital gold.\par \par \uc2 Similar dynamics could be at play with Ethereum. The Merge is not about the chance for a one-time event-driven price spike. Instead, it is about understanding the fact that it is the first in a long line of improvements that are going to upgrade the network and allow players in the ecosystem to unlock huge value by building on top of it. It will take some time for the narrative to catch up with events on the ground, and then for a meaningful inflow of capital into this asset to happen. But I am convinced that the future is bright for the ecosystem as a whole.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220913ei9d0000g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw200\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3000\pichgoal600

The latest upgrades on Walken aim to push the fast-growing gaming platform to the \u8220\'20\'1Cnext level\u8221\'20\'1D allowing users to gamify a healthier lifestyle via blockchain technology and earn crypto in the process.\par \par \uc2 Alexei Kulevets, CEO and co-founder of Walken stated the latest roadmap will make the platform \u8220\'20\'1Cmore sustainable\u8221\'20\'1D while maintaining its fun features for all gamers and users. Speaking on the unveiling of the latest roadmap and project\u8217\'20\'19s growth, Kulevets said,\par \par \uc2 "One of the main challenges of any gamified web3 project is to make it fun and sustainable, especially a free2play one. With Walken, we are proving the point that it's possible. We are grateful to our amazing community and work hard to make it even better".\par \par \uc2 Launched earlier in the year, Walken has been in constant development to achieve the vision of connecting real-world sports activities with online gaming and crypto. The gaming platform aims to give gamers an opportunity to maintain a healthy lifestyle through games and cryptocurrency. The platform provides users with gamified ways to promote healthy lifestyles by adding financial incentives making the gamers stick to their healthy routines - a new revolutionary way to promote exercising and healthy lifestyles in Web 3.\par \par \uc2 One of the top goals Walken aims for is allowing gamers to combine fun and \uc2 sustainability\uc2  while maintaining their healthy routines. As such, the platform has given rise to its own community and budding ecosystem, with thousands of users globally using the app on a daily basis. In light of the growing number of users, Walken unveiled its latest roadmap to further ensure \uc2 sustainability\uc2  and fun across the community.\par \par \uc2 First, the new roadmap includes better localisation support with seven new languages added. Secondly, the new features also include using the 60 million community-generated tokens to re-invest in Walken and bring value to the community and a ranking system that depicts a player\u8217\'20\'19s activity and achievements. It also includes an Ambassador program that will support local communities and a dedicated referral program with associated bonuses. In addition, Walken will also introduce a Wheel of Fortune to reward active players on iOS and Android apps.\par \par \uc2 Notwithstanding, Walken is also launching a game in later months featuring the CAThletes, which are the NFT characters used within the Walken ecosystem. Currently in development, the game will be launched separately with gamers allowed to boost their CAThletes by earning gems. The gems are gained by walking and can be used to upgrade the NFT characters including speed, strength, and stamina, which helps in in-game battles.\par \par \uc2 The sublime growth of the Walken app in 2022\par \par \uc2 Apart from announcing new features on their roadmap, Walken also shared some of the growth statistics that show the platform is set to have an explosive end of the year. The Android app user growth has flipped the iOS app growth since early August with 7,000 new unique daily users using the Android app while the iOS app receives slightly over 1,000 new unique daily users. The platform also received peaks of over 20,000 new daily users across July and August 2022, with Russia representing the biggest user base for Walken (19.6%), followed by Ukraine (10.4%), India (7.34%), and Vietnam (5.13%).\par \par \uc2 Finally, Walken has over 1.11 million users on the app to date, with a projection of 2 million users expected to be using the app by the end of Q4 2022.\par \par \uc2 The latest developments will enable Walken to further grow its user base and community at a rapid pace, the statement from the team reads. In the coming months, the platform will introduce staking features, enter new partnerships, and add social interaction features such as tournaments, etc. giving players a more inclusive gaming platform.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

\par\par \b \uc2 Seedify successfully launches its NFT token during the bear market.\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 593 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 On 31st August 2022, Seedify, one of the biggest launchpads within the crypto sector, released $SNFTS - the Seedify NFT Marketplace token.\par \par \uc2 Seedify is one of the crypto industry's leading notable launchpads and incubators. They empower innovators and project developers through access to funding, community and partnership building, and a complete support system to help bring premier blockchain games, NFTs, and metaverses to its community through events called IGOs (Initial Gaming offering) and INOs (Initial NFTs offering). These events attract crypto investors due to the high ROI potential that these tokens and NFTs carry.\par \par \uc2 Seedify has launched over 50 IGO projects with a proven success history and has now entered the NFT space with an NFT launchpad and marketplace that will bring a new stream of investment opportunities to its community. In addition, Seedify will focus on two verticals, blockchain Gaming and Metaverse, each with utility-based NFTs, which are imperative for \uc2 sustainability\uc2  and growth.\par \par \uc2 When $SFUND, Seedify\u8217\'20\'19s native token, was initially listed, it proved to be the best-performing free token distribution of 2021 during the bull run. These initial airdrops saw, on average, a gain of $18 000 in value and a $350 Million market cap at the 2021 market all-time high.\par \par \uc2 Once again, despite the current bear run, Seedify successfully launched their $SNFTS token via an airdrop on 31 August 2022. The results of the airdrop are as follows:\par \par \uc2 * At the time of writing this article, $SNFTS is hovering above 30x from its initial price.\par \par \uc2 * Over $6.5 Million in liquidity locked on the $SFUND/$SNFTS pair on Pancakeswap.\par \par \uc2 * Over 1000+ holders have chosen to farm or stake their $SNFTS, earning passive income. Most of them have chosen the 180 days staking pool showing confidence in the long-term performance of the token.\par \par \uc2 * $SFUND is above a $90 Million market cap, 10x above the closest gaming launchpad.\par \par \uc2 Staking and farming opportunities:\par \par \uc2 Through cultivating farming rewards and high liquidity on $SFUND - $SNFTS pairs, Seedify\u8217\'20\'19s goals are to gain higher volumes for both coins, entrench themselves within the ecosystem, unlock shared utilities and ensure mutual growth between the tokens.\par \par \uc2 $SNFTS staking and farming pools were made available straight after the airdrop. Once the holder claimed their $SNFTS, they could stake and farm and immediately start earning passive income. The staking pools are as follows :\par \par \uc2 * 14 Days \u8212\'20\'14 7% APY\par \par \uc2 * 30 Days \u8212\'20\'14 10% APY\par \par \uc2 * 60 Days \u8212\'20\'14 20% APY\par \par \uc2 * 90 Days \u8212\'20\'14 30% APY\par \par \uc2 * 180 Days \u8212\'20\'14 40% APY\par \par \uc2 Holders are also entitled to additional benefits of $SNFTS, such as fee reduction and random NFT drops for those trading in the upcoming Seedify NFT marketplace.\par \par \uc2 They will also be eligible for whitelist spots for Seedify\u8217\'20\'19s upcoming and exclusive Avatar NFT collection, which has recently been announced.\par \par \uc2 $SNFTS Tokenomics:\par \par \uc2 * Total Supply: 20 Billion\par \par \uc2 * Initial MCap: 446,000\par \par \uc2 * SNFTS Listing Price: $0.0004 BUSD\par \par \uc2 * Circulating Supply: 1.166 Billion\par \par \uc2 * Network: BSC\par \par \uc2 * Exchange: Pancakeswap\par \par \uc2 * Vesting plan (for the airdrop): 25% at TGE and 25% every month for three months\par \par \uc2 Seedify will continue to push the boundaries and expand its ecosystem to ensure they present the best quality projects with the highest opportunities for return to its community and holders.\par \par \uc2 To learn more about Seedify, please refer to the following links:\par \par \uc2 * Website\par \par \uc2 * \uc2 Twitter\par \par \uc2 * Telegram announcement\par \par \uc2 * Telegram chat\par \par \uc2 * Medium\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

It also looked at whether there are any reforms that the government would need to implement to improve the cryptocurrency market\u8217\'20\'19s impact on the environment.\par \par \uc2 On one of the pages of the report, the White House ranked all the cryptocurrencies by market valuation and energy consumption.

As expected, Cardano soon garnered a lot of support on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , with many stating that this is a bullish sign for $ADA.\par \par \uc2 For instance, Dan Gambardello, Founder of Crypto Capital Venture, tweeted \u8211\'20\'13\par \par \uc2 Here is the White House energy report showcasing {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cardano?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 #Cardano}}}\uc2  as the largest proof of stake blockchain in the world.

Even though there was a dip in volume recently, trading volume soon climbed from $732.33 million to $763.21million.\par \par \uc2 Furthermore, the MVRV ratio has also been climbing steadily, with the same being another indicator of a bullish future.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statics.ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-1.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image}}}\par \par \uc2 Source: Santiment\par \par \uc2 Here, it\u8217\'20\'19s worth noting that there has been a sharp decline in developer activity.

The crypto\u8217\'20\'19s price has been trading between the resistance of $0.519 and the support of $0.431 of late. The RSI had a reading of 65.54, with the same being a good indicator that the momentum is with the buyers at the moment. With the altcoin\u8217\'20\'19s price testing the $0.51 resistance, the future seemed very bullish for ADA on the charts.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the CMF was at 0.08. Now, although this seemed to be a slightly bullish reading, it isn\u8217\'20\'19t a strong enough indicator of a bullish future for ADA.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://statics.ambcrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-3.png"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Click to view image}}}\par \par \uc2 Source: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ADAUSD/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 ADA/USD}}}\uc2 , TradingView\par \par \uc2 Hence, traders are advised to do more research before getting into any position.

\par\par \b \uc2 At Underground Citadel, Bitcoiners Learned How To Build Sovereign Lives\b0\par\par\uc2 1,355 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 September 2022\par \uc2 Bitcoin Magazine\par \uc2 BTCMAG\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Bitcoin Magazine, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 On August 25, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://planbpassport.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Plan B Passport}}}\uc2  hosted {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://theundergroundcitadel.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 the fifth Underground Citadel}}}\uc2  at Bitcoin Commons in Austin, Texas. If you didn\u8217\'20\'19t get to attend the highest-signal event of the year, this article is for you. It had the highest attendee count and retention rate we have ever seen \u8212\'20\'14 the Bitcoin Commons/Austin Bitcoin community event space was full from start to finish, and even beyond the end of the event.\par \par \uc2 Underground Citadel is designed as the best place for Bitcoiners to connect with like-minded people where they can build their own tribes. Here\u8217\'20\'19s a little background on how this event came to fruition:\par \par \uc2 Building The Underground Citadel\par \par \uc2 We\u8217\'20\'19ve all been there: you get orange pilled and you learn about a fraudulent monetary system. Then, you start to question all of the other things that you were lied to about. You enter a stage where you go down all different kinds of rabbit holes while also wanting everything to burn to the ground. But, once you get past this anger stage, you find that life can still be beautiful and you focus on creating the life that you desire.\par \par \uc2 The Underground Citadel is the conference where we discuss the solutions that help us build the life we deserve outside of the faulty system that we are currently in. We invite attendees to come and find the signal that stems from Bitcoin and learn how they can create that beautiful life.\par \par \uc2 Finding The Beautiful Life\par \par \uc2 For this edition of Underground Citadel, we started with the foundation, the basics, physical security and the derivatives of that \u8212\'20\'14 situational awareness, mental tactics and threat recognition. How to heighten your ability to be aware of your surroundings and how to counteract any potential threats.\par \par \uc2 We went into depth on the ultimate sovereign individual toolset, including survival instinct, deterrence/preemptive strikes, deception, evacuation, extreme focus and awareness, reality-based training, and perhaps integrating some medical training. In any dangerous situation, you want to create the mental model of appearing \u8220\'20\'1Cbig and strong\u8221\'20\'1D in order to deter any potential threats and be in the habit of \u8220\'20\'1Cbreaking your routine.\u8221\'20\'1D\par \par \uc2 We then segued into hunting. Some might say we\u8217\'20\'19ve even regressed as a society, since most people nowadays can\u8217\'20\'19t provide food themselves other than going to a grocery store, farmers market, etc. We explored the ins and outs of why we should hunt, what kills you should learn and why paying attention is one of the most important skills you can attain. Funnily enough, presenter Jon Wayne Taylor actually went on to explain how hunting is inefficient in comparison to domestication, farming and trapping. This is the case until, of course, you\u8217\'20\'19re left with no other options. He later went on to explain why one should learn tracking, trailing, marksmanship and butchery skills in order to further your hunting knowledge.\par \par \uc2 Afterwards, we went on to home birth. This topic seemed to be the most mind blowing for Bitcoiners. We\u8217\'20\'19ve had this topic in mind since the first Underground Citadel event, but weren\u8217\'20\'19t sure how the male-dominated audience would react. We really appreciate the way Bitcoiners welcomed this talk.\par \par \uc2 We discussed why we moved toward not trusting our bodies to do one of the main things it was built to do. Why have we allowed the medical system to take over and numb women during childbirth? As Bitcoinersm we preach \u8220\'20\'1Cdon\u8217\'20\'19t trust, verify,\u8221\'20\'1D so people should be doing their own research as to why they will or will not have a baby in a hospital and educate themselves on what is best for their scenario, but not allow doctors to scare them into having this beautiful experience under fluorescent lights in a stress-inducing environment. In the healthcare system, you are the consumer and you are the one who should have the power.\par \par \uc2 We then, of course, had to dive into flag theory and jurisdictional arbitrage. At this Underground Citadel, we dove into how Bitcoin actually enables freedom of movement and as a group of people who value permissionless money, we should also value permissionless movement. As of now, we are born into a nonconsensual monopoly and in a fiat world, we are unable to keep governments accountable. The money printer and greedy \u8220\'20\'1Cleaders\u8221\'20\'1D are what control the world. However, under a Bitcoin standard, the people become the customers and governments are forced to compete with each other through providing the best services for the best prices.\par \par \uc2 But, until then, this is exactly why we focus on \u8220\'20\'1Cinvestment migration,\u8221\'20\'1D the term we use in the jurisdictional arbitrage industry to describe the immigration programs that involve investment or donation as a basis for acquiring a visa, residency or a passport. This is why we encourage people to implement jurisdictional arbitrage or flag theory into their lives. At Plan B Passport, we define \u8220\'20\'1Cflag theory\u8221\'20\'1D as a concept of limiting your dependency on any one particular state by \u8220\'20\'1Cstacking flags\u8221\'20\'1D in jurisdictions that are beneficial for you in various ways. We like to apply a markets and capitalism lense onto the way governments currently operate and show how Bitcoin brought the jurisdictional arbitrage game to another level, which actually solves the lack of a free market between nation states.\par \par \uc2 We then had our very own functional medicine expert, Dr. Oubre, go over how to take charge of your health by unlocking your \u8220\'20\'1Cdiscomfort\u8221\'20\'1D genome. I\u8217\'20\'19m sure a lot of us have done some pretty restrictive diets trying to get in the best health when we could\u8217\'20\'19ve instead figured out what we were missing from some tests and figured out what our bodies needed. He went over the five pillars of health: biological, mycotoxins, \uc2 environmental\uc2  (manmade), heavy metals and emotional, and went on to explain why you should test for each pillar. Biohacking after healing is much easier than before healing. Once optimized, you can then focus on reverse aging by unlocking your \u8220\'20\'1Cdiscomfort\u8221\'20\'1D genome.\par \par \uc2 Last but not least, we had the quick-start guide to 3D printing your sovereignty. Just like with hunting, for example tracking, killing, and processing an animal is not your first choice when it comes to putting food on the table as it\u8217\'20\'19s pretty inefficient, the same goes for 3D printing, It is an unreliable source of weapons, there\u8217\'20\'19s a steep learning curve, plus going out and purchasing your weapons is much more efficient. However, it\u8217\'20\'19s not something you need until you do, and at that point, it\u8217\'20\'19s too late. When you don\u8217\'20\'19t have easy access to water, you get a water softener, water filter, water delivery, etc. But, you\u8217\'20\'19d only be doing this when you don\u8217\'20\'19t have access to water. What happens when you don\u8217\'20\'19t have access to water and also don\u8217\'20\'19t have a solution? The same applies to 3D printing. When guns are no longer on the table, you want to know how to print them.\par \par \uc2 You don\u8217\'20\'19t need a passport when everything is fine and dandy but you also don\u8217\'20\'19t need some cyberspace money and censorship-resistant way of exchanging value until fiat currencies go to zero and you lose all of your wealth. You don\u8217\'20\'19t need a second means of a travel document until your original way of travel is no longer of use and at this point, again, it\u8217\'20\'19s too late. As sovereign individuals who are considered \u8220\'20\'1Cpreppers,\u8221\'20\'1D everything shared at Underground Citadel was definitely a step outside of our comfort zones, just as any other form of growth is uncomfortable. So our message to you all in regards to everything we covered is: It\u8217\'20\'19s not easy, but it\u8217\'20\'19s definitely worth it.\par \par \uc2 Luckily, for those of you who were unable to attend, we recorded the speakers and their presentations.

Our institutional grade staking services offer a comprehensive and fully integrated platform for earning rewards from investments across a range of leading PoS crypto networks.

\par\par \b \uc2 White House Fears Crypto Mining Threatens \uc2 Climate Change\uc2  Efforts\b0\par\par\uc2 Jana Serfontein \par \uc2 525 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 The \uc2 White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\uc2  today issued a report that highlights the negative effects of cryptocurrency production.\par \par \uc2 The report has expressed concern that the mining of cryptocurrencies may have a negative effect on the environment, which might thwart the efforts by the United States to address \uc2 climate change\uc2 . The Biden administration has been involved in a heated debate over the carbon footprint of virtual assets. Critics have for some time now been raising concern over the amount of power used in crypto mining operations. Although it did not propose any specific rules, the report did, however, suggest that the U.S. must take measures to reduce emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining. The White House report also said that the federal government should collect data on electricity usage and collaborate with states and the cryptocurrency sector to establish guidelines.\par \par \uc2 Depending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals, the report said.\par \par \uc2 Government institutions such as the \uc2 Environmental\uc2  Protection Agency\uc2  \u8220\'20\'1Cshould provide technical assistance and initiate a collaborative process with states, communities, the crypto-asset industry, and others to develop effective, evidence-based \uc2 environmental\uc2  performance standards for the responsible design, development, and use of environmentally responsible crypto-asset technologies,\u8221\'20\'1D the White House suggests.\par \par \uc2 The report further states:\par \par \uc2 Should these measures prove ineffective at reducing impacts, the Administration should explore executive actions, and Congress might consider legislation, to limit or eliminate the use of high energy intensity consensus mechanisms for crypto-asset mining.\par \par \uc2 Proof-of-Work Continues Despite Energy Concerns\par \par \uc2 According to statistics cited by the White House report, the U.S. is responsible for 38% of the world\u8217\'20\'19s Bitcoin mining, compared with 3.5% in 2020. Additionally, blockchains that support crypto assets now use up more energy than many countries, including Argentina and Australia. Crypto asset operations use between 0.9 and 1.7% of the U.S.\u8217\'20\'19s total electricity consumption.\par \par \uc2 Although the report includes cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and other tokens using blockchain technologies, the report made specific reference to one particular technology that is driving most of the energy consumption issues: the proof-of-work consensus mechanism which underpins the two largest cryptocurrency networks: Bitcoin and Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 Proof-of-work uses most of the energy that the crypto sector consumes. Fortunately, there are newer blockchains that have found different methods that use a fraction of the energy compared to Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ethereum is however taking responsibility for its carbon footprint and is expected to switch over to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism later this month. The highly anticipated Merge is supposed to cut Ethereum\u8217\'20\'19s energy consumption by up to 99.95%.\par \par \uc2 But as long as Bitcoin continues with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, and continues to be the dominant cryptocurrency, crypto mining could continue to pose problems for energy consumption.\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

\par\par \b \uc2 Top analyst predicts Flasko (FLSK) to be the best investment in 2022 and will overtake Dogecoin (DOGE) and Fantom (FTM)\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 667 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Over the past few months, the price of cryptocurrencies has steadily fallen. It has made some people worry and sell their tokens and coins. Some think this is just a brief slump and that the market will soon recover.\par \par \uc2 Top analysts forecast that Flasko (FLSK) will surpass Dogecoin (DOGE) and Fantom (FTM) as the most significant investment in 2022, giving investors a chance to restore their faith in the cryptocurrency sector.\par \par \uc2 Dogecoin (DOGE) investors rush to buy into the Flasko presale\par \par \uc2 Dogecoin (DOGE) has continued its reign as king of the meme coins. In addition to significant gains made over the last few years the well-known meme coin is likely to make another surge, however Dogecoin (DOGE) is not expected to do so until mid 2023. Dogecoin (DOGE) is still up more than 9% daily, even if trading for the currency has slowed down. According to information from CoinMarketCap, Dogecoin (DOGE) has increased dramatically since its inception.\par \par \uc2 From research, over 2.37 million investors of Dogecoin (DOGE) holders are now in the black due to that price change. These successful investors have amassed a total investment of $8.13 billion in Dogecoin (DOGE), which currently has a market cap of over $11.6 billion. Dogecoin (DOGE) investors have begun buying into the newly released Flasko (FLSK) presale.\par \par \uc2 Fantom (FTM) likely to trade sideways for the rest of 2022\par \par \uc2 Fantom (FTM) is a cryptocurrency that addresses \uc2 sustainability\uc2  and transaction speed difficulties. Its goal is to create quick, affordable and scalable alternatives for blockchain transactions. While Fantom (FTM) is still developing, it can become a crucial participant in cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 Virtual currencies have been in an adverse market for the last season, but we feel they have significant long-term possibilities. While there are dangers connected with investing in any cryptocurrency, we feel Fantom (FTM) has strong growth potential. Fantom (FTM) investors are unlikely to see any large gains until mid 2023 which is why Fantom (FTM) holders are looking at alternative investments in the meantime.\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) likely to be the best investment this year\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) is creating a marketplace where users can buy, trade and invest in NFT\u8217\'20\'19s which are backed against the physical asset. Flasko (FLSK) will be focusing on rare, exclusive and vintage bottles of alcohol, which over time have shown a significant rise in price. Users will have the option to fractionally or solely invest in an NFT, where a user who purchases 100% of the NFT will be able to take physical delivery of the goods which is stored in a secure facility. These facilities will be audited to ensure the stock is correctly accounted for on a regular basis.\par \par \uc2 Flasko (FLSK) launched stage one of its presale where the price is currently trading at $0.015. The community has been growing organically and fast, having just launched less than a week ago and already selling over 20% of stage one allocation. The token price will increase within the next 24 hours. Top crypto analysts have recently predicted a rise of over 4,000% by the end of December, making it likely to be amongst the top crypto investments in 2022.\par \par \uc2 Liquidity will be locked for 33 years, the token has passed its smart contract audit and the team will be unable to sell any tokens for the first two years. Flasko (FLSK) will create many millionaires for early presale investors. We think this is one of the best investments of the year.

\par\par \b \uc2 Ethereum Merge Could Trigger Surge of interest in Staking and Entice Institutional Buyers\b0\par\par\uc2 506 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 September 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Ethereum is in the final stages of preparations to switch from a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS). This event, which is referred to as the Merge, is expected to have several benefits for Ether (ETH) - the native token of the Ethereum blockchain.\par \par \uc2 According to a \uc2 Chainalysis{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/ethereum-merge/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 report}}}\uc2 , one of these benefits is that the Merge could trigger renewed interest in Ether (ETH) staking. This builds up on the fact that ETH staking is already highly popular. Over USD 30bn worth of ETH is already staked in Ethereum 2, making it the biggest blockchain by staked volume even before moving to PoS.\par \par \uc2 When PoS is introduced fully, staking is expected to become more attractive as users across the entire Ethereum ecosystem become more comfortable with leaving PoW behind and embracing the more environmentally friendly PoS.\par \par \uc2 Additionally, upgrades expected after the merge will enable stakers to withdraw their staked ETH at will as opposed to having to lock up their assets. This, in addition to an expected APY of 10-15%, will mean more liquidity for stakers.\par \par \uc2 These prospects, especially the \uc2 climate impact\uc2  reduction and anticipated return on investment from staking, are also expected to attract institutional investors according to the blockchain analytics services provider. On-chain data already indicates that institutional buyers (wallets staking more than $1 million worth of ETH) have been increasing steadily.\par \par \uc2 "Taken together, these changes, starting with The Merge, should make Ether a more attractive asset to hold, and therefore to stake as well\u8230\'20\'26 In addition to increased staking overall, we\u8217\'20\'19ll also be on the lookout for institutional investors specifically to begin or ramp up their Ethereum staking activity," the report said.\par \par \uc2 Risks remain for Ether post-merge\par \par \uc2 While these benefits are expected, the crypto community is also wary of the risks that the Merge could throw up for ETH. The possibility of a miners' rebellion that could lead to a split of the Ethereum blockchain, as well as the fact that dApps that hold more than $50 billion in users' funds could be in danger if the merge goes wrong are some of the risks that have been talked off.\par \par \uc2 However, Joe Lubin, a co-founder of Ethereum and the founder of the blockchain company Consensys, has downplayed these risks. Speaking with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://time.com/6211294/ethereum-merge-preview/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Time}}}\uc2 , Lubin said that even if a hardfork happens it will only be temporary and that he expects the upgrade to go through without a glitch.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CI think at least a temporary fork is likely: there\u8217\'20\'19s an opportunity to make a quick Ether, and there are a lot of opportunists out there. But I can\u8217\'20\'19t imagine wanting to build anything, or put anything of significant value, on a chain that has so many things that are fundamentally broken and abandoned," Lubin told the magazine.\par \par \uc2 The merge, which has kicked off with the Bellatrix upgrade, is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.blocknative.com/ethereum-merge-countdown"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 expected}}}\uc2  to be fully complete between September 13 and September 15, 2022.\par \par \uc2 Document CRPTNW0020220908ei98000dy\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw219\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal3285\pichgoal600

The report also claims that bitcoin miners will raise the average electricity cost for local consumers.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1CDepending on the energy intensity of the technology used, crypto-assets could hinder broader efforts to achieve net-zero carbon pollution consistent with U.S. climate commitments and goals,\u8221\'20\'1D reads the report.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the last section concludes that there are ways in which bitcoin mining can actually benefit U.S. climate goals, although this is a much smaller section.\par \par \uc2 \u8220\'20\'1C[Proof-of-work] mining that installs equipment to use vented methane to generate electricity for operations is more likely to help rather than hinder U.S. climate objectives,\u8221\'20\'1D per the report.\par \par \uc2 However, it is worth mentioning, of the cited resources used in this report, many are {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://bitcoinmagazine.com/business/bitcoin-energy-per-transaction-metric-is-misleading"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 debated}}}\uc2  and some of the researchers have received criticism for extreme bias or misinformation.\par \par \uc2 Document BTCMAG0020220908ei980005l\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw300\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4500\pichgoal600

Furthermore, corporates looking for low-risk investments will also show more interest in relatively less volatile virtual assets.\par \par \uc2 The KMPG report further predicted that companies from cryptocurrency and other industries are coming together to address \uc2 environmental\uc2 , social, and governance (ESG) concerns. This means that as more conglomerates enter the crypto industry, ESG concerns will become even more critical.\par \par \uc2 Resilience of the crypto industry to be tested\par \par \uc2 Alexandre Stachtchenko, Director, Blockchain and Crypto Assets, KPMG France voiced his views as well.\par \par \uc2 According to him, some cryptos would witness a drop in their valuations.\par \par \uc2 The report concludes by stating that cryptocurrency organizations with sound risk- and cost-management strategies will survive the slowdown.

\par\par \b \uc2 Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Hashrate goes Parabolic, Price to Follow?\b0\par\par\uc2 1,041 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 September 2022\par \uc2 Cryptonews.com\par \uc2 CRPTNW\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, Cryptonews.com, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 Ethereum Classic has arisen as an unforeseen champ ahead of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://cryptonews.com/news/eth-is-best-top-10-performer-as-first-stage-of-merge-confirmed-its-obviously-a-very-tradable-event.htm"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 Ethereum's Merge}}}\uc2 , planned for later this month. ETC coins are rising in value despite a generally flat market amid network metrics reaching all-time highs.\par \par \uc2 After a meteoric rise of almost 133% since the month of July, the Ethereum Classic hashrate surpassed the previous record of 28 TH/s set in April, as of Tuesday morning. The capacity of a computer or mining device can be measured in terahashes. Due to the increased difficulty and expense of gaining network control, a high hashrate is regarded a security indication.\par \par \uc2 Over the past seven days, Ethereum Classic tokens have gained 2.43%, reaching a high of $42.07 before paring back some of those gains. During the same period, futures contracts based on the tokens saw $27 million in liquidations, second only to ether and to surpass bitcoin futures, which typically see the greatest liquidations.\par \par \uc2 What Triggered a Sudden Surge in Price?\par \par \uc2 As a result of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/30/coindesk-live-recap-the-dao-hack-is-still-a-mystery/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 DAO attack in 2016}}}\uc2 , a hard network fork occurred, resulting in the creation of Ethereum Classic and Ethereum. Ethereum Classic is a continuation of the previous chain, while Ethereum is the newer chain.\par \par \uc2 The wealth locked up on Ethereum's different applications reached $110 billion at its peak in 2021, making it the most widely used blockchain in the world. Conversely, Ethereum Classic's development slowed to a crawl.\par \par \uc2 While the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) industry has grown exponentially, applications built on this chain have only ever secured a little over $1 million at their peak.\par \par \uc2 Though the price of ETC did increase by a factor of ten over two months during the 2021 bull market, this was due more to the speculative mania that engulfed the cryptocurrency market at the time than to any actual increase in demand.\par \par \uc2 If the bull market fails to spark change, Merge is doing the job for it.\par \par \uc2 Key network participants have shifted their attention to Ethereum Classic due to The Merge, which will change Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus process to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.\par \par \uc2 The developers believe that abandoning the proof-of-work approach will result in significant cost savings, increased network speed, and less \uc2 environmental\uc2  impact. Ethereum miners, who are paid in ether tokens for contributing to the blockchain, will also lose their source of revenue.\par \par \uc2 Quick Update on Ethereum Merge\par \par \uc2 According to the Ethereum platform, Ethereum, the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, will undergo a massive revolution that will alter its technology and reduce carbon emissions by more than 98%. The "Merge" will improve Ethereum's blockchain technology by moving it away from the more energy-intensive architecture used by its competitor, Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 However, the price of Ethereum's token, Ether (ETH), has risen dramatically in the last two months as a result of the anticipated impact of the change. The first phase of the Merge upgrade will take place on September 6, according to the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2 , and the second phase will occur between September 10 and September 20.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum will move away from the proof-of-work (PoW) paradigm, which consumes much energy, and toward the proof-of-stake (PoS) model. Despite their differences, both systems are used to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain.\par \par {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.euronews.com/next/amp/2022/09/05/the-ethereum-merge-has-big-implications-for-crypto-mining-and-bitcoin-what-to-know"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 According to Alex de Vries}}}\uc2 , an economist who runs the Digiconomist website, the migration to PoS is a step in the right direction for \uc2 sustainability\uc2 . He estimates that the energy required to mine Ethereum consumes approximately 72 terawatt-hours per year, comparable to Switzerland's carbon footprint. De Vries claims to be attempting to calculate the amount of energy saved by the switch.\par \par \uc2 He believes it is at least 99 percent right now. As a result, the "Merge" will have a significant positive impact on ETH prices in the coming days. Key network participants have shifted their attention to Ethereum Classic due to The Merge, which will change Ethereum's existing proof-of-work (PoW) consensus process to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum Classic Price Prediction: Technical Outlook\par \par \uc2 Despite a significant price increase, ETC has surrendered the majority of its gains and is now trading at $33.99. On the downside, the ETC/USD pair is likely to find immediate support at $33.25; a break below this level may extend the selling trend until the next support level of $31.55.\par \par \uc2 The leading technical indicators, such as the RSI and MACD, are now in the oversold zone, indicating that sellers are exhausted and bulls may enter the market. At the same time, the 50-day moving average is likely to support ETC at $33.50.\par \par \uc2 Finally, the Doji candle on the 4-hour timeframe has the potential to cause a market bounce. On the upside, ETC faces immediate resistance at $35.50 and $36.65.\par \par \uc2 A bullish breakout of this level, on the other hand, could expose ETC to levels as high as 37.85 and 39.35. Consider buying above $33.50 and selling below $33.50.

\par\par \b \uc2 INVEST NOW IN LYNQYO TO GET ENORMOUS PROFITS\b0\par\par\uc2 Crypto Daily \par \uc2 1,404 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 September 2022\par \uc2 CryptoDaily\par \uc2 CRPTOD\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 \u169\'00\'A9 2022, CryptoDaily, All rights Reserved - Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc. \par \par \uc2 THE TOKEN IS READY TO DOMINATE PROMINENT CRYPTOCURRENCIES LIKE DECENTRALAND AND CRONOS\par \par \uc2 Introduction\par \par \uc2 Real estate, the stock market, and other investments are now too conventional and old-fashioned. Generation Z is currently looking for different respectable and quick ways to earn. The internet has millions of opportunities for you to start earning. One of the quickest ways to earn is by investing in cryptocurrency; yes, by quickest, we mean as quick as within a day. Sounds interesting and unreal? Well, you must try your luck to see if it is true. Trading cryptocurrencies has made several individuals fortunes.\par \par \uc2 It was once widely assumed that you could earn quick money using cryptocurrencies. The market lured a significant number of investors, and young people had an easy choice. The cryptocurrency market had its best year in 2021, with a total value of more than $2 trillion. However, the bitcoin market has underperformed this year. However, many people are reconsidering investing in the collapsing market due to the current bitcoin market crisis. These failures ruined billions of dollars in investor assets, prompting strong calls for regulation of the unregulated sector.\par \par \uc2 Introducing Lynqyo (LNQ) Token\par \par \uc2 Lynqyo (LNQ) is a new initiative that is still in its premature stage. While it is not the same as Bitcoin in terms of the overall project, it has taken inspiration from Bitcoin in terms of aiming for the same degree of success. Lynqyo (LNQ) intends to revolutionize society by applying the notion of Web3 and incorporating DAOs, much as Bitcoin changed the whole banking industry. Lynqyo was developed by a team of innovators, designers, and engineers. They are working on decentralized decision-making systems that compensate producers and fans in open tokenized markets.\par \par \uc2 The Material Economy System, commonly known as the Lynqyo (LNQ) protocol, is a decentralized system for discovering, analyzing, licensing, and distributing non-physical information. It is designed to use DeFi instruments to tokenize intangible material, governance, micro-DAO, and liquidity. DAO is an acronym that stands for "decentralized autonomous organization." A DAO runs according to predetermined rules when implemented as a smart contract on a public blockchain rather than managed by business executives. DAOs are decentralized organizations with all organizational regulations imposed by blockchain-based code.\par \par \uc2 LNQ dApp\par \par \uc2 The lynqyo dApp has a one-of-a-kind mechanism that ensures continuity and \uc2 sustainability\uc2  in the crypto payments subscription industry, with two structural payment alternatives. The first approach, "push subscription," necessitates linking the user's wallet to the lynqyo dApp wallet.\par \par \uc2 For each subscription, a smart contract will be executed. A precursory letter will be made before each due date to ensure that the authorization procedure is completed and full involvement is maintained. Customers can also choose "subscription staking," which uses a proprietary algorithm to lower subscription expenses. When a user's subscription expires, they may be entitled to monetary compensation.\par \par \uc2 Content Economy Protocol\par \par \uc2 Lynqyo (LNQ) employs protocols and techniques that enhance network value. Lynqyo Content Economy Protocol is one of these, and it is responsible for empowering users and releasing the creativity of producers all around the world.\par \par \uc2 This economic protocol monetizes non-physical content and generates money from LNQ tokens. Therefore, it will be possible to identify, evaluate, license, and share intangible material. The content economy protocol will enable governance via a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), content tokenization via user loyalty rewards, and liquidity via DeFi tools.\par \par \uc2 How to Buy Lynqyo (LNQ)?\par \par \uc2 Are you looking forward to purchasing the new Lynqyo (LNQ)? We'll discuss how to buy Lynqyo (LNQ) if you're here. Purchasing LNQ is straightforward. First, you must create an account on Lynqyo, just like on any other website (LNQ). You can select your preferred payment method from the two options offered. Purchasing LNQ tokens through \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  gives you six alternatives. You can pay with any of the six cryptos: BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH, DAI, or USDC. You can choose your wallet at your own will for the transactions.\par \par \uc2 The second method is to use cryptocurrencies. This allows you to buy $LNQ tokens in exchange for various cryptocurrencies, including those with minimal transaction fees. Following your currency decision, you will be sent to the appropriate site where funds should be delivered to complete your transaction.\par \par \uc2 Decentraland (MANA)\par \par \uc2 Decentraland is an Ethereum-based platform for 3D virtual worlds (MANA). It contains customizable features such as land, art, and activities. Users of Decentraland (MANA), a virtual reality platform, may buy and sell real estate while playing games and interacting with others. MANA is a form of digital money that can be used to purchase goods and services.\par \par \uc2 It is a virtual platform that allows users to design, test, and commercialize the software. The user base now has complete influence over the goods and designs. It provides a more practical and cost-effective alternative to the virtual platform. The expense of doing so via an offline network would be prohibitively expensive. MANA is an ERC-20 token that may be used to conduct transactions inside the Decentraland (MANA) ecosystem for nearly no gas expenses. Its holders can vote on any modifications made to the virtual environment of Decentraland (MANA).\par \par \uc2 MANA can be purchased on over a hundred exchanges, including OKEx and \uc2 Binance\uc2 . It may also be exchanged for Ethereum (ETH) and other major or stablecoins and bought with other fiat currencies. As of 2nd September 2022, the Decentraland (MANA) is worth $0.7456. According to CoinMaketCap, the currency is 36th, with a total market worth of $1.48 billion. It dropped by 3.14 percent in the past 24 hours and 8.73 percent in the previous week.\par \par \uc2 Cronos (CRO)\par \par \uc2 Cronos is another DeFi-compliant smart chain. It is the first Ethereum-compatible blockchain network built on the Cosmos SDK and Ethermint. It is an open-source, permission-free layer one chain planning to expand the network without limits. Cronos (CRO) aims to expand DeFi, GameFi, and expansive Web3 user groups. With a total quantity of 30 billion, CRO is in its present stage, giving it a scarcity element. The majority of this, over 25 billion, is in service. The remaining supply has been set aside for scattering staking rewards and ecosystem growth. Cronos (CRO) is a one-stop shop for buying and selling cryptocurrency, staking and earning cryptocurrency, storing all of your cryptocurrency in one wallet, and much more. This helps developers quickly move apps and monetary assets from other chains while also benefiting from cheaper transaction costs, better throughput, and speedier finality.\par \par \uc2 Cronos (CRO) is a decentralized cryptocurrency that enables investors to track their funds and protect their identities. Crypto also gives its customers personal control over their money while protecting their identities. Cronos (CRO) allows users to purchase assets, art, avatars, and real estate. The digital marketplace is hot right now, thanks to the Metaverse's popularity and profitability. According to CoinMarketCap, as of 2nd September 2022, Cronos (CRO) decreased more than 5.75% in the last seven days, trading at $0.1219 per coin. Over the previous 24 hours, the coin decreased by 2.03%. With a coin capitalization of $3.07 billion, the coin is ranked 26th.\par \par \uc2 Conclusion\par \par \uc2 Lynqyo (LNQ) is a native crypto token used in all of the ecosystem's key transactions. The project will run mainly on the Polygon blockchain, but it will eventually collaborate with the other two blockchains, Polkadot (DOT) and Ethereum (ETH). Lynqyo (LNQ) is poised for success because of its numerous use cases and Web3 features. This year, it is the platform to add to your portfolio if you seek something new.\par \par \uc2 Lynqyo (LNQ) has a unique option of awarding bonus tokens in the cryptocurrency market. Similarly, if you buy Lynqyo (LNQ) using USDT ERC20 or \uc2 SOL\uc2 , you'll get a 10% extra token. You will earn an additional 7% bonus if you buy within the first stage. Referring a friend can also yield bonus tokens. If someone you referred buys $300 worth of tokens, you both will get $100 tokens in a bonus.\par \par \uc2 For more information on Lynqyo (LNQ), you can visit the following links:\par \par \uc2 Presale: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://buy.lynqyo.com"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://buy.lynqyo.com}}}\par \par \uc2 Website: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://lynqyo.com/"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 http://lynqyo.com/}}}\par \par \uc2 Telegram: {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://t.me/LynqYO"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 https://t.me/LynqYO}}}\par \par \uc2 Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Worldmoney Blockchain Management Co., Limited \par \par \uc2 The report states that the crypto mining industry has the capacity to transform worldwide energy production for the better, contrary to what is normally viewed as social and \uc2 environmental\uc2  harm associated with the sector.\par \par \uc2 The paper provides four ways in which mining can improve energy systems in a desirable and economical manner.\par \par \uc2 First, crypto mining is becoming a catalyst for the development of renewable energy projects. Bitcoin miners have recently started buying the cheapest sources of energy available, renewable (wind and solar) sources of energy.\par \par \uc2 In this way, cryptocurrency mining provides an economic incentive to build more renewable energy projects and help minimize fossil energy consumption.\par \par \uc2 On the second note, the constant energy produced by the flexible, reactive power of Bitcoin mining allows the industry to give back energy to the national electricity grid when demand is too high. In July, industrial miners in Texas collectively powered down to assist in protecting the grid during a heatwave as part of a state-wide demand response program.\par \par \uc2 Such reactivity will be especially important in the coming years as the world increasingly transitions from flexible fossil fuels to non-flexible renewables. Thanks to proof of work consensus powering crypto mining, renewable energy sources are becoming profitable through leveraging the portability, modularity, and agnosticism of Bitcoin miners.\par \par \uc2 Lastly, besides supporting renewable energy, crypto miners have also begun to help make oil drilling a cleaner and more efficient process.\par \par \uc2 Oil drilling normally produces natural gas that cannot always be economically harnessed for consumption. Such natural gas is beginning to become useful for crypto mining. This, therefore, helps oil companies such as \uc2 Exxon\uc2 , \uc2 Chevron\uc2 , \uc2 Saudi Aramco\uc2 , and \uc2 Gazprom\uc2 , among others, to make profits through Bitcoin mining and also reduce the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the byproduct.\par \par \uc2 Over recent years, Oil field Bitcoin mining has been growing fast, especially in the United States and Canada.\par \par \uc2 In March, \uc2 Exxon\uc2 , a major US multinational oil and gas corporation, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/exxonmobil-to-mine-bitcoin-with-excess-natural-gas"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 announced plans}}}\uc2  to use Bitcoin mining for this purpose.\par \par \uc2 The crypto economy has demonstrated that it is here to stay, as a variety of interesting new areas for investments in the industry remain constantly evolving. Crypto mining is one such avenue for business profitability.\par \par \uc2 The rapid growth of the crypto economy is not only placing fresh demands on but also offering {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/musk-abandons-twitter-board-tesla-builds-partnership-to-make-btc-mining-eco-friendly"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 new hopes}}}\uc2  for electricity grids. Crypto mining offers energy firms new opportunities to create new revenue streams, improve demand response, and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://blockchain.news/news/bitcoin-accelerates-the-development-renewable-energy-bitcoin-mining"}}{\fldrslt{\cf2 \uc2 accelerate the expansion}}}\uc2  of the long-term renewable resource base.\par \par \uc2 Document BLCRNW0020220906ei960000b\par }\par }}
