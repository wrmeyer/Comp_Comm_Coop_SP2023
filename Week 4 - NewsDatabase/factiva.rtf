\par\par \uc2 THE SHIFT\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Good Tech Awards: What Went Right in 2022\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kevin Roose \par \uc2 1,519 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 December 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The year 2022, in the tech world, was one of big leaps and even bigger pratfalls.\par \par \uc2 The falls included some of the industry's most recognizable names. \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  began the year as the biggest celebrity in crypto, with a net worth of more than $20 billion, and ends it as a disgraced pariah who is facing criminal fraud charges. \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  began 2022 as the world's richest man, with a thriving electric car company and a name synonymous with success; he ends it more than $100 billion poorer, as the bitter and beleaguered owner of a social media company that seems to be ruining his life.\par \par \uc2 The tech industry struggled, too, with harsh macroeconomic conditions, including high inflation and rising interest rates. As the sector's decade of hypergrowth came to an end, start-ups died, tech giants cut perks and laid off workers, and investors' dreams of a new, crypto-fied internet known as ''web3'' faded into oblivion.\par \par \uc2 But focusing exclusively on what went wrong risks missing the many noble, clever and socially valuable tech projects that made progress this year.\par \par \uc2 For several years now, I've highlighted these kinds of projects in my annual Good Tech Awards column. These aren't necessarily technologies that I'm sure will improve the world, while causing no problems whatsoever. They're tools that I believe could improve the world, or help address thorny societal challenges. Some of them could also go quite badly, if they're mismanaged or co-opted in harmful ways.\par \par \uc2 There were many to choose from this year. Here's what made the final cut.\par \par \uc2 To OpenAI and the makers of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, for proving that A.I. can create\par \par \uc2 The splashiest tech breakthrough of the year, by a significant margin, was the boom in ''generative A.I.'' -- a term for the new type of artificial intelligence apps, trained on vast amounts of data, that can create new media objects out of thin air.\par \par \uc2 This year, A.I. image generators like DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney dazzled users (including me) with their creations and set off a Cambrian explosion of new, ultracapable A.I. tools. In recent weeks, ChatGPT, a text-generating A.I. built by OpenAI, became a viral sensation (and every teacher's worst nightmare) when it started cranking out term papers, original poetry and working snippets of code.\par \par \uc2 Some credit for the generative A.I. boom should go to \uc2 Google\uc2 , which created much of the foundational technology. But this year, \uc2 Google\uc2  (which has kept most of its A.I. experiments private, to its recent chagrin) got one-upped by OpenAI, as well as the makers of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion, all of which released public-facing products that allowed millions of people to experience generative A.I. for themselves.\par \par \uc2 The ultimate effects of generative A.I. are still unknown. Some people argue that these apps will destroy millions of jobs, while others argue that they'll be a boon to human creativity. But whether you're an A.I. optimist or pessimist, this year's advances mean that we are no longer debating theoretical costs and benefits -- the tools have arrived, and we now get to decide how to use them.\par \par \uc2 To Ethereum developers, for pulling off the merge\par \par \uc2 I know, I know. Putting a crypto project in a ''good tech'' list in 2022 feels like putting credit default swaps in a ''cool financial innovations'' list in 2008.\par \par \uc2 But while the crypto industry took a nosedive this year -- wiping out trillions of dollars in value and leaving many investors empty-handed -- there was at least one bright spot. In September, Ethereum, the network behind the second most valuable cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, completed what was known as ''the merge'' -- a hulking, years-in-the-making project to switch Ethereum from an energy-guzzling form of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  known as ''proof of work'' to a much greener form of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  known as ''proof of stake.''\par \par \uc2 The switch, which crypto developers compared to trying to swap a plane's engine in midair, was a smashing success, and cut the energy required to power Ethereum by more than 99 percent. (It didn't, however, boost the price of the cryptocurrency, Ether, which ended the year down nearly 70 percent.)\par \par \uc2 To Living Carbon, Twelve and BeeHero, for turning tech on the climate crisis\par \par \uc2 While 2022 was a horrible year for start-up fund-raising in general, it was a great year for climate tech start-ups, which raised billions of dollars to bring climate-friendly technologies to market.\par \par \uc2 There are too many promising climate tech start-ups to name -- and, to be honest, I don't know enough about climate science to tell which ones stand the best chance of succeeding -- but a few that caught my eye this year were Living Carbon, Twelve and BeeHero.\par \par \uc2 Living Carbon, a three-year-old California start-up, is genetically engineering trees and other plants to capture and store more carbon from the atmosphere. These G.M.O. supertrees, the company claims, grow bigger and faster than normal trees and can survive in soil with metal concentrations that would be toxic to other plants.\par \par \uc2 Twelve, which is based in Berkeley, Calif., is using a novel electrochemical process to turn carbon dioxide into industrial products as varied as sunglasses and jet fuel. The company raised a $130 million funding round this year and struck deals with companies like \uc2 Mercedes-Benz\uc2  and \uc2 Procter & Gamble\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 BeeHero, which was started in Israel in 2017, is using new technology to address problems facing one of the most important parts of our global food supply: bees. Bees pollinate more than one-third of all crops, but they are dying off at alarming rates, setting off fears of a food shortage. To tackle this, BeeHero developed a ''precision pollination platform'' -- basically, a bee-tracking sensor system that allows for industrial beekeepers to monitor the health and productivity of their hives in real time. The company raised a $42 million Series B (Series Bee?) round this year from investors including \uc2 General Mills\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 To the National Ignition Facility, Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Helion, for keeping the fusion dream alive\par \par \uc2 Nuclear fusion, an emissions-free form of energy generation that has long been viewed as the ''holy grail of energy,'' took a few important steps toward reality this year.\par \par \uc2 The biggest fusion news of the year came just a few weeks ago when scientists at the National Ignition Facility at \uc2 Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory\uc2  in California crossed a major threshold known as ''ignition,'' creating a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it took to produce. That breakthrough was hailed by officials including \uc2 Jennifer M. Granholm\uc2 , the secretary of energy, who called it a ''landmark achievement.''\par \par \uc2 Many start-ups have also been plugging away on fusion. One, \uc2 Helion Energy\uc2 , has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from well-known investors including \uc2 Sam Altman\uc2 , Dustin Moskovitz and Peter Thiel to create affordable, mass-market fusion technology. Helion says it plans to create energy with its next fusion reactor, Polaris, by 2024. Another company, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which was spun out of the \uc2 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\uc2  in 2018, is using an array of powerful magnets to power its prototype fusion machine outside Boston, and plans to have it up and running by 2025.\par \par \uc2 Experts have cautioned that despite the latest breakthroughs, affordable fusion power may not be widely available for years. But this year, both the public and private sectors offered a glimpse of a fusion-powered future.\par \par \uc2 To Locket, for making photo-sharing fun again\par \par \uc2 If 2022 was the year when social media died, it was also the year when start-ups began trying to recapture what had made social media fun in the first place.\par \par \uc2 One app I've loved using this year is Locket. It's a very simple premise -- a widget that is installed on your smartphone's home screen, creating a kind of digital photo frame that your closest friends and loved ones can upload photos to.\par \par \uc2 Locket was created by Matt Moss, a young developer who wanted a way to send photos to his long-distance girlfriend; this year, the app quickly grew to millions of users, raised a major funding round and won an \uc2 Apple\uc2  cultural impact award. There are no filters, preening influencers, data-harvesting schemes or algorithmic feeds on Locket -- it's just an easy, no-frills way to share photos with your loved ones.\par \par \uc2 My wife and I started using Locket this year to share photos of our kid, in a way that wouldn't require us digging through text chains or huge photo albums to find them later on. It's not the tech product I've used most often, or the one I think will create the most net good for society. But it's fun, uncomplicated and respectful of its users -- three qualities to which more tech products should aspire.\par \par \uc2 This article appeared in print on page B1, B7. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020221230eicu0004f\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 A Traditional Exchange? FTX Was Anything But.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joe Rennison \par \uc2 1,401 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 December 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 FTX called itself an exchange. But it was vastly different from stock exchanges, which are highly regulated and barred from engaging in many of the activities FTX pursued.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency trading platforms like FTX have acquired a sheen of legitimacy in recent years by billing themselves as exchanges -- creating an association with staid and trusted financial institutions like the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.\par \par \uc2 But the implosion of FTX shows just how different crypto exchanges are from their more well known, and highly regulated, counterparts. The latter must abide by strict rules about what they can and cannot do. Crypto exchanges face few such hurdles, especially if they are outside the United States -- and most are. They don't have to disclose how customer money is handled, either to investors or to a regulatory body. Internal financial controls can be scant.\par \par \uc2 The absence of oversight contributed to what prosecutors said was a yearslong, widespread fraud at FTX, once the crypto world's second largest exchange. Founded by \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  in 2019, FTX used customer funds to finance political donations, buy real estate and invest in other companies, U.S. authorities said this week. FTX filed for bankruptcy in November after being unable to meet about $8 billion in customer withdrawal requests.\par \par \uc2 By contrast, \uc2 LedgerX\uc2 , a crypto derivatives exchange owned by FTX, was based in the United States and was more strictly regulated. It is still standing.\par \par \uc2 FTX did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 ''Where is the industry exposed? It's still exposed on exchange,'' said Nicola White, the chief executive of B2C2, a cryptocurrency trading firm. Ms. White said that B2C2 had limited the assets it held on FTX, but still had a small amount trapped on the defunct exchange.\par \par \uc2 ''We need proof of where exchanges hold our money and how,'' she said. ''It's really important.''\par \par \uc2 The traditional financial industry became a highly regulated one over decades of scandal, fraud and other costly lapses that led to steep losses for customers and wider market contagion. The 2008 financial crisis alone prompted reams of new regulation designed to protect investor assets and limit risk-taking by banks and other firms.\par \par \uc2 The cryptocurrency industry grew outside of the traditional financial system. It built its market structure from scratch, creating new rules meant to make business more efficient by combining a lot of jobs that are typically separated in more regulated exchanges -- such as trading, custody of client assets and trade settlement.\par \par \uc2 Customers trading on FTX's main exchange, which was based in the Bahamas, had to send cash or cryptocurrency to the platform before they could trade. Cryptocurrency deposits were sent from a customer's personal wallet to the customer's FTX account. If a customer sent funds in cash, the money was converted into ''e-money,'' according to FTX's terms of service, which was then used to buy cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 FTX's terms of service made no mention of how, or where, client assets would be stored. Instead, there was a brief line saying that the legal title of any digital assets passed to FTX remained the property of the customer.\par \par \uc2 ''None of the Digital Assets in your Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, \uc2 FTX Trading\uc2 ; \uc2 FTX Trading\uc2  does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User's Accounts as belonging to \uc2 FTX Trading\uc2 ,'' said the terms of service. There was no similar declaration for cash assets.\par \par \uc2 FTX's alleged use of customer assets to fund its activities would be highly unlikely at U.S. stock exchanges, which don't touch any customer money. Instead, stock market investors send their money to a broker who is a member of the exchange and can act on behalf of their clients. Larger institutional investors typically hold money with a custodian bank like State Street or BNY Mellon, sending trade details via their brokers to the exchange. Custodian banks are responsible for protecting investors' assets, with strict rules on what they can do with them.\par \par \uc2 The exchange simply acts as a meeting place for buyers and sellers, collecting transaction and other fees for providing the service. Every trade conducted on an exchange contains instructions about what should happen next to ensure that money ends up in the correct accounts and that the ownership of whatever stock is being bought or sold transfers to the buyer.\par \par \uc2 Most banks are also brokers, catering mainly to professional and high net worth investors. \uc2 Robinhood\uc2 , \uc2 Charles Schwab\uc2  and other brokerages target retail investors. Exchanges are prohibited from owning brokerages, other than for sending trades to other exchanges if there is a better price for a stock elsewhere. And brokerages can own, at most, 20 percent of an exchange.\par \par \uc2 The rules are meant to prevent any conflicts of interest that can arise if a brokerage shares ownership with the exchange where the trades happen, and where the broker or its client stand to make and lose money on trades.\par \par \uc2 In contrast, Alameda Trading, one of the biggest trading firms on FTX that was at the center of its collapse, was also co-founded by Mr. Bankman-Fried. FTX has been accused of using customer money to prop up Alameda's trading activity. Given the bankruptcy, it's likely that FTX customers will never get all of their money back.\par \par \uc2 If a regulated stock exchange were to suffer the same fate as FTX, the separation of duty at different links in the trading chain means that customer money would be less likely to get caught up in the bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 ''Investor protections, such as the segregation of roles between trading venues, market makers and asset custodians, are a hallmark of regulated exchanges like the N.Y.S.E.,'' said Michael Blaugrund, the chief operating officer of the \uc2 New York Stock Exchange\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even tracking customer assets on FTX could prove tricky, because of the limited books and records. John J. Ray III, the chief executive of FTX, told lawmakers this week that he was dealing with a ''literal paperless bankruptcy.''\par \par \uc2 Trading on FTX also differed from traditional exchanges in that not all trades were publicly recorded. While crypto currency transactions are meant to be recorded on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , a public digital ''ledger,'' any trading that happened using those crypto holdings within the FTX platform did not get publicly recorded -- only customer deposits or withdrawals hit the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . On a U.S. stock exchange, every individual trade is accounted for.\par \par \uc2 In prepared remarks to U.S. lawmakers in February, Mr. Bankman-Fried said that at FTX, a ''key investor-protection principle is making sure there is adequate bookkeeping (and related records) to track the customer's assets, combined with appropriate disclosure and reporting.''\par \par \uc2 This was done, he said, ''to ensure that whoever is in control of a customer's assets is not mis-allocating or misusing those assets, particularly in furtherance to their own purposes at the expense of the customer's best interests.''\par \par \uc2 The comments, undermined by the now known facts, highlight that written statements are worth little without oversight and enforcement.\par \par \uc2 FTX's U.S. derivatives exchange, \uc2 LedgerX\uc2 , is subject to more stringent rules surrounding derivatives trading that were introduced after the global financial crisis. Those rules are overseen and enforced by multiple regulators, primarily the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  -- and abiding by them is arguably what kept \uc2 LedgerX\uc2  out of bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 Yet FTX had plans to export elements of its trading model to \uc2 LedgerX\uc2 . In December 2021, it sought approval from U.S. regulators to use customer money for \uc2 LedgerX\uc2 's own ''temporary'' needs. The changes weren't approved before FTX's collapse.\par \par \uc2 Other crypto exchanges have since sought to soothe investors' concerns over how their assets are treated. But it remains a far cry from the assurance, evidence and oversight in more regulated markets.\par \par \uc2 ''What's the lesson learned?'' asked Chris Perkins, president of Coinfund, a crypto investment firm. ''The regulated part of the business worked. The other stuff was fast and loose. But even if the regulation is perfect, fraud is fraud. The key is transparency.''\par \par \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of FTX, was charged by the United States this week with a host of financial crimes.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The movement's leading intellectuals told us to fear killer robots. They didn't think to mention the crypto billionaire next door.\par \par \uc2 The disgraced crypto entrepreneur \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  wanted people to know that the enormous risks he took were in the service of humanity -- that, at least, was the impression he tried to give on Nov. 30 in an interview at \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 's DealBook Summit. The famously jittery Bankman-Fried, who was arrested on Monday night on fraud charges, looked relatively subdued as he Zoomed in for the interview from a dimly lit room in the Bahamas, a tax haven whose regulatory environment was particularly suited to his crypto ambitions.\par \par \uc2 ''Look, there are a lot of things that I think have really a massive impact on the world,'' Bankman-Fried said. ''And ultimately that's what I care about the most. And, I mean, I think frankly that the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  industry could have a substantial positive impact. I was thinking a lot about, you know, bed nets and malaria, about, you know, saving people from diseases no one should die from.''\par \par \uc2 This is the language of effective altruism -- or E.A. -- a philanthropic movement premised on the use of reason and data to do good. Bankman-Fried had long flaunted his E.A. bona fides to distinguish himself from other crypto billionaires. Earn a lot to give a lot. Direct your bounty to where it will matter the most. Now his crypto exchange, FTX, has collapsed, wiping out small investors and wreaking havoc in the industry. To hear Bankman-Fried tell it, the idea was to make billions through his crypto-trading firm, \uc2 Alameda Research\uc2 , and FTX, the exchange he created for it -- funneling the proceeds into the humble cause of ''bed nets and malaria,'' thereby saving poor people's lives.\par \par \uc2 But last summer Bankman-Fried was telling The New Yorker's Gideon Lewis-Kraus something quite different. ''He told me that he never had a bed-nets phase, and considered neartermist causes -- global health and poverty -- to be more emotionally driven,'' Lewis-Kraus wrote in August. Effective altruists talk about both ''neartermism'' and ''longtermism.'' Bankman-Fried said he wanted his money to address longtermist threats like the dangers posed by artificial intelligence spiraling out of control. As he put it, funding for the eradication of tropical diseases should come from other people who actually cared about tropical diseases: ''Like, not me or something.'' (It looks increasingly unlikely that the nonprofits he started will be able to honor their financial commitments to his favored causes.)\par \par \uc2 To the uninitiated, the fact that Bankman-Fried saw a special urgency in preventing killer robots from taking over the world might sound too outlandish to seem particularly effective or altruistic. But it turns out that some of the most influential E.A. literature happens to be preoccupied with killer robots too.\par \par \uc2 The movement itself is still a big tent; there are effective altruists who remain dedicated to targeted interventions with proven results, including vaccination campaigns (and, of course, antimalarial bed nets). \uc2 Holden Karnofsky\uc2 , a former hedge funder and a founder of \uc2 GiveWell\uc2 , an organization that assesses the cost-effectiveness of charities, has spoken about the need for ''worldview diversification'' -- recognizing that there might be multiple ways of doing measurable good in a world filled with suffering and uncertainty.\par \par \uc2 The books, however, are another matter. Considerations of immediate need pale next to speculations about existential risk -- not just earthly concerns about climate change and pandemics but also (and perhaps most appealingly for some tech entrepreneurs) more extravagant theorizing about space colonization and A.I. Sometimes the books put me in mind of a bunch of smart, well-intentioned people trying to impress and outdo one another by anticipating the next weird thing. Instead of ''worldview diversification'' there's a remarkable intellectual homogeneity; the dominant voices belong to white male philosophers at Oxford.\par \par \uc2 Nick Bostrom's ''Superintelligence'' (2014) warns about the dangers posed by machines that might learn how to think better than we do; Toby Ord's ''The Precipice'' (2020) enumerates the cataclysms that could annihilate us. William MacAskill has translated such doomsday portents into the friendlier language of can-do and how-to. In his recent best seller, ''What We Owe the Future'' (2022), MacAskill says that the case for effective altruism giving priority to the longtermist view can be distilled into three simple sentences: ''Future people count. There could be a lot of them. We can make their lives go better.''\par \par \uc2 At first glance, all of this looks straightforward enough. MacAskill repeatedly calls longtermism ''common sense'' and ''intuitive.'' But each of those terse sentences glosses over a host of additional questions, and it takes MacAskill an entire book to address them. Take the notion that ''future people count.'' Leaving aside the possibility that the very contemplation of a hypothetical person may not, for some real people, be ''intuitive'' at all, another question remains: Do future people count for more or less than existing people count for right now?\par \par \uc2 This question is like an inflection point between neartermism and longtermism. MacAskill cites the philosopher Derek Parfit, whose ideas about population ethics in his 1984 book ''Reasons and Persons'' have been influential in E.A. Parfit argued that an extinction-level event that destroyed 100 percent of the population should worry us much more than a near-extinction event that spared a minuscule population (which would presumably go on to procreate), because the number of potential lives dwarfs the number of existing ones. There are eight billion people in the world now; in ''The Precipice,'' Ord names Parfit as his mentor and encourages us to think about the ''trillions of human lives'' to come.\par \par \uc2 If you're a utilitarian committed to ''the greatest good for the greatest number,'' the arithmetic looks irrefutable. The Times's Ezra Klein has written about his support for effective altruism while also thoughtfully critiquing longtermism's more fanatical expressions of ''mathematical blackmail.'' But to judge by much of the literature, it's precisely the more categorical assertions of rationality that have endowed the movement with its intellectual cachet.\par \par \uc2 In 2015, MacAskill published ''Doing Good Better,'' which is also about the virtues of effective altruism. His concerns in that book (blindness, deworming) seem downright quaint when compared with the astral-plane conjectures (A.I., building an ''interstellar civilization'') that he would go on to pursue in ''What We Owe the Future.'' Yet the upbeat prose style has stayed consistent. In both books he emphasizes the desirability of seeking out ''neglectedness'' -- problems that haven't attracted enough attention so that you, as an effective altruist, can be more ''impactful.'' So climate change, MacAskill says, isn't really where it's at anymore; readers would do better to focus on ''the issues around A.I. development,'' which are ''radically more neglected.''\par \par \uc2 The thinking is presented as precise and neat. Like Bostrom and Ord (and Parfit, for that matter), MacAskill is an Oxford philosopher. He is also one of the founders of effective altruism -- as well as the person who, in 2012, recruited an M.I.T. undergraduate named \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  to the effective altruism cause.\par \par \uc2 At the time, the logic of MacAskill's recruiting strategy must have seemed impeccable. Among his E.A. innovations has been the career research organization known as 80,000 Hours, which promotes ''earning to give'' -- the idea that altruistic people should pursue careers that will earn them oodles of money, which they can then donate to E.A. causes.\par \par \uc2 ''The conventional advice is that if you want to make a difference you should work in the nonprofit or public sector or work in corporate social responsibility,'' MacAskill writes in ''Doing Good Better.'' But conventional is boring, and if the math tells you that your energies would be more effectively spent courting promising tech savants with sky-high earning potential, conventional probably won't get you a lot of new recruits.\par \par \uc2 ''Earning to give'' has its roots in the work of the radical utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer, whose 1972 essay ''Famine, Affluence and Morality'' has been a foundational E.A. text. It contains his parable of the drowning child: If you're walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning, you should wade in and save the child, even if it means muddying your clothes. Extrapolating from that principle suggests that if you can save a life by donating an amount of money that won't pose any significant problems for you, a decision not to donate that money would be not only uncharitable or ungenerous but morally wrong.\par \par \uc2 Singer has also written his own book about effective altruism, ''The Most Good You Can Do'' (2015), in which he argues that going into finance would be an excellent career choice for the aspiring effective altruist. He acknowledges the risks for harm, but he deems them worth it. Chances are, if you don't become a charity worker, someone else will ably do the job; whereas if you don't become a financier who gives his money away, who's to say that the person who does become a financier won't hoard all his riches for himself?\par \par \uc2 Still, some people need to become philosopher-influencers in order to spread the word. ''Will isn't in finance,'' Singer writes, referring specifically to MacAskill. ''That's because he believes that if he can influence two other people with earning capacities similar to his own to earn to give, he will have done more good than if he had gone into finance himself.''\par \par \uc2 Or maybe not. On Nov. 11, when FTX filed for bankruptcy amid allegations of financial impropriety, MacAskill wrote a long \uc2 Twitter\uc2  thread expressing his shock and his anguish, as he wrestled in real time with what Bankman-Fried had wrought.\par \par \uc2 ''If those involved deceived others and engaged in fraud (whether illegal or not) that may cost many thousands of people their savings, they entirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community,'' MacAskill wrote in a Tweet, followed by screenshots from ''What We Owe the Future'' and Ord's ''The Precipice'' that emphasized the importance of honesty and integrity.\par \par \uc2 I'm guessing that Bankman-Fried may not have read the pertinent parts of those books -- if, that is, he read any parts of those books at all. ''I would never read a book,'' Bankman-Fried said earlier this year. ''I'm very skeptical of books. I don't want to say no book is ever worth reading, but I actually do believe something pretty close to that.''\par \par \uc2 Avoiding books is an efficient method for absorbing the crudest version of effective altruism while gliding past the caveats. In the paperback edition of ''Superintelligence,'' which laid out a framework for thinking about a robot apocalypse, Bostrom delivers the equivalent of a warning label to ''those whose lives have become so busy that they have ceased to actually read the books they buy, except perhaps for a glance at the table of contents and the stuff at the front and toward the back.''\par \par \uc2 But the books themselves may have incentivized blind spots of their own. For all of MacAskill's galaxy-brain disquisitions on ''A.I. takeover'' and the ''moral case for space settlement,'' perhaps the E.A. fixation on ''neglectedness'' and existential risks made him less attentive to more familiar risks -- human, banal and closer to home.\par \par \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried, a prominent follower of effective altruism and founder of the now bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A group chat including crypto leaders shows \uc2 Binance\uc2 's \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2  accusing FTX's \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  of orchestrating trades to destabilize the industry.\par \par \uc2 The day before the embattled cryptocurrency exchange FTX filed for bankruptcy, \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2 , the chief executive of the rival exchange \uc2 Binance\uc2 , sent an alarmed text to \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2 , FTX's founder.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhao was concerned that Mr. Bankman-Fried was orchestrating crypto trades that could send the industry into a meltdown. ''Stop now, don't cause more damage,'' Mr. Zhao wrote in a group chat with Mr. Bankman-Fried and other crypto executives on Nov. 10. ''The more damage you do now, the more jail time.''\par \par \uc2 FTX and its sister hedge fund, \uc2 Alameda Research\uc2 , had just collapsed after a run on deposits exposed an $8 billion hole in the exchange's accounts. The implosion unleashed a crypto crisis, as firms with ties to FTX teetered on the brink of bankruptcy, calling the future of the entire industry into question.\par \par \uc2 The series of about a dozen group texts between Mr. Zhao and Mr. Bankman-Fried on Nov. 10, which were obtained by \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 , show that key crypto leaders feared that the situation could get even worse. And their frantic communications offer a rare glimpse into the unusual way business is conducted behind the scenes in the industry, with at least three top officials from rival companies exchanging messages in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal.\par \par \uc2 The texts also show that industry leaders were acutely aware that the actions of a single firm or fluctuations in the value of one virtual currency could destabilize the whole industry. The exchanges became increasingly tense as Mr. Bankman-Fried and Mr. Zhao traded barbs.\par \par \uc2 Earlier that week, Mr. Zhao had agreed to buy FTX and save the exchange, before backing out of the deal. In the Nov. 10 texts, he appeared certain that FTX would not survive, and concerned that it could bring the rest of the industry down with it. During a crypto crash in May, two currencies had plunged in value, setting off an industrywide meltdown and forcing several prominent firms into bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 In the Nov. 10 texts, Mr. Zhao specifically accused Mr. Bankman-Fried of using his hedge fund to drive down the price of Tether, a so-called stablecoin whose price is designed to remain at $1. According to messages seen by The Times and people familiar with the matter, the group chat included several other prominent crypto executives, including \uc2 Jesse Powell\uc2 , a founder of the crypto exchange Kraken, and Paolo Ardoino, the chief technology officer of Tether, the company that issues the stablecoin of the same name.\par \par \uc2 Tether is a linchpin of crypto trading worldwide, commonly used by digital asset enthusiasts to conduct transactions. Industry insiders have long feared that if Tether's price fell, it would cause a domino effect that might bring the industry to its knees. (Tether ultimately did not end up losing its $1 peg.)\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for \uc2 Binance\uc2  declined to comment on the text exchanges. A spokeswoman for Kraken declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, said in a statement that Mr. Zhao's claims were ''absurd.''\par \par \uc2 ''Trades of that size would not make a material impact on Tether's pricing, and to my knowledge neither myself nor Alameda has ever attempted to intentionally depeg Tether or any other stablecoins,'' he said. ''I have made a number of mistakes over the past year but this is not one of them.''\par \par \uc2 A spokeswoman for Tether said in a statement that the company had ''demonstrated its resilience to attacks.'' She added that FTX's actions ''don't reflect the ethos and commitment of an entire industry.''\par \par \uc2 FTX, a marketplace where people could buy and sell digital currencies, collapsed early last month when customers rushed to withdraw deposits, partly in response to tweets by Mr. Zhao that called the company's finances into question. FTX soon folded, setting off investigations by the Justice Department and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  into whether the crypto exchange broke the law by using its customers' funds to prop up Alameda.\par \par \uc2 The Justice Department is also investigating whether Mr. Bankman-Fried engaged in market manipulation in the spring by making trades that contributed to the failure of two prominent cryptocurrencies.\par \par \uc2 For years, critics of the crypto industry have said Tether could also be vulnerable to a collapse. Tether has long claimed that its stablecoins are backed by cash and other traditional assets, and that in a crisis, all of its customers could redeem their coins for the equivalent amount in dollars. But regulators have previously accused Tether of lying about the status of its reserves, sowing doubts about the coin's reliability.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bankman-Fried was once a major Tether customer. Before he agreed to the deal with \uc2 Binance\uc2 , he met with a top Tether official in the Bahamas, where FTX was based, and asked for billions in funding to prop up his exchange, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Tether declined to help, the person said.\par \par \uc2 In one of the Nov. 10 messages to the group, Mr. Zhao pointed out a $250,000 trade by Alameda that he said was intended to destabilize Tether. The trade was visible on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , a public ledger of cryptocurrency transactions that anyone can view.\par \par \uc2 In response to Mr. Zhao's accusations, Mr. Bankman-Fried seemed nonplused. ''Huh?'' he said. ''What am I doing to stablecoins?''\par \par \uc2 ''Are you claiming that you think that $250k of USDT trading would depeg it?'' he added, using a common shorthand to refer to the Tether currency.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhao responded that he didn't think a trade of that size would succeed in destroying Tether, but that it could still cause problems.\par \par \uc2 ''My honest advice: stop doing everything,'' Mr. Zhao said. ''Put on a suit, and go back to DC, and start to answer questions.''\par \par \uc2 ''Thanks for the advice!'' Mr. Bankman-Fried shot back.\par \par \uc2 Changpeng Zhao, founder of Binance, was part of the group chat on Nov. 10.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 After FTX, Crypto Sector Scrambles To Save Itself\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,629 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 December 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The implosion of the exchange FTX shows how an industry built in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has drifted far from its original ideals.\par \par \uc2 To hear more audio stories from publications like \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 , download Audm for iPhone or Android .\par \par \uc2 Not long after several Wall Street banks collapsed in 2008, a nine-page document circulated on an obscure mailing list, proposing a new kind of financial system that wouldn't rely on any ''trusted third party.''\par \par \uc2 The paper was the basis for what became the cryptocurrency industry. Using sweeping, idealistic language, its adherents vowed to conduct business in a transparent and egalitarian way, rejecting the high-risk practices of a small number of powerful financial firms that caused the Great Recession.\par \par \uc2 But last month, the actions of a single crypto firm -- the $32 billion exchange FTX -- plunged the emerging industry into its own version of a 2008-style crisis. Once considered a safe marketplace for people to trade virtual currencies, FTX filed for bankruptcy after the crypto equivalent of a bank run, forcing industry executives, investors and enthusiasts to grapple with how a technology meant to correct the shortcomings of traditional finance ended up replicating them.\par \par \uc2 Executives who just a year ago were reveling amid crypto's seemingly unstoppable growth are now scrambling to prove that they can learn from the mistakes and recapture the industry's early ideals. \uc2 Binance\uc2 , the world's largest exchange, announced last month that it would release more information about its finances and recruit independent auditors to review those disclosures. \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , the biggest U.S. crypto exchange, proclaimed that it was committed to a ''decentralized system where you don't have to trust us.''\par \par \uc2 Many crypto advocates are pushing for more drastic reforms, urging investors not to store their digital holdings with big companies and instead turn to more experimental platforms run solely by code.\par \par \uc2 But for all the promises of change, FTX's collapse shows how far crypto remains from fulfilling its original aims and gaining widespread acceptance. Consumer distrust has mounted this year amid major financial losses, criminal investigations and an increasingly skeptical regulatory climate in Washington. At a conference last month, \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2 , \uc2 Binance\uc2 's chief executive, said that FTX's implosion would set the industry back by years.\par \par \uc2 The exchange's downfall compounded months of losses in the virtual currency market set off by a devastating crash in the spring that unfolded amid a broader pullback from risky assets. The upheaval sent some prominent crypto firms into bankruptcy. Bitcoin, the original and most popular cryptocurrency, has been trading at less than $17,000, down about 75 percent from its high of nearly $70,000 almost exactly a year ago.\par \par \uc2 ''You start to go through these problems, and they stack up one after the other after the other,'' said John Reed Stark, a former \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  official who has become an outspoken crypto critic. ''More and more people are seeing this for the scam that it is.''\par \par \uc2 The crypto industry has bounced back after previous crashes, attracting big-name investors who poured even more money into experimental companies. But FTX's collapse has been widely described as the worst moment in the industry's short history.\par \par \uc2 The origins of crypto date to 2008, when a mysterious figure known as \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  published a white paper on Bitcoin, laying out a detailed vision for what became cryptocurrencies. The paper outlined Bitcoin's technological foundation, which was a publicly viewable ledger called a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  where transactions would be recorded for all to see.\par \par \uc2 Early enthusiasts thought Bitcoin could become the foundation of a more transparent, egalitarian financial system. Many of the paper's supporters were libertarians who had grown disillusioned with traditional finance, especially the concentration of power among a small number of companies.\par \par \uc2 At first, crypto's primary use was criminal. Thieves and drug dealers used Bitcoin to transfer large amounts of money without relying on a bank or another intermediary to process transactions.\par \par \uc2 But over the years, law enforcement got better at tracking crypto crime, and the technology evolved to allow more sophisticated financial applications, like borrowing and lending. People who started their careers on Wall Street -- including FTX's founder, \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2 , who worked at the trading firm Jane Street -- got involved in the nascent industry, looking to profit from the technology.\par \par \uc2 As the industry grew, it started assuming some of the same characteristics as the Wall Street institutions that it was designed to replace. Crypto trading became increasingly centralized, with a large portion of transactions taking place on a handful of big exchanges, including \uc2 Binance\uc2 , FTX and \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 . In the months leading up to FTX's collapse, the trading volume of cryptocurrencies on \uc2 Binance\uc2  alone was greater than the combined totals of its seven closest competitors, according to an industry data tracker.\par \par \uc2 The original vision of crypto ''was an attempt to rewrite the rules of finance on a global basis,'' said Charley Cooper, managing director at the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company R3. ''And here we are again -- we're in an even more centralized industry than we'd see in banking.''\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrencies soared in value last year and into 2022 -- until May. That was when a popular cryptocurrency called Luna crashed, sending the crypto economy into free-fall. Two major lending companies, \uc2 Celsius Network\uc2  and \uc2 Voyager Digital\uc2 , filed for bankruptcy. Enthusiasts lamented the onset of a ''crypto winter'' of depressed prices and fading enthusiasm.\par \par \uc2 Amid the crisis, FTX was considered a relatively trustworthy force. Based in the Bahamas, the company served as a marketplace for people to buy and sell cryptocurrencies, offering high-risk but popular trading options that are illegal in the United States. Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, who had built FTX into a $32 billion company, bailed out struggling firms and built a reputation as a benevolent figure willing to extend a lifeline to colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Then last month, a run on deposits exposed an $8 billion hole in FTX's accounts. The company filed for bankruptcy within a week. The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  and the Justice Department opened investigations, focused on whether FTX illegally lent its users' funds to \uc2 Alameda Research\uc2 , a crypto hedge fund that Mr. Bankman-Fried also founded and owned.\par \par \uc2 The implosion has been described as a ''Lehman moment'' for crypto, a reference to the investment bank whose implosion helped set off the 2008 financial crisis. Other companies with ties to FTX started to teeter. Last Monday, the crypto lender BlockFi, one of the companies that FTX had bailed out in the spring, filed for bankruptcy, citing its entanglements with Mr. Bankman-Fried.\par \par \uc2 Some prominent figures in crypto have tried spinning FTX's downfall as a positive development, arguing that it will redirect energy toward finding practical uses for the technology.\par \par \uc2 ''For us, this is actually a great moment,'' said \uc2 Jeremy Allaire\uc2 , the chief executive of the crypto payments company Circle. ''We're delivering real value, and the people who focused on building giant speculative trading casinos are not so happy.''\par \par \uc2 Binance\uc2  operates essentially the same type of business as FTX, but Mr. Zhao, the chief executive, has recently been careful to differentiate himself from Mr. Bankman-Fried, calling his one-time rival a liar and criticizing FTX's most dangerous practices. On Nov. 25, \uc2 Binance\uc2  announced a new ''proof of reserves system,'' promising to keep users informed about the amount of cryptocurrency in its accounts and to dispel fears that it might be vulnerable to the type of run on deposits that destroyed FTX. (But \uc2 Binance\uc2 's plans were heavily criticized for lacking key information.)\par \par \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  has also tried to alleviate fears of a collapse, publishing a blog post that said it always holds the same amount of money that customers deposited. ''There can't be a 'run on the bank' at \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 ,'' the post said.\par \par \uc2 Still, the mere existence of large companies like \uc2 Binance\uc2 , \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  and FTX is antithetical to the ideals of crypto, some industry experts argue. Since FTX's collapse, some crypto enthusiasts have flocked to smaller firms in the experimental field of decentralized finance, which allows traders to borrow, lend and conduct transactions without banks or brokers, relying instead on a publicly viewable system governed by code.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 DeFi\uc2  has its own problems, including vulnerability to hackers, who have drained billions of dollars this year from the experimental projects.\par \par \uc2 ''They've based it on clunky technology that is very inefficient,'' said Hilary Allen, a finance expert at \uc2 American University\uc2 . ''They're operationally very fragile.''\par \par \uc2 Scrutiny in Washington has also intensified. \uc2 Gary Gensler\uc2 , the chair of the S.E.C., has vowed to pursue crypto companies for violations of securities law. The \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  is scheduled to hold a hearing on Dec. 13 examining FTX's collapse.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bankman-Fried has been asked to testify. In interviews with \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 , he has at times seemed agonized over FTX's bankruptcy -- and at times been strikingly flippant.\par \par \uc2 ''You know,'' he said in one interview, ''the crypto winter has been officially extended.''\par \par \uc2 Wasn't that a bit of an understatement? ''Yep,'' he replied. ''Alas.''\par \par \uc2 Audio produced by Parin Behrooz.\par \par \uc2 Audio produced by Parin Behrooz.\par \par \uc2 From top: FTX's founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, onscreen at the DealBook Summit 2022 in New York last week; Changpeng Zhao, C.E.O. of Binance, said FTX's collapse would set the industry back years; Gary Gensler, chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, vowed to pursue crypto companies for securities law violations.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 After a Financial Crash, the Crypto Party Must Go On\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jacob Bernstein \par \uc2 1,690 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 December 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Crypties was intended as a gala evening in Miami to celebrate the currencies of the future. It turned out to be more of a roast.\par \par \uc2 MIAMI -- It was not the ideal time for a celebration of the cryptocurrency industry. But the hall was booked, the guests had arrived, and so the show went on.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, shortly after \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  gave a livestreamed interview to \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  seeking to dispel the notion that he was the Bernie Madoff of the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , a few hundred people piled into the Faena Forum in South Beach, Miami, for the Crypties, an awards ceremony billing itself as the Oscars for Web 3.0.\par \par \uc2 By night's end, they would learn the winners in 10 categories, including NFT Project of the Year and Metaverse Project of the Year. The event was organized by Decrypt Studios, a film and production company financed by \uc2 Joseph Lubin\uc2 , a co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 In June, when the Crypties were announced, Bitcoin and Ethereum had lost about half their peak value in an industrywide crash that caused nearly $1 trillion to go up in a puff of virtual smoke. That was followed by the recent crumbling of \uc2 Alameda Research\uc2  and FTX, Mr. Bankman-Fried's trading platforms, a multibillion dollar implosion that has further shaken the industry.\par \par \uc2 The financial fiascos weren't enough to cancel the Crypties. The Forum, an arts and culture space designed by Rem Koolhaas, had been reserved months earlier. Invited guests had flown in from around the country.\par \par \uc2 The red carpet outside the venue wasn't exactly teeming with photographers, but what were the organizers going to do if not try to make the best of things?\par \par \uc2 ''In the financial markets, there's always risk,'' said Alanna Roazzi-Laforet, the founder of Decrypt Studios, who stood in the corner of a large cocktail area on the Forum's second floor, sipping a hurricane.\par \par \uc2 The dress code was Black Tie Optional. But in an industry where anything other than sweatpants is considered formal, and the person hired as the gala's M.C. was Josh Ostrovsky, the comedian known as The Fat Jewish, the emphasis fell squarely on optional.\par \par \uc2 At around 7 p.m., a D.J. played Avicii's remix of Coldplay's ''A Sky Full Of Stars,'' accompanied by a violinist who goes by the name Tamara. Waiters served miniature lobster rolls. The guests' cocktail chatter alternated between gallows humor and proselytizing about the inevitable transformation of humankind through next-gen tech.\par \par \uc2 Josh Thompson, who runs two companies that use the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  to spur community activism, Gotham Labs and Civics Unplugged, was among the attendees. One minute, he was introducing himself to a reporter as none other than Mr. Bankman-Fried. The next, he was saying that, despite a disastrous year for cryptocurrency, the industry's future looked bright indeed.\par \par \uc2 That was the basic opinion held by Izzy Howell, a 29-year-old entrepreneur with magenta-colored hair who is attempting to bring together fashion and NFTs with a limited edition pair of women's panties emblazoned with the phrase ''highly liquid.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Howell, who wore a sheer teal dress to the Crypties, described the phrase as a play on something she heard when she was working with derivatives-trading crypto bros who were ''constantly hopped up on Adderall, screaming about 'liquidity.'''\par \par \uc2 ''It's my anticrypto crypto project,'' she said. ''The technology is here. It's not going away, but a lot of the gambling-addicted degenerates are. I think that's a good thing.''\par \par \uc2 Moments later, guests headed upstairs to a white domed space that looked like an art-deco planetarium. On the stage, a trio of massive LCD screens displayed volcanolike images meant to conjure an idea about the disruptive metaverse. EDM was still blaring when a voice boomed from the speakers.\par \par \uc2 ''Good evening, Miami,'' it said. ''Where is \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2 ?''\par \par \uc2 People in the audience chuckled.\par \par \uc2 Moments later, The Fat Jewish walked onto the stage and launched into a searing monologue. ''This event is in Florida, the home of the natural disaster,'' he said. ''And tonight, we're going to celebrate a man-made one: cryptocurrency.''\par \par \uc2 The audience roared.\par \par \uc2 ''Your skeptical friends and your out-of-touch parents have told you that cryptocurrency was a passing fad and that all of these coins one day would be totally worthless,'' he continued. ''Right? But tonight, here at the Faena Forum, we defiantly say, 'Only some of them!' Right? Am I right?''\par \par \uc2 More applause.\par \par \uc2 ''So tonight, we're going to honor the mavericks, we're going to honor the innovators, the Redditors, the frog \uc2 Twitter\uc2  accounts, the freshly ruined e-com leaders who thought they were going to be able to retire before graduation.''\par \par \uc2 But first, The Fat Jewish said, he was going to take a page from the Oscars playbook and start with an in memoriam tribute to all the celebrities whose entries into the crypto space over the last year seemed to augur its decline.\par \par \uc2 ''They might not be dead,'' he said. ''But their dreams of striking it rich in crypto definitely are.''\par \par \uc2 The screens at his back showed the football player Odell Beckham Jr., who announced in November 2021 that he would take his salary in Bitcoin, shortly before its value began to plummet. Then came the boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. and the rapper and music producer DJ Khaled, who in 2018 were fined by the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  for promoting digital tokens without disclosing that they had been paid to do so.\par \par \uc2 Then flashed an image of Kim Kardashian, who in October agreed to a $1.26 million settlement with the S.E.C. for failing to comply with the agency's rules on the promotion of investment opportunities.\par \par \uc2 The pictures kept coming. One showed the August-September 2022 issue of Fortune magazine, with Mr. Bankman-Fried on its cover, with the headline ''The Next Warren Buffett?'' The Fat Jewish predicted that Mr. Bankman-Fried's ''trading habit'' would soon involve swapping ''cigarettes for toilet paper in prison.''\par \par \uc2 Also featured on the screens was the \uc2 YouTube\uc2  star turned media entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk. His NFT start-up, Candy Digital, was once valued at $1.5 billion. Earlier this week, the company laid off ''a large portion of its staff,'' according to Decrypt, the crypto industry news site owned by Decrypt Media, the parent company of Decrypt Studios, the Crypties' organizer.\par \par \uc2 As it turned out, the person who presented the first Cryptie award was Avery Akkineni, the president of another one of Mr. Vaynerchuk's companies, Vayner3. In what was definitely not the evening's warmest exchange, Ms. Akkineni strode onto the stage, gave a terse acknowledgment to The Fat Jewish and defended her boss, Mr. Vaynerchuk, calling him a ''complete pleasure'' to work for.\par \par \uc2 After reading the list of nominees for Game of the Year, Ms. Akkineni opened an envelope and revealed the winner: Crypto Unicorns, a pet and farming game created on the Polygon \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , backed by a digital token called MATIC. Katrina Wolfe, the product director at Laguna Games, accepted the award, but a number of the other winners did not show up.\par \par \uc2 Among those absent was Scott Martin, a digital artist known as Burnt Toast, who received an award for an NFT project done in collaboration with \uc2 Shopify\uc2 . Another person who did not make the event was \uc2 Brian Armstrong\uc2 , the CEO of \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 . His investment arm, Coinbase Ventures, won for Investor of the Year, despite having plowed $15 million into FTX and having gone in on other ventures with \uc2 Alameda Research\uc2 . Accepting the award was Shan Aggarwal, \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's head of corporate development, who gave a quick shout-out to his boss and then exited the stage.\par \par \uc2 Several awards were given out to people who are doing things on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  that run in contrast to the much publicized get-rich-quick schemes.\par \par \uc2 Celo Labs, an ''open platform'' devoted to making the world carbon negative, won the social impact award. BFF, an ''open access community'' devoted to bringing women and nonbinary people into the historically male-dominated industry, was honored for promoting diversity. And an innovator of the year award went to Erick Calderon, who until 2020 was a ceramic tile designer and is now one of the NFT market's biggest success stories.\par \par \uc2 In his remarks from the stage, Mr. Calderon professed hope that people would not chase overnight successes but would play ''the long game'' and ''walk a straight line.''\par \par \uc2 It was hard to know what to make of such utopian talk when, moments later, The Fat Jewish returned to the stage and implored people in the audience to scream out the stupidest things they had bought, back when crypto was going ''straight to the moon.'' Someone at the back of the room yelled out: ''A zebra!''\par \par \uc2 Around 10 p.m., guests moved next door to a lofty banquet hall where a tropical vibe prevailed. Waiters served mesclun salad, braised short ribs with roasted prawns and a chocolate hazelnut dome dessert.\par \par \uc2 At each place setting was a small black jewel box containing an unusual party favor: a tiny diamond stud. There was also an authenticity card, complete with a QR code. With a click of a phone camera, guests landed on a webpage thanking them for having ''stuck around for the bear,'' meaning the bear market, and for having attended the first Cryptie Awards, which aims to be an annual gala. The message further promised that each diamond had been ''tested, measured, weighed, labeled and packaged for shipment.''\par \par \uc2 At a table in the back, someone asked the venture capitalist Shawn Cheng, who works at ConsenSys Mesh, another of Mr. Lubin's companies, what the gift might be worth.\par \par \uc2 ''Nothing,'' Mr. Cheng said, laughing.

\par\par \uc2 PAUL KRUGMAN\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Blockchains: What Are They Good For?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Paul Krugman \par \uc2 971 \uc2 words\par \uc2 2 December 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A year ago Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were selling at record prices, with a combined market value of around $3 trillion; glossy ads featuring celebrities -- most infamously Matt Damon's ''Fortune Favors the Brave'' -- filled the airwaves. Politicians, including, alas, the mayor of New York, raced to align themselves with what seemed to be the coming thing. Skeptics like yours truly were told that we just didn't get it.\par \par \uc2 Since then the prices of crypto assets have plunged, while a growing number of crypto institutions have collapsed amid allegations of scandal. The implosion of FTX, which appears to have used depositors' money in an attempt to prop up a related trading firm, has made the most headlines, but it's only one entry on a growing list.\par \par \uc2 We are, many people say, going through a ''crypto winter.'' But that may understate the case. This is looking more and more like Fimbulwinter, the endless winter that, in Norse mythology, precedes the end of the world -- in this case the crypto world, not just cryptocurrencies but the whole idea of organizing economic life around the famous ''\uc2 blockchain\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 And the real question, it seems to me, is why so many people -- not just na\u239\'00\'EFve small investors, but also major financial and business players -- bought into the belief that this bad idea was the wave of the future.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 blockchain\uc2  is a digital ledger associated with an asset, recording the history of transactions in that asset -- who bought it from whom and so on. The asset could be a digital token like a Bitcoin, but it could also be a stock or even a physical thing like a shipping container. Ledgers, of course, are nothing new. What's distinctive about blockchains is that the ledgers are supposed to be decentralized: They aren't sitting on the computers of a single bank or other company; they're in the public domain, sustained by protocols that induce many people to maintain records on many servers.\par \par \uc2 These protocols are, everyone tells me, extremely clever. I'll take their word for it. The question I've never heard or seen satisfactorily answered, however, is, ''What's the point?'' Why go to the trouble and expense of maintaining a ledger in many places, and basically carrying that ledger around every time a transaction takes place?\par \par \uc2 The original rationale for Bitcoin was that it would do away with the need for trust -- you wouldn't have to worry about banks making off with your money, or governments inflating away its value. In reality, however, banks rarely steal their customers' assets, while crypto institutions more easily succumb to the temptation, and extreme inflation that destroys money's value generally happens only amid political chaos.\par \par \uc2 Still, there was an alternative, more modest justification for using \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology, if not necessarily for cryptocurrencies: It was supposed to offer a lower-cost, more secure way to keep track of transactions and stuff in general.\par \par \uc2 But that dream appears to be dying, too.\par \par \uc2 Amid all the sound and fury over FTX, I'm not sure how many people have noticed that the few institutions that seriously tried to make use of blockchains seem to be giving up.\par \par \uc2 Five years ago, it was supposed to be a big deal -- a sign of mainstream acceptance -- when Australia's stock exchange announced that it was planning to use a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  platform to clear and settle trades. Two weeks ago, it quietly canceled the plan, writing off $168 million in losses.\par \par \uc2 Maersk\uc2 , the shipping giant, has also announced that it is winding down its efforts to use a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  to manage supply chains.\par \par \uc2 A recent blog by Tim Bray, who used to work for \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2 , tells us why \uc2 Amazon\uc2  chose not to implement a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  of its own: It couldn't get a straight answer to the question, ''What useful thing does it do?''\par \par \uc2 So how did this enterprise, which never stood up to scrutiny, become such a big deal?\par \par \uc2 It was probably a combination of factors. Political ideology played a role: Not all crypto enthusiasts were right wingers, but distrust of banks -- we all know who runs them -- and government-managed money provided a hard core of support.\par \par \uc2 The romance of high tech also played a role, with the very incomprehensibility of crypto discourse acting, for a while, as a selling point. And then, as prices soared, fear of missing out -- plus large outlays on marketing and political influence-buying -- brought many others into the bubble.\par \par \uc2 It's an amazing story, and also a tragedy. It's not just the small investors who have lost much if not all of their life savings. The crypto bubble has had huge costs to society as a whole. Bitcoin mining alone uses as much energy as many countries; I've been trying to estimate the value of the resources consumed in producing fundamentally worthless tokens, and it's probably in the tens of billions of dollars, not counting the environmental damage.\par \par \uc2 Add in the costs associated with other tokens and the resources burned up in abortive efforts to apply a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  approach to everything, and we're probably talking about waste on an epic scale.\par \par \uc2 No doubt I'll hear from many people still insisting that I don't get it. But it really looks as if there never was an it to get.\par \par \uc2 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

\par\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Idle Crypto Is the Devil's Workshop\b0\par\par\uc2 By Connel Fullenkamp \par \uc2 1,285 \uc2 words\par \uc2 28 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 17\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The newest monetary system in the world may be undone by the oldest problem there is.\par \par \uc2 A few weeks ago, \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2 's FTX cryptocurrency exchange collapsed in a classic run. Investors were spooked by evidence that the exchange had mismanaged their money and couldn't pay them back, so they panicked. And they were right. They couldn't get their money back.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology behind cryptocurrency was supposed to make events like this a thing of the past. But FTX's business was to serve as a gateway into (and out of) cryptocurrency. That business still depends on humans to serve as honest gatekeepers. And we've seen over and over that humans can't resist the main temptation that comes with this role: to use their customers' money for their own purposes.\par \par \uc2 The FTX collapse could be the start of a wave of cryptocurrency exchange failures. Because these exchanges are largely unregulated, they don't face the same rules placed on other exchanges to keep their customers' money safe. And there's nobody looking over the shoulders of the exchange managers to keep them honest. Given that -- and given my experience in studying financial market development and regulation -- I think it's pretty likely that other firms are doing what FTX did with its customers' money, and that some of them will blow up in the same way, especially now that crypto investors are nervous and looking for signs of trouble.\par \par \uc2 A similar wave of crashes played out recently in China in the financial technology peer-to-peer lending business. P2P lending, which matches people seeking loans with people who have money to invest, took off in China in 2014 like nowhere else in the world, thanks to pent-up demand for consumer loans and China's ''wait and see'' approach to regulation. But the P2P platform operators couldn't resist using their customers' deposits for their own purposes. The problem was so rampant that when Chinese regulators did step in, they chose to shut down the entire industry in the country. The last P2P lender closed in 2020.\par \par \uc2 Problems with mismanagement of customer funds occur even in advanced economies that enact rules prohibiting it. The American commodities brokerage firm \uc2 MF Global\uc2  failed in 2011 after diverting customer funds to cover losses made by the chief executive's bond trades. The chief executive was Jon Corzine -- a former head of \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , who would have been well aware of the rules. (Mr. Corzine said he was unaware that customer money was used.)\par \par \uc2 Those examples show that idle cash, whether in the form of yuan, dollars or lines of code, is the devil's workshop. We say that money burns a hole in your pocket, because most of us can't resist the urge to spend the cash sitting in our wallets. Similarly, idle cash sitting around in any business or financial organization naturally attracts people who want to invest it to make more money (or save their hides). In the case of FTX, there is increasing evidence that Mr. Bankman-Fried diverted customer funds to his crypto hedge fund, \uc2 Alameda Research\uc2 , and made loans to himself and to other employees of the company.\par \par \uc2 Corporations have perennial problems with managers who want to spend their company's extra cash on their pet projects. For the operators of financial institutions, it's incredibly hard to resist the temptation to help themselves to customers' cash balances. If they could simply use the money for a short time, they reason, they could make a nice profit and then return the rest to its rightful owners. No one needs to be the wiser.\par \par \uc2 In this light, Mr. Bankman-Fried's downfall is spectacular and interesting -- especially the revelations about his extreme disorganization -- but really nothing new. He is yet another person in a long line of people who couldn't stand to see all that money idly sitting by.\par \par \uc2 FTX was supposed to be the best of the crypto exchanges. Mr. Bankman-Fried said he intended to give his fortune to effective altruist causes and was known as one of the few exchange C.E.O.s actively calling for better regulation of crypto. If he couldn't resist the temptation to treat customers' funds like his personal piggy bank, it seems likely that other crypto exchanges might be doing the same thing.\par \par \uc2 Many crypto exchanges, such as \uc2 Binance\uc2 , are already on regulators' radar screens for possibly selling unregistered securities or potentially dangerous investment products. On top of the hacking attacks that steal millions of dollars from crypto investors and the rug-pulls and other outright fraud taking place in the creation of new cryptocurrencies, crypto investors now realize their money can be lost the old-fashioned way, too.\par \par \uc2 Values of cryptocurrencies, and their exchanges, are reflecting investors' jitters. The price of Binance Coin, a proxy for the value of the Binance exchange, has declined by nearly 25 percent since the FTX debacle. Trading volumes on nearly all major cryptocurrency exchanges are down, as are other cryptocurrency prices.\par \par \uc2 The danger that managers will gamble with their customers' money explains why most countries require brokerages, exchanges and similar financial institutions that accept deposits from customers to separate their customers' money from the company's money, and prohibit them from using their customers' money for any purpose other than to make purchases expressly ordered by their customers. In the United States, only banks and mutual funds can invest their customers' deposits, and they're highly regulated.\par \par \uc2 The best hope for crypto is that exchanges agree to be regulated by the same basic rules that apply to other brokerages and exchanges regarding segregation and usage of customer funds. Some crypto advocates believe that they can use ''smart contracts'' that execute themselves automatically without human intervention and other decentralized, automated protocols to ensure that customers' funds aren't misappropriated. These innovations would be a welcome improvement. But the first step is to adopt the rules and regulations that these protocols would then carry out. Crypto exchanges also need to be transparent about their dealings, their holdings and their transactions so that regulators can easily monitor their activities and enforce these rules.\par \par \uc2 For many, the lessons from the collapse of FTX are clear: There's something deeply wrong with cryptocurrency that makes it too dangerous to be included in the mainstream of finance. And the people operating cryptocurrency systems and the exchanges where cryptocurrencies are bought and sold are crooks, not visionaries.\par \par \uc2 Neither of these conclusions is correct. FTX's collapse had very little to do with either the characteristics of cryptocurrency in general, or the specific features of the coins that FTX minted and distributed. FTX failed because the people who ran the company didn't follow some basic rules of finance that can be difficult to enforce even in well-regulated markets.\par \par \uc2 And \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  is neither a visionary nor a criminal mastermind. He is a human who made the same poor choice that generations of money managers have made before him.\par \par \uc2 Connel Fullenkamp is Professor of the Practice of Economics at \uc2 Duke University\uc2 .

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 How do you make a multibillion-dollar company disappear in a week? For \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2  and his crypto exchange FTX, the simple answer is that a leaked balance sheet leads your biggest rival, himself under federal scrutiny, to instigate a sort of ''bank run'' you cannot possibly cover, exposing billions of dollars in shortfalls you apparently created by riskily investing money that wasn't yours. And revealing yourself, in the process, to be a very new kind of financial villain -- one who pitches not just the prospect of profit but also deliverance from the corrupt speculative system in which you ''made'' your ''billions.''\par \par \uc2 But if S.B.F. was just a meme stock -- his cultural capital inflated by our collective desire to see his profile grow -- what exactly was the meme?\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency is little more than a decade old, and yet it has passed through several reputational phases: first, as the lawless province of black marketeers and hard-core libertarians obsessed with escaping government oversight; then as a speculative market in which many of those people made an astonishing and enviable amount of money; then as an investment sector for adventurous normies who might previously have turned to simple day-trading; then as an ''asset class'' eyed by big-money investors and establishment banks. It was only at the start of last year's N.F.L. season that Matt Damon, unknowingly standing on the precipice of a coming ''crypto winter'' in which the value of Bitcoin fell by two-thirds, endorsed Crypto.com and reminded millions of Americans that ''fortune favors the brave.''\par \par \uc2 The gold-rush phase for cryptocurrency is over now -- with the FTX collapse punctuating that crypto winter, a Christmas of malfeasance. The death of FTX has been called crypto's ''Lehman moment,'' but it was not the first such collapse -- it follows the implosions of Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, Terra and Luna, among many others. But it's fitting that Bankman-Fried will now always be remembered as this crypto crash's central figure, because he postured as someone who could rewrite not just the rules of the financial system but its morality as well. To investors and legislators, he looked like the potential face of a new era for crypto, poised to legitimize through transparency and regulation what had always been an enormously shady, if often quite lucrative, sector. To progressives, he looked like our kind of oligarch, a sort of boy wonder who seemed capable of conjuring up world-changing billions guiltlessly, effectively out of thin air.\par \par \uc2 And he had promised to give that magic internet money away just as quickly: to Democrats, for whom he was the second-largest donor in the midterm cycle and to whom he had casually promised as much as $1 billion by 2024; to pandemic-prevention policy work; to journalistic start-ups and a whole host of causes affiliated with ''effective altruism,'' a movement devoted to doing maximal good in the world. In just three years after its founding, FTX grew from zero to a $32 billion valuation and along the way seemed to provide every progressive millennial a potential sugar daddy.\par \par \uc2 This was a fantasy, as anyone looking closely at the time could have told you. But it was very tempting to believe, and nobody was trying to look all that closely, it turns out -- not the editors who put him on the covers of Forbes and Fortune; not the traders who trusted him with billions in daily trading volume; not the recipients of his philanthropic pledges, many of which will now go unfulfilled; and most conspicuously, not the investors who handed him millions without seeming to even bother checking the books.\par \par \uc2 As recently as July 2021, FTX raised $900 million from, among others, Sequoia Capital, \uc2 Daniel Loeb\uc2 's Third Point and SoftBank Vision Fund, which had previously written down billions of dollars in investments in \uc2 Uber\uc2  and \uc2 WeWork\uc2 . In January, a Series C round raised an additional $400 million. How superficially did they all review their investments, many of which ran into the hundreds of millions of dollars? In a now-legendary profile published on the \uc2 Sequoia\uc2  website just weeks before the collapse, almost every paragraph contained what should have been a red flag but was presented instead as a mark of Bankman-Fried's special genius -- and \uc2 Sequoia\uc2 's, for endorsing it. When, in a pitch meeting, Bankman-Fried describes his vision for FTX as a market for everything up to and including bananas, while participating in a League of Legends video game ''gank'' (short for gang killing) in another window, the assembled investors go nuts: ''I LOVE THIS FOUNDER,'' one types in the Zoom chat. ''10 OUT OF 10!'' another taps. What stage of capitalism is this?\par \par \uc2 Six months ago, Bankman-Fried looked to the outside world like some mix of \uc2 George Soros\uc2  and \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2 , Laurene Powell Jobs and Leonard Leo. Now the comparisons are less flattering: to Bernie Madoff, of course, and to \uc2 Elizabeth Holmes\uc2  of \uc2 Theranos\uc2 , even though Bankman-Fried has not been charged with any crimes; also to \uc2 Adam Neumann\uc2  of \uc2 WeWork\uc2 , \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2  of \uc2 Uber\uc2  and the other iconic start-up hucksters of this strange venture-capital era. But those founders were, for all their delusions and sociopathy, pitch-deck visionaries -- persuasive proselytizers for not just new products but whole new worlds that could be simply invested into being.\par \par \uc2 In his self-presentation, Bankman-Fried seemed to be pitching something else: an outward indifference approaching disdain. His serious-seeming commitment to effective altruism underlined the impression: If he was earning his billions only to donate them, he represented a very different case study in the morality or moral potential of unregulated markets. When, in an interview on the Bloomberg podcast ''Odd Lots'' this spring, he flatly described the crypto markets as pointless speculation bordering on fraud -- one of the interviewers paraphrased Bankman-Fried's summary as ''I'm in the Ponzi business, and it's pretty good'' -- it wasn't a misstep. It was part of his DGAF brand, like the unkempt hair and cargo shorts he wore onstage alongside Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. You might remember someone like him from your college dorm, but in the world of big money he was a genuinely new archetype: a smugly superior Gen X slacker and an entitled, world-changing millennial at once. In his first interview since stepping aside at FTX, he told The Times's David Yaffe-Bellany, casually, ''It could be worse.''\par \par \uc2 For many months, this seeming indifference served to distinguish Bankman-Fried as crypto's good guy. But in the weeks since the FTX collapse, it has also been the source of a lot of reflection and debate, about whether it had been at all reasonable to treat what made him distinct as a basis for lionization. He said in the Sequoia profile, for instance, that no book was ever really worth reading, and he told the economist Tyler Cowen in a podcast interview that faced with a coin-flip game in which half the time he'd double the value of the world and half the time he'd destroy it, he'd choose to play again and again. The venture capitalist \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2  offered a philosophical rejoinder on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''Utilitarianism is bad,'' he wrote. ''It encourages mortal men to play God at levels of complexity that they can't possibly comprehend. It should be banned for the greater good.''\par \par \uc2 Andreessen's venture-capital firm, meanwhile, is among the biggest players in the Web3 world, its signature crypto fund down 40 percent earlier this year. The contagion probably can't be quarantined to the figure of Bankman-Fried or his worldview -- because what he revealed himself to be wasn't a singular bad actor but a representative one. \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  technology may well offer meaningful uses for the wider world in the future, but as of now, it is most significant as the basis for a realm of pure and unregulated speculation.\par \par \uc2 The volatility was not some deep secret only now revealed. It's an almost inescapable aspect of a financial subculture erected outside the oversight and control of the law on the principle that they weren't necessary. And while the broader impact of \uc2 Sam Bankman-Fried\uc2 's undoing isn't yet entirely clear, the early shakeout has been surprisingly limited: The world's second-largest crypto exchange has gone belly-up, but the crypto market as a whole is down by only about 20 percent. For many speculators, it seems, collapses like these were already priced in.\par \par \uc2 David Wallace-Wells (@dwallacewells), a writer for Opinion and a columnist for The New York Times Magazine, is the author of ''The Uninhabitable Earth.''\par \par \uc2 This article appeared in print on page MM12, MM14. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020221127eibr00036\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Other partners include the City of Miami Beach, the Office of Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), which is responsible for the 15-acre master plan, and players in the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  universe like Aorist, a digital art platform, and Decentraland, a 3-D virtual world.\par \par \uc2 The city recently approved a $5 million bond issue to help finance the ReefLine (ranking it on par with Miami Beach's most significant cultural institutions, like the New World Symphony and Bass Museum), and the first and second phases of the project are supposed to start construction in early 2023.\par \par \uc2 ''The ReefLine is a manifestation of all the spheres I care most about,'' Ms. Caminos said. ''It's art as a tool for change. It's sustainable. It's informed by science and technology. And above all, it's participatory, free and open to the public.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Caminos shared the concept behind the ReefLine, how technology and art can come together, and what has kept her pushing forward. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\par \par \uc2 How did the ReefLine come about?\par \par \uc2 The idea grew out of a conversation I had with the marine biologist Colin Foord, the founder of Coral Morphologic, about how artificial reefs could be used to restore and protect Miami Beach's marine ecosystem, which is disappearing along with the area's natural coral reefs. It got me thinking about how we could unite art and science to create sustainable change. Colin and I ended up putting together a grant proposal for the Knight Foundation Arts Challenge Award, which looks for really out-of-the-box ideas, and we won. That gave us the seed money to start bringing the idea to life.\par \par \uc2 What is the ReefLine supposed to do?\par \par \uc2 Most people don't know that after water, concrete is the second most commonly used material on earth, and its production accounts for 8 percent of all global carbon emissions. I wanted to build something that would help capture the three-billion-plus tons of carbon being dumped into the atmosphere each year and serve as an example for other cities.\par \par \uc2 For the ReefLine, the British artist Petroc Sesti developed an entirely new art medium called Carbon Xinc -- a zero-cement geopolymer concrete with mineralized carbon dioxide gas that captures carbon destined for the atmosphere and stores it for an indefinite amount of time.\par \par \uc2 In terms of biodiversity, there is very little habitat left for reef species to live and propagate. The ReefLine will be public housing for fish with tons of nooks and crannies for life to grow and thrive. We're working in conjunction with marine biologists and field experts who will test the site for coral resiliency, to learn what strengthens a coral's ability to survive and recover from environmental stressors, and there will be plenty of community programs for those who want to help scientists monitor fish populations, or outplant coral fragments cultivated in coral nurseries onto specific sections of the ReefLine.\par \par \uc2 You're working with some heavy-hitting creative talent. What can we expect from the design?\par \par \uc2 After we won the grant, I called the architect Shohei Shigematsu, of OMA, to do the master plan. We've worked together before and I knew his genius would take this project to the next level. The first installation, which we tested in the \uc2 University of Miami\uc2 's hurricane simulator, will be sunk 600 feet off the coast of Fourth Street. We commissioned the Argentine artist Leandro Erlich to create a site-specific work with 22 life-size Carbon Xinc car sculptures submerged about 20 feet underwater. The artwork serves as a cautionary tale of what will happen to our coastal cities if we don't address global warming. It also takes this modern symbol of carbon emissions and turns it into a carbon sink that will be colonized by marine life, which is just amazing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Sesti is using laser-scanning techniques to create a work entitled ''Heart of Okeanos,'' a five-foot Carbon Xinc sculpture of a blue whale heart inspired by a real-life 400-pound specimen preserved by scientists after it washed ashore in Canada in 2014. We plan to unveil the artwork during Art Week this December before symbolically returning it back to the ocean.\par \par \uc2 The installations will be connected by a snorkel trail made from OMA-designed shapes that fit together like Legos and act as a coral topiary. For future installations, we have a bucket list of artists we'd love to work with, and we plan to have open calls and public competitions to ensure everyone's ideas are represented.\par \par \uc2 In addition to innovative materials, how is technology playing a critical role in the development of the ReefLine?\par \par \uc2 During Art Week last year, BlueLab Preservation Society partnered with Aorist and the artist Refik Anadol, who created an NFT art collection of wildly colorful A.I. data sculptures inspired by the ReefLine. A portion of the NFT sales went to the ReefLine. This year, we're partnering again with Aorist, as well as the London-based art collective and collaborative studio Random International. I also just applied for a grant to create an augmented reality iteration of the ReefLine, so people can use their phones to see digital depictions of the underwater art installations from the beach with details about the artists and aquatic species living there. And with Decentraland we are building a ReefLine in the metaverse so people can adopt a virtual coral with cryptocurrency, which is great for raising awareness of environmental issues.\par \par \uc2 What do you hope the ReefLine will accomplish?\par \par \uc2 This project is a gargantuan undertaking, and there have been times when I've hesitated because it feels like a herculean task. But I had the good fortune of meeting the ocean conservationist Dr. Sylvia Earle -- ''Her Royal Deepness!'' -- at the Aspen Climate Ideas Summit. At first she was skeptical about what we're doing, but after reviewing all the research and talking to the field experts, she publicly affirmed she was in favor of the project because we're rebuilding what was once there, and it's a model that can inspire and be replicated by others. That really gave me the courage and strength to keep going.\par \par \uc2 I hope the ReefLine will start a global conversation about restoring the health of our oceans and convince people that they can make a difference. There's no better place to do that than underwater in Miami Beach, ground zero of climate change.\par \par \uc2 Follow New York Times Travel on \uc2 Instagram\uc2  , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  .

\par\par \uc2 DEALBOOK NEWSLETTER\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 3 Questions Rise to Top In FTX Crash\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 1,433 \uc2 words\par \uc2 21 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The dramatic collapse of the crypto exchange continues to reverberate throughout the industry.\par \par \uc2 The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offer a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don't already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here .\par \par \uc2 Sam Bankman\uc2 -Fried's crypto empire, FTX, was an epic mess, and the unwinding is likely to last longer than the empire itself.\par \par \uc2 Crypto companies, investors and government officials who heard policy pitches and pocketed political donations from the FTX founder, known as S.B.F., are reeling. The \uc2 Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan\uc2  said on Thursday that it was writing down a $95 million investment in FTX. \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , the only publicly listed crypto exchange in the United States, has seen stock and bond prices descend as the digital asset industry struggles. And crypto values, which fell dramatically over the summer, dropped further.\par \par \uc2 FTX is not your average failed company. John Ray, who handled \uc2 Enron\uc2 's bankruptcy and was named chief executive of FTX when it filed for Chapter 11 protection, said that he had found very little documentation of finances and that what did exist couldn't be trusted. He told the Bankruptcy Court that he had never seen a situation as chaotic as what he was running into at FTX.\par \par \uc2 More than 100 affiliated companies are filing for bankruptcy with FTX. A million or more creditors could line up. The situation is so dire that FTX has already said it doesn't know who its top creditors are or where many assets can be found.\par \par \uc2 At this stage, there are many more questions than there are answers about what the reverberations of FTX's collapse will look like. Here are three of the biggest.\par \par \uc2 Who is next?\par \par \uc2 Crypto companies are deeply intertwined -- they invest in one another, buy one another's tokens and lend tokens and capital to one another -- which means the collapse of FTX could continue to topple others.\par \par \uc2 ''Many trading firms will be wiped out and shut down,'' the crypto venture firm Multicoin Capital told investors in a letter on Thursday, explaining that it had put too much money and trust in FTX.\par \par \uc2 The crypto lender BlockFi, which signed a deal to be rescued by FTX when crypto prices nose-dived over the summer, paused withdrawals last week and is preparing for a possible bankruptcy. BlockFi said it had ''significant exposure'' to the failed exchange and FTX's trading arm, Alameda Research.\par \par \uc2 Industry insiders expect more firms to follow.\par \par \uc2 Two restructuring advisers told DealBook that Oxygen, a decentralized finance lending and borrowing platform backed by Alameda, was on their watch lists. Oxygen's token is OXY; its total market capitalization, which was about $395 million in January, has fallen to about $2.6 million.\par \par \uc2 Genesis Global Capital, one of the largest lenders in the crypto space, suspended withdrawals and new loans on Wednesday. \uc2 Genesis\uc2 , which may have lost as much as $175 million in the FTX collapse, is struggling to pay back creditors who have asked for their money back. A spokesperson for \uc2 Genesis\uc2  said that its nonlending businesses were operating without problems, and that it was ''shoring up the necessary liquidity'' it needed to operate.\par \par \uc2 Genesis\uc2  is connected to many other firms. Its parent, \uc2 Digital Currency Group\uc2 , owns the publication CoinDesk and the investment firm Grayscale, a substantial crypto holder, among other entities.\par \par \uc2 Is S.B.F. going to prison?\par \par \uc2 ''That's the million-dollar question. Everything is on the table,'' said Joe Rotunda, director of the enforcement division of the \uc2 Texas State Securities Board\uc2 , which began investigating FTX before its collapse.\par \par \uc2 The complexity of the international FTX empire, messy record keeping, unreliable statements and the anonymous nature of transactions on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  complicate matters for investigators and prosecutors building cases. They need to do forensic audits and resolve jurisdictional issues.\par \par \uc2 ''Bad investments don't necessarily mean prison. The big one is fraud. That's the big hammer.'' Mr. Rotunda said. ''Concealing or lying. Words and conduct. There's a duty to truthfully disclose.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bankman-Fried also faces civil litigation from big backers and venture capitalists, who began developing strategy with lawyers before the bankruptcy (and expect to face claims themselves from their limited partners), as well as small investors.\par \par \uc2 Prosecutors will have to establish a physical tie between the company and harm in the United States for each charge -- to the extent investors in the United States were defrauded, that would establish jurisdiction, Mr. Rotunda said. In Texas, the most severe securities law frauds are subject to a life term in prison, and his agency works with prosecutors to pursue those charges, just as the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission jointly prosecute and are investigating Bankman-Fried now.\par \par \uc2 ''The civil suits will come before the criminal suits,'' said Paul Foley, a securities law expert at the law firm Akerman. ''Anyone who invested in FTX would have a lawsuit. But it's a lot more difficult to make a criminal case than a civil case.''\par \par \uc2 Will the FTX collapse prompt more regulation?\par \par \uc2 Congressional committees and executive agencies across Washington were already investigating FTX or are calling for inquiries now. On Friday, the House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy sent a letter to FTX's current and former chief executives requesting information on ''the full scope of harm inflicted upon its investors.'' It followed an August demand inquiring into transparency and fraud on crypto exchanges.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 House Financial Services Committee\uc2  and the Senate Banking Committee have announced hearings on the FTX debacle, which are also likely to address new rules and pending bills. Stablecoins -- cryptocurrencies ostensibly pegged to the value of a dollar -- are the subject of legislation languishing in the Financial Services Committee. The bill, which would ensure that stablecoin issuers were overseen more as banks are, could get a renewed push.\par \par \uc2 The Senate Committee on Agriculture has been working on the bipartisan Digital Commodities Consumer Protection Act, which would give the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  jurisdiction over cryptocurrencies deemed commodities (as opposed to securities) and require exchanges to register with the agency.\par \par \uc2 One complication is that, until recently, Mr. Bankman-Fried did a lot of lobbying in Washington and was a champion of the legislation, testifying before the committee, wielding influence behind the scenes with congressional staff and publishing a related policy statement on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''Anything he has been pushing policywise will be reassessed,'' said Lee Reiners, a financial technology expert at Duke University Law School who was formerly at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Another is that S.B.F. was a major political donor, contributing around $37 million to Democratic candidates in the last election cycle. His co-chief executive, Ryan Salame, was a major Republican donor, giving more than $20 million. In all, FTX executives contributed nearly $72 million to both parties, and the company was strategically bipartisan in its lobbying and government affairs hiring.\par \par \uc2 Politicians on both sides of the aisle are regifting the funds. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, a Democrat who co-sponsored a crypto bill that S.B.F. supported, and Representative \uc2 Kevin Hern\uc2 , Republican of Oklahoma, are among those who said they would donate the funds to charity.\par \par \uc2 But Republicans have seized on the collapse of FTX to call the Biden administration's policies into question. Senator \uc2 Josh Hawley\uc2 , Republican of Missouri said Friday that he was looking into connections between political spending and policy. He sent letters to Attorney General \uc2 Merrick Garland\uc2 ; \uc2 Gary Gensler\uc2 , the chair of the S.E.C.; and \uc2 Rostin Behnam\uc2 , who heads the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , inquiring into correspondence about FTX and the timing of any investigations into the fallen company.\par \par \uc2 ''The fact that this scheme was revealed immediately after the midterm elections raises serious questions about whether federal regulators and law enforcement faced conflicts of interest in identifying, investigating and thwarting the fraudulent scheme,'' Mr. Hawley wrote.\par \par \uc2 Regardless of the politics, the collapse of FTX is likely to spur action. And some crypto companies that see regulation as key to legitimacy would welcome it.\par \par \uc2 ''Concerns regulators have around conflicts of interest and segregation of activity in crypto are real,'' said \uc2 Jeremy Allaire\uc2 , chief executive of the stablecoin issuer Circle.\par \par \uc2 Lauren Hirsch, Stephen Gandel and Joe Rennison contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 What do you think?

\par\par \uc2 THE SHORTLIST\par \uc2 Book Review Desk; SECTBR\par \b \uc2 Which Is More Terrifying: Nature or Other People?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Nicole Flattery \par \uc2 1,099 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 26\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Blair Braverman's SMALL GAME (279 pp., Ecco, $27.99) uses a ''Survivor''-type reality show called ''Civilization'' to pose questions about authenticity, competition and resilience. Unfortunately, the novel often encounters the same problems as the shows it's criticizing: It's repetitive, its shallowness resists any close scrutiny, its surface is too cold and shiny for any depth of feeling.\par \par \uc2 Mara, raised in the Oregon wilderness from the age of 10, now works at Primal Instinct, ''a survival school run by a former \uc2 blockchain\uc2  developer named Bj\u248\'00\'F8rn'' where the wealthy and cosseted go for the ''off-grid'' experience. When ''Civilization'''s casting team arrives to recruit her, Mara tells them, ''I'm not trying to rebuild society. I'm just trying to get out of it.'' Despite her credentials, she has no real interest in proving herself, but the prize money would allow her to leave her dreary boyfriend, who is only interested in the ''aesthetic'' of self-sufficiency (''solar ovens, beehives, a greenhouse made of reclaimed windows from the dump''). Once filming starts, she finds that the terrain in ''Civilization'' is hardly its most dangerous aspect: There are predatory producers, four other ambitious and unpredictable contestants, the eternally watchful eye of the cameras. Which is more uncontrollable and terrifying, nature or other people?\par \par \uc2 In following the life-or-death challenges the contestants face alone in the extreme wilderness (where they're abandoned by the producers), Braverman ably depicts the exploitative aspects of reality TV, how nothing actually transpires the way it's presented to the viewer, how the producers have the final say on who are the heroes and villains. Given the multiple suicides by former contestants on shows like ''The Bachelorette'' and ''Love Island,'' Braverman's book sheds an important light on the awful offscreen costs to those who sacrifice their privacy for our entertainment. The people who tend to succeed on these shows are those who are content to allow themselves to be fictionalized. Ashley, Mara's crush on the show, is a natural: ''It struck Mara that of the four of them, Ashley was making her own story. Performing without pretension, but not self-effacing, either. She walked the line well.''\par \par \uc2 In WHEN WE WERE SISTERS (327 pp., One World, $27), the first novel by the poet and screenwriter Fatimah Asghar, three Pakistani American sisters, all under 10, learn the discomfiting truth that the adults aren't coming to save them. If anything, adulthood in this book is as muddled and lonely as childhood. Noreen, Aisha and the temperamental narrator, Kausar, are orphaned by the violent death of their father in Pennsylvania. An uncle whom they've never met before offers to take them to his home in New Jersey; but it soon becomes clear he is interested only in the checks the orphans bring in, and he abandons them in an apartment to essentially raise themselves. Here, the sisters attempt to make their own kind of domestic happiness.\par \par \uc2 The dynamic among them -- playful, complex, unsteady -- is the novel's central appeal. As is Asghar's generosity: A less assured writer wouldn't allow the monstrous uncle gestures of kindness, albeit occasional and muted. However, as the girls grow up and apart, the narrative shift to Kausar's coming-of-age and nascent sexuality feels ploddingly familiar -- her third-grade crush and competition with a prettier and more popular girl for his affections, her first period, the neediness and insecurity that drives these dynamics. This section lacks the energy and intensity of those devoted to the girls' earlier childhoods, which take influence from Justin Torres's wild brotherhood novel ''We the Animals,'' which Asghar cites in her acknowledgments. Toward the end, I missed the electricity of the three siblings' bond; the conclusion feels comparatively rushed, and somewhat incomplete.\par \par \uc2 Asghar's fragmented writing style is distinctive, but her lyricism also serves to mask commonplace observations. Several sentences left me confused (''All my me's pour out of my main me. My main me bleeds me's. My main me too torn to even notice''). Still, Asghar's book has a sweetness at its core that keeps the story alive on the page.\par \par \uc2 In Ray Nayler's exceedingly ambitious THE MOUNTAIN IN THE SEA (456 pp., Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28), another kind of orphan attempts to unravel the mystery of their existence -- and also, with more difficulty, that of all life on earth. Evrim is an android whose job is to aid Dr. Ha Nguyen, a marine biologist, in the search for a society of octopuses in Vietnam's Con Dao archipelago that are exhibiting signs of extraordinary intelligence. In this unsettlingly relatable world, DIANIMA, an international tech company attempting to capitalize on Nguyen's research, stands in for, well, all rapacious tech companies. The dystopia Nayler captures is resolutely believable: Poorly paid workers with no time for real attachments are in ''pseudo-relationships'' with computer-generated ''constructs'' who become humans' reflections without the challenges or rewards of actual intimacy; megalomaniacs cheerfully colonize every corner of the world; and technological advances are relentlessly pursued without any thought of the human consequences.\par \par \uc2 Nayler's best invention, Evrim, is also his most familiar: a character fighting for the right to their own consciousness. Nayler imbues this science fiction trope -- ''a fake so sophisticated it has fooled itself into thinking it is real'' -- with warmth and personality.\par \par \uc2 The problems that afflict ''The Mountain in the Sea'' are a consequence not of its premise, but of its scope and magnitude: information dumping, the occasional explanatory monologue, story lines that are only tangentially connected to the main arc, and lack the same level of interest.\par \par \uc2 Regardless, Nayler's charm lies in his belief in the very human qualities of attentiveness and self-doubt. The result is a novel that is alert, intelligent, open. At a time when we are oversaturated with dystopian narratives, Nayler's distinguishes itself by being almost devoid of cynicism. The only unforgivable sin here is indifference. ''The Mountain in the Sea'' suggests all our apocalyptic fantasies are only fantasies. We're not afraid the world will end -- we're afraid it won't, and that we will finally have to deal with the consequences of our own destruction.\par \par \uc2 Nicole Flattery is the author of the story collection ''Show Them a Good Time'' and a forthcoming novel, ''Nothing Special.'' Her work has appeared in The London Review of Books, The Stinging Fly and other publications.\par \par \uc2 This article appeared in print on page BR26. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020221120eibk0002z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 How FTX's Links With Its Sister Firm Ended Up Dooming Both Companies\b0\par\par\uc2 By Matthew Goldstein, Alexandra Stevenson, Maureen Farrell and David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,741 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Alameda Research was \uc2 Sam Bankman\uc2 -Fried's first company. He built FTX partly to help Alameda's trading business. Then things got out of control.\par \par \uc2 In late 2017, \uc2 Sam Bankman\uc2 -Fried, then 25 years old, co-founded Alameda Research, a small trading firm that marked the beginning of his cryptocurrency empire.\par \par \uc2 Now the relationship between Alameda and his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX -- and how the two propped each other up -- is coming under scrutiny as prosecutors and regulators investigate the collapse of one of the best-known trading platforms in the crypto universe.\par \par \uc2 Alameda's need for funds to run its trading business was a big reason Mr. Bankman-Fried created FTX in 2019. But the way the two entities were set up meant that trouble in one unit shook up the other as crypto prices began to drop in the spring. In the end, it brought down both Alameda and FTX, leading to billions of dollars in losses for customers and traders.\par \par \uc2 And although the collapse echoed past calamities on Wall Street, the lack of regulatory oversight -- coupled with an ambitious start-up founder flush with venture capital money and few internal controls -- meant that there were few parallels.\par \par \uc2 John Jay Ray, III, a prominent restructuring lawyer handling the cleanup of FTX, called the situation ''unprecedented'' in a U.S. bankruptcy court filing on Thursday. He blasted the company for the ''concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bankman-Fried co-founded Alameda in Berkeley, Calif. His scrappy team of traders in their 20s worked around the clock, showering in the locker room of the gym of the four-story building where Alameda had its headquarters. He soon moved the firm to Hong Kong, which had been wooing crypto traders and imposed little oversight on the nascent industry.\par \par \uc2 The main way that Alameda made money was straightforward: It bought Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in one part of the world and sold them in another, pocketing the difference.\par \par \uc2 Alameda's methods borrowed many aspects from traditional high finance. It was a quantitative trading firm, similar to Wall Street hedge funds that use mathematical models and data to inform decisions. It used ''leverage'' -- or borrowed money -- to fuel its trades and make bigger returns. And its Bitcoin trade was a so-called arbitrage trade, also popular on Wall Street.\par \par \uc2 But while Wall Street firms operate within guardrails that limit risk-taking and require regular financial disclosures, Alameda had no regulatory oversight.\par \par \uc2 The firm initially managed around $55 million -- a pittance in the financial world. Its capital came from a mix of the group's own funds and high-interest cryptocurrency loans from wealthy investors, according to a 2018 firm presentation viewed by \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  and people briefed on the firm's operations. In recent years, Alameda struck bigger financing agreements with other crypto trading firms, the people said.\par \par \uc2 In a video posted on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  three years ago, Mr. Bankman-Fried discussed the hectic nature of Alameda's trading. Seated in front of trading screens, he talked about often having to make split-second decisions on trades.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Eventually, as more sophisticated investors like hedge funds piled into the crypto arbitrage trade, it became much less lucrative for Alameda. Still, with the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies soaring -- and expected to keep going up -- Alameda had no trouble paying back its loans in either dollars or crypto.\par \par \uc2 That's why, in the presentation to investors, Alameda was able to say it could offer lenders ''high returns with no risk'' and ''no downside.'' However, finding a ready supply of dependable lenders was time-consuming for Alameda, especially since banks and traditional Wall Street firms largely shunned crypto because of the lack of regulation and oversight.\par \par \uc2 In 2019, Mr. Bankman-Fried hit upon an idea: Why not build a cryptocurrency exchange that could bring in revenue to help fund Alameda's activities?\par \par \uc2 FTX was born. It moved from Hong Kong to the Bahamas, where Mr. Bankman-Fried built his base of operations, and the exchange took off. In financial presentations to investors, the company claimed in 2021 that it was raking in $1 billion in annual revenue by charging fees to customers who wanted to trade cryptocurrencies on its platform. It marketed itself aggressively to ordinary investors eager to trade the hot new thing.\par \par \uc2 With crypto exchanges proliferating, their owners, including Mr. Bankman-Fried, sought more ways to make profit. One way was for an exchange to invent a token for use on its platform. Customers can trade cryptocurrencies directly or by using these tokens; if they use the tokens, typically the exchange offers a trading discount.\par \par \uc2 As long as customers used them to trade cryptocurrencies, the tokens could be quite valuable.\par \par \uc2 FTX called its token FTT and sought ''seed'' money from investors to get trading going. To maintain the value of FTT and keep its price stable, Alameda, still based in Hong Kong, served as the token's main market maker. That meant it bought and sold the majority of FTT on the exchange and, as a major trader, had the ability to set prices for the token.\par \par \uc2 As investors, enticed by the trading discounts, embraced FTT to trade on FTX, the newly minted token became one of the biggest sources of trading revenue for the exchange.\par \par \uc2 Both FTX and Alameda benefited from the token's rising value. The exchange began using FTT to make dozens of investments worth billions of dollars in other crypto companies. A 2019 investor presentation for the new exchange said, ''FTT will be the backbone of the growing FTX ecosystem,'' and promised investors and customers ''guaranteed liquidity,'' or the ability to always get back their money.\par \par \uc2 In the presentation, a cartoon avatar of mop-topped Mr. Bankman-Fried gave a thumbs up and simply said: ''So easy!''\par \par \uc2 At the same time, Alameda, which held a large stake in the token, began using its FTT holdings as collateral for more loans to facilitate its trading activities. As of Sept. 30, Alameda had roughly $13 billion in assets, according to Thursday's bankruptcy filings, although Mr. Ray, the restructuring lawyer and newly appointed chief executive, said he had no confidence in the numbers.\par \par \uc2 The intertwined business model, with FTT propping up the two entities, turned Mr. Bankman-Fried into a crypto hero. Even if many backers and supporters of the exchange didn't quite understand how it all worked, they were taken in by his compelling pitch. He styled himself as an idiosyncratic genius willing to engage with regulators and call out the scams plaguing the crypto industry. He also expressed a commitment to give away much of his wealth to charity.\par \par \uc2 In 2021 and early this year, FTX raised nearly $2 billion in equity from more than two dozen high-profile investors, including Sequoia Capital, SoftBank, Tiger Global and \uc2 BlackRock\uc2 . Some of those investors have since said they were blindsided by FTX's implosion, partly because they didn't fully appreciate the symbiotic relationship between FTX and Alameda, or the potential conflicts of interest that it could pose.\par \par \uc2 For instance, one of the co-chief executives of Alameda, Caroline Ellison, was at times in a romantic relationship with Mr. Bankman-Fried. The two met while working at Jane Street Capital, a New York trading firm, before Alameda opened for business.\par \par \uc2 Critics pointed to other potential conflicts. Alameda traded heavily on FTX and sometimes profited when other customers lost money. Mr. Bankman-Fried had a hand in Alameda's big trading decisions as well as its venture investments, two people familiar with the companies said.\par \par \uc2 In the bankruptcy filing on Thursday, Mr. Ray said there had been an ''absence of independent governance.'' He also said he was not aware that any of Alameda's financial statements had been audited.\par \par \uc2 The lack of transparency and regulation of Mr. Bankman-Fried's businesses should have been a bright red flag early on, said Tyler Gellasch, president of the Healthy Markets Association, an advocate for greater transparency in financial markets.\par \par \uc2 ''This catastrophe with FTX was enabled by two things: It was crypto, and it wasn't public in any fashion,'' Mr. Gellasch said. ''It wasn't a public company, so there were no robust disclosures. They were able to raise billions without public disclosure and without serious accountability.''\par \par \uc2 With the influx of investor money, Mr. Bankman-Fried started a giant publicity campaign for FTX, signing branding deals with sports leagues, advertising on television and hiring celebrities to endorse its platform and woo retail investors. At the same time, Alameda and FTX stepped up their ambitions, providing billions in early-stage funding to 246 crypto companies, according to PitchBook, a data company.\par \par \uc2 It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment when Mr. Bankman-Fried's empire began to spiral out of control, or whether a particular event precipitated it. Early this year, some lenders to Alameda wanted their funds back because they were concerned about the more than $2 billion that Alameda had invested in crypto start-ups.\par \par \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 .com, a leading seller of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, closed out a loan it had made to Alameda, concerned about ''too many illiquid-related assets'' on its balance sheet, a person with knowledge of the matter said.\par \par \uc2 But the problems cascaded this spring when the crypto market began to teeter, with a number of high-profile failures of companies that FTX had close ties to.\par \par \uc2 With crypto prices falling, more lenders wanted their money back. The falling prices also reduced the value of FTT, which Alameda had used as collateral for some loans. As the firm struggled to pay lenders back, FTX resorted to using funds that customers had deposited with the exchange for ease of trading to pay Alameda's lenders back.\par \par \uc2 In an interview with The Times early this week, Mr. Bankman-Fried dodged questions about customer funds. But the amount of customer dollars lent to Alameda could exceed $10 billion.\par \par \uc2 The SoftBank logo above a street in Tokyo. The company was one of the high-profile investors in FTX.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Chief Tapped to Clean Up FTX Calls Mess Worst He's Ever Seen\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,190 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ''This situation is unprecedented,'' said John J. Ray III, who helped manage \uc2 Enron\uc2  after its collapse in an accounting fraud scandal in 2001.\par \par \uc2 John Jay Ray III helped manage the aftermath of some of the largest corporate failures in history, including the implosion of the energy trading firm \uc2 Enron\uc2  after an accounting fraud scandal in 2001.\par \par \uc2 But the corporate dysfunction at FTX, the collapsed cryptocurrency exchange that he took over last week, is the worst he has ever seen.\par \par \uc2 In a blistering court filing on Thursday, Mr. Ray described an astonishing level of disarray and said he had never seen ''such a complete failure of corporate control.'' He listed a series of ''unacceptable management practices,'' including the use of an unsecured group email for access to sensitive data, and said the financial information maintained by FTX was deeply untrustworthy.\par \par \uc2 ''From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented,'' he wrote in the filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware.\par \par \uc2 FTX collapsed last week after a run on deposits exposed a deep financial hole in the business. Last Friday, the company filed for bankruptcy, and its chief executive, \uc2 Sam Bankman\uc2  -Fried, resigned. The collapse has kicked off investigations by the Justice Department and the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  focused on whether FTX improperly used customer funds to prop up Alameda Research, a trading firm that Mr. Bankman-Fried also founded.\par \par \uc2 The collapse has jeopardized the savings of hundreds of thousands of customers who deposited their crypto holdings on the FTX platform. FTX had a wide reach across cryptocurrency companies, and its collapse has sent shock waves through the industry. Last week, the crypto lender BlockFi -- a firm that was closely linked to Mr. Bankman-Fried's crypto empire -- said that it was suspending operations. On Wednesday, the crypto firm \uc2 Genesis\uc2  announced that its own lending arm was halting withdrawals.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Bankman-Fried did not respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The bankruptcy filing on Thursday offered the first detailed look at FTX's business. And it describes a level of dysfunction that goes beyond even some of the most pessimistic assessments offered over the last week and a half.\par \par \uc2 In rich detail, Mr. Ray walked through the company's many corporate missteps and suspicious management, including the use of software to ''conceal the misuse of customer funds.'' He said there was ''an absence of independent governance'' between FTX and Alameda, which was owned almost entirely by Mr. Bankman-Fried.\par \par \uc2 He also said he could not trust that financial statements assembled under Mr. Bankman-Fried's leadership were accurate. ''The FTX Group did not keep appropriate books and records, or security controls, with respect to its digital assets,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 Alameda's quarterly financial statements were never audited, he said. But according to financial information in the filing, Alameda made loans totaling about $3.3 billion to Mr. Bankman-Fried and an entity he controls, and about $600 million to two other FTX executives, Nishad Singh and Ryan Salame.\par \par \uc2 Since he took over last week, Mr. Ray said, his team has secured about $740 million worth of cryptocurrency belonging to various parts of FTX's business. But he called that sum ''only a fraction'' of what he hopes to recover, saying the company has hired forensic analysts and \uc2 blockchain\uc2  experts to assist in locating any remaining funds. The run on FTX left the company owing an estimated $8 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.\par \par \uc2 In Mr. Ray's telling, the mismanagement permeated the entire company.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ray said FTX's human resources department was so disorganized that his team had been unable to prepare a complete list of who worked at FTX. And he said corporate funds had been used to buy homes and other personal items for employees and advisers, without proper documentation. Employees would make payment requests through a chat portal, where supervisors approved disbursements using ''personalized emojis,'' the filing said.\par \par \uc2 According to the filing, FTX lacked lasting records of corporate decisions, partly because Mr. Bankman-Fried relied on communications platforms that were set to automatically delete messages after a short time and encouraged employees to use the same applications.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ray, 63, took over FTX last Friday. A veteran of several famous corporate implosions, he has a reputation as something of a turnaround artist -- an executive who specializes in making the most of distressed situations. He's best known for serving as \uc2 Enron\uc2  's chief executive during its bankruptcy and has been involved in a number of other prominent corporate restructurings, earning praise for his dogged efforts to recover funds for creditors.\par \par \uc2 The collapse of FTX was a shocking fall for Mr. Bankman-Fried, who was widely considered one of the most reliable figures in the freewheeling, loosely regulated crypto industry.\par \par \uc2 Once worth as much as $24 billion, Mr. Bankman-Fried became a frequent presence in the halls of Congress, where he testified about the future of the crypto industry and tried to shape legislation governing the industry. He rubbed shoulders with famous actors and athletes, once appearing onstage at a conference in the Bahamas with former President Bill Clinton and Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. He was also a prolific and much-sought-after political donor, contributing more than $5 million to President Biden's 2020 election effort.\par \par \uc2 But after the collapse, a series of damaging revelations about his leadership of FTX have come to light. He relied on a close circle of fellow executives, and sometimes did not share information with key figures at the company. At times, he was in a romantic relationship with Caroline Ellison, the chief executive of Alameda. And he is firmly in the cross hairs of law enforcement and government regulators, raising the prospect of criminal charges and possible prison time.\par \par \uc2 Since resigning, Mr. Bankman-Fried has started to speak more publicly about the collapse of his company. In an interview with \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  on Sunday, he claimed that he had been unaware of how much money Alameda had borrowed from FTX. He expressed deep regrets over his management of the firm. But at other moments, he seemed almost flippant, describing the video game he had been playing during the crisis and outlining a bizarre plan to post a series of cryptic tweets.\par \par \uc2 Later, in a series of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  messages to a reporter at Vox, he said he regretted allowing the company to file for bankruptcy, and added that regulators ''make everything worse.''\par \par \uc2 The filing on Thursday went to great lengths to distance Mr. Ray and the rest of FTX's current leadership from the former chief executive, who is in the Bahamas. ''Mr. Bankman-Fried is not employed by the debtors and does not speak for them,'' the filing said, calling his public statements ''erratic and misleading.''\par \par \uc2 This article appeared in print on page A1, A20. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020221118eibi0003p\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last year, Danny de Hek was a social media guru badly in need of a social media guru. A buoyant New Zealander with geeky glasses, he dispensed advice about how to vastly expand your online audience, to a group of just 350 subscribers.\par \par \uc2 He earned a living by drop shipping electronics as he searched for ways to make serious money. Then, in February, the husband of a friend sent the 52-year-old Mr. de Hek an email crowing about a company that somehow guaranteed outsize and clockwork returns. Investors in what was then known as HyperFund -- it has since been rebranded twice -- could triple their money in 600 days.\par \par \uc2 ''It's the best passive income retirement plan I have ever seen,'' the acquaintance wrote. Get in now then sit back and watch the cash roll in.\par \par \uc2 The message changed Mr. de Hek's life, though not in the way his friend might have hoped. After a few days of looking into HyperFund, Mr. de Hek concluded it was a scam, one that he estimates has attracted at least $1 billion by recruiting thousands of participants, some of whom put up as little as $300 or as much as $50,000 or more.\par \par \uc2 By March, he had crafted a new online identity: crypto Ponzi scheme buster. Mr. de Hek has since denounced HyperFund in more than 130 videos posted to \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , some of them nearly two hours long, lecturing viewers in a style that toggles between goofball and scold.\par \par \uc2 ''When I looked into HyperFund, to me it just seemed black and white,'' Mr. de Hek said during one of several interviews from his home in Christchurch. ''Then I thought, I need to warn people about this.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. de Hek is one of the few voices flagging crypto-based Ponzi schemes, which U.S. investigators say are a severely underpublicized scourge. The past week has shown just how volatile the market is: One of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world, FTX, collapsed and the industry, is in meltdown.\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u338\'01\'52\par \par \uc2 Amid that kind of uncertainty, many investors have decided that if their tokens won't recover from the steep drop in value that began last November, why not take a flier on a company that sounds crypto-adjacent?\par \par \uc2 ''People are desperate, and out of desperation they're giving it a go,'' Mr. de Hek said. ''It's depressing because this is often a last-ditch effort.''\par \par \uc2 A Ponzi scheme, for those in need of a refresher, is an age-old fraud in which inflows of new money pay off earlier investors. Using cryptocurrencies does little more than lend the whole plate-spinning contraption a patina of the cutting edge -- Hey, it's on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  -- and makes it harder to pin down who is in charge. But the story ends the same way: champagne for those at the top, tears for everyone else.\par \par \uc2 U.S. investigators have busted a handful of crypto Ponzis over the years. Among them is \uc2 OneCoin\uc2 , which was based in Bulgaria and which prosecutors allege brought in roughly $4 billion from investors around the world. The charismatic co-founder of that fraud, Ruja Ignatova, disappeared after the fund closed in 2017 and is the subject of an 11-part BBC podcast, ''The Missing Cryptoqueen.''\par \par \uc2 ''We've worked multiple cases that involve more than $1 billion, and those are only the ones we hear about,'' said Jarod Koopman, the acting executive director of the Cyber and Forensic Services section of the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2 , which spearheads crypto-Ponzi investigations, in a phone interview. ''These are traditional Ponzi schemes that have been adapted to the digital landscape, recruiting investors through social media to make them look great. And they're completely bogus.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Koopman would not comment on cases other than those that are already public, and he declined to discuss HyperFund. The company has attracted the attention of regulators in Britain, where the \uc2 Financial Conduct Authority\uc2  has a webpage warning investors to ''be wary of dealing with this unauthorized firm.''\par \par \uc2 Dozens of HyperFund investors have left withering takedowns on the company review site \uc2 Trustpilot\uc2 . One person who said he had lost $10,000 wrote, ''For the love of God -- stay away from this scam.'' A \uc2 Facebook\uc2  page called ''HyperVerse Scam -- Now What!?'' has 6,200 members.\par \par \uc2 ''So that's my money gone,'' read the top comment in mid-October. ''Lesson learned.''\par \par \uc2 To Mr. de Hek, everything about the Hyper empire seems suspicious. On its website and in promotional videos, HyperFund explained that investors could buy ''memberships,'' starting at $300, and earn ''rewards'' that would accrue daily in their account. Those rewards took the form of ''HU,'' the internal trading currency, said to have parity with the U.S. dollar.\par \par \uc2 And why would everyone's HU triple in 600 days? Because the putative founders of HyperFund -- Ryan Xu and Sam Lee, described on promotional sites as a pair of superstar \uc2 blockchain\uc2  entrepreneurs -- were going to pour all that cash into promising and profitable crypto projects, which they claimed would eventually serve 30 million customers. They also said the company would go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\par \par \uc2 It sounded plausible to many. Whoever ran HyperFund exploited the craze for crypto, which to most people at the time was a bafflingly complex technology that seemed to mint millionaires. But HyperFund never went public, and the only product it sold was memberships to HyperFund. Members who recruited new members got a cut of their recruits' rewards, a perennial feature of pyramid schemes and an occasional feature of Ponzis.\par \par \uc2 To Mr. de Hek, this sale of memberships, in the absence of any product, was a blazing red flag that he had seen all too often. Before the pandemic, he had created Elite: Six, a company that hosted twice-a-week, in-person networking meetings for small-business owners in Christchurch. Those who paid $60 a month could introduce themselves and pitch their company. Mr. de Hek vetted every pitch, and in more than a few cases the main product was a joining fee, which earned the right to recruit others and get a cut of their joining fee. And so on.\par \par \uc2 ''They were basically multilevel marketing companies,'' Mr. de Hek said. ''I hate them with a passion. I never let them in.''\par \par \uc2 To understand that passion, and his mission to wipe out crypto Ponzi schemes, you need to know something about Mr. de Hek's childhood. Like everyone in his family, he was raised as a Jehovah's Witness.\par \par \uc2 ''From the age of 5, I was knocking on the doors of strangers, telling them that fires and earthquakes were happening for a reason, that the world was ending soon,'' he recalled, describing being taught that only believers will survive the imminent destruction of earth.\par \par \uc2 He eventually started questioning some of his beliefs, and at 23, when he confessed to a romantic fling -- premarital sex was forbidden -- church elders ''disfellowshipped'' him, as excommunication is called.\par \par \uc2 Only later did Mr. de Hek conclude that he had been raised in a cult. (The church disagrees. ''No, Jehovah's Witnesses are not a cult'' is an answer to a frequently asked question on its website. ''Rather, we are Christians who do our best to follow the example set by Jesus Christ and to live by his teachings.'')\par \par \uc2 To Mr. de Hek, the way that HyperFund investors talked about the company, in chats and on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  videos, was an eerie echo of what he had experienced at a child.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone in the Jehovah's Witnesses loves other members, and it's that sense of community that is the most precious thing to them,'' he said. ''Everyone in those HyperNation Zoom chats keeps talking about how much they love each other. And in both cases, there is no talking anyone out of their faith. For the Witnesses, it's faith in the Bible and in end times. For HyperNation, it's faith in the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Since the end of last year, the HyperFund faithful have been severely tested. In December, the company rechristened itself HyperVerse, an apparent attempt to cash in on the vogue surrounding all things metaverse. (''Open a space factory,'' it says in the Galaxy Pioneer section of the HyperVerse home page.) The internal currency was changed, too; everyone's HU was suddenly called HV.\par \par \uc2 The new packaging didn't solve a larger problem. Last November, Bitcoin began an epic decline, from about $64,000 apiece to roughly $16,000 today. Thousands of other coins are down 95 percent or more. With a crypto winter underway, it seemed impossible for HyperFund or its successors to keep paying rewards if they were truly the fruits of crypto-related investments.\par \par \uc2 By late last year, members had started to howl online that they could not withdraw their rewards. One of them was Mike Lucas, 61, who lives in Paterson, N.J., and spent much of his working life in the shipping department of A.&P. supermarkets. He was introduced to HyperFund through a friend of a friend.\par \par \uc2 ''He'd invested in it, and he said, 'Give it a try,''' Mr. Lucas said in an interview. ''He showed me this chart of how much I'd earn in 600 days if I invested $50,000. Then I looked into Ryan and Sam, and they were real people who did crypto stuff.''\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr. Lucas put $25,000 into HyperFund, all of it from an individual retirement account. A few months ago, when he tried to make his first withdrawal, nothing budged. At first he thought it was a technical problem -- the instructions are fantastically complicated. At some point, he realized that his money was gone.\par \par \uc2 ''I was hoping to use it to spend more time somewhere warmer, rent a place south, maybe North Carolina,'' Mr. Lucas said. ''Those plans are on hold, and I'm furious. At a loss for words.''\par \par \uc2 Over the summer, as the anger mounted, HyperVerse pivoted yet again and became HyperNation. Again, the rules changed. Members could transfer their rewards to the new platform only if they bought one of several bespoke nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, such as a ''purple box,'' which cost $10,000. Large returns were once again promised.\par \par \uc2 In his videos, Mr. de Hek treats all of these and other twists in the Hyper plot with a light touch, one befitting a farce. That's especially true when the topic is Mr. H, a figure who now appears on HyperNation videos as some kind of spokesman, wearing a gold mask and a black hoodie and uttering slogans -- ''HyperNation will be an equal, fair and transparent platform that can solve the pain points of today's society'' -- in a variety of slick studio settings. It's like getting lectured about utopia from a character in ''Squid Game.''\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 Who is actually running HyperNation is a mystery that Mr. de Hek continues to plumb. In September, a man with a British accent named Keith Williams announced in a Zoom call of HyperNation elite -- an insider sent Mr. de Hek a link to the recording -- that he had been named ''by corporate'' as the global head of sales. He didn't identify anyone in corporate, and Mr. de Hek has theorized that Mr. Williams is now in charge.\par \par \uc2 ''Keith Williams has put his neck on the chopping block,'' Mr. de Hek said in an interview. ''Regulators will be looking for him.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Williams could not be reached for comment through his \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  page, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  account or phone numbers in online databases associated with him. He did not respond to emails sent to Future in Safe Hands, a personal coaching company where he is a director, according to Companies House, the \uc2 British government\uc2 's business registrar. One recent evening, a woman at a residence that Companies House listed as Mr. Williams address, in a London suburb, said he was not home and offered to pass along a reporter's business card.\par \par \uc2 In a recent HyperNation video, Mr. Williams described Mr. de Hek as a guy in a cheap suit looking to pay the rent through a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  audience.\par \par \uc2 Mr. de Hek's suit is cheap, he says. But with a mere 2,500 subscribers, his \uc2 YouTube\uc2  audience remains tiny, and so far his labors on that platform have yielded a total of $1,200, after taxes, which works out to pennies per hour.\par \par \uc2 Without that drop-shipping business, he'd struggle. This doesn't seem to bother him, in part because he is a born optimist and thinks this online scam-busting thing could one day catch on. Viewers have sent him dozens of links to likely online Ponzi schemes, and he plans to name and shame them all. If that creates enemies, fine.\par \par \uc2 ''I've already had my life threatened,'' Mr. de Hek said, with a smile. ''My saving grace is that I live in New Zealand. I'm a long way from everyone.''\par \par \uc2 Danny de Hek, top, advised his YouTube viewers that a company once known as HyperFund was fraudulent. He has issued his warnings in more than 130 YouTube videos from his home in New Zealand, above right. A masked figure called Mr. H, above left, appears as a kind of spokesman in videos from the company, now known as HyperNation.

Here's What to Know.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kalley Huang \par \uc2 784 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Binance\uc2  , the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, was set to bail out FTX. Then it pulled out of the deal.\par \par \uc2 When the cryptocurrency market experienced a $2 trillion crash in May, the crypto company FTX offered financial lifelines to several collapsing firms.\par \par \uc2 But this week, FTX needed a bailout, which its rival \uc2 Binance\uc2  seemed on the cusp of delivering. Then \uc2 Binance\uc2  reversed itself, saying it was pulling out of a deal to acquire the company.\par \par \uc2 What are FTX and \uc2 Binance\uc2  ?\par \par \uc2 FTX and \uc2 Binance\uc2  are cryptocurrency exchanges, meaning they enable customers to trade digital currencies for other digital currencies or traditional money, and vice versa. The two exchanges process the majority of all crypto trades in the world, according to CoinMarketCap, an industry data tracker.\par \par \uc2 FTX, one of the world's largest exchanges, is run by \uc2 Sam Bankman\uc2  -Fried and is headquartered in the Bahamas. It has spent millions of dollars lobbying American legislators to institute crypto-friendly regulation.\par \par \uc2 Binance\uc2  , the largest exchange, is run by the billionaire \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2  . The company, which has no official headquarters and largely functions outside of the United States, has been scrutinized for skirting regulatory rules. \uc2 Binance\uc2  was an early investor in FTX.\par \par \uc2 Both companies have built their businesses on risky trading options that are not legal in the United States. They each have smaller American arms, Binance.us and FTX.us, which are separate from their sister companies and are meant to comply with U.S. regulations.\par \par \uc2 The crypto industry has increasingly been the target of regulatory scrutiny on Capitol Hill and across the globe. Mr. Zhao, 45, and Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, have publicly butted heads over how to regulate cryptocurrency -- or whether to do so at all.\par \par \uc2 Why did FTX run into trouble?\par \par \uc2 FTX has a native cryptocurrency token called FTT, which traders use for operations like paying transaction fees. Last year, Mr. Zhao sold his stake in FTX back to Mr. Bankman-Fried, who paid for it partially with FTT tokens.\par \par \uc2 On Nov. 2, the crypto publication CoinDesk reported on a leaked document that appeared to show that Alameda Research, a hedge fund run by Mr. Bankman-Fried, held an unusually large amount of FTT tokens. FTX and Alameda are meant to be separate businesses, but the report claimed that they had close financial ties.\par \par \uc2 Binance\uc2  announced on Nov. 6 that it would sell its FTT tokens ''due to recent revelations.'' In response, FTT's price plummeted and traders rushed to pull out of FTX, fearful that it would be yet another fallen crypto company.\par \par \uc2 FTX scrambled to process requests for withdrawals, which amounted to an estimated $6 billion over three days. It seemed to enter a liquidity crunch, meaning it lacked the money to fulfill requests.\par \par \uc2 How did \uc2 Binance\uc2  intervene?\par \par \uc2 On Tuesday, \uc2 Binance\uc2  said it had reached an agreement to bail out FTX by buying the company. But, Mr. Zhao added in the announcement, ''\uc2 Binance\uc2  has the discretion to pull out from the deal at any time.''\par \par \uc2 In a concurrent announcement, Mr. Bankman-Fried said the deal would protect customers and allow FTX to finish processing their withdrawals. He attempted to dispel rumors of conflict between FTX and \uc2 Binance\uc2  , adding, ''we are in the best of hands.''\par \par \uc2 Why did the deal between \uc2 Binance\uc2  and FTX unravel?\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, \uc2 Binance\uc2  announced it would no longer buy FTX, saying it had arrived at that decision ''as a result of corporate due diligence.'' It also cited regulatory investigations and reports of mishandled funds.\par \par \uc2 ''Every time a major player in an industry fails, retail consumers will suffer,'' \uc2 Binance\uc2  said in a statement. ''We have seen over the last several years that the crypto ecosystem is becoming more resilient and we believe in time that outliers that misuse user funds will be weeded out by the free market.''\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, FTX announced it had reached an agreement with Tron, a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  platform, to swap certain tokens from FTX to other crypto wallets.\par \par \uc2 Why has the FTX situation affected the cryptocurrency market?\par \par \uc2 The cryptocurrency industry has long struggled to convince regulators, investors and ordinary customers that it is trustworthy. The fall of FTX, which seemed more stable than other companies, and the pullout by \uc2 Binance\uc2  have jolted the market.\par \par \uc2 FTT's price has fallen about 80 percent since Tuesday. The prices of Bitcoin and Ether, some of the most valuable tokens, have both fluctuated widely since Tuesday, at one point dropping more than 20 percent.\par \par \uc2 FTX has spent millions of dollars lobbying American legislators to institute crypto-friendly regulation.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Latest Viral Idea Sweeping Silicon Valley: Widespread Layoffs\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erin Griffith \par \uc2 1,281 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Hiring the best, the brightest and the highest number of employees was a badge of honor at tech companies. Not anymore as layoffs surge.\par \par \uc2 When \uc2 Stripe\uc2 , a payments start-up valued at $74 billion, laid off more than 1,000 employees this month, its co-founders blamed themselves. ''We overhired for the world we're in,'' they wrote. ''We were much too optimistic.''\par \par \uc2 After \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's new owner, slashed the company's staffing in half last week, \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , a founder and former chief executive of the social media service, claimed responsibility. ''I grew the company size too quickly,'' he wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 And on Wednesday, when \uc2 Meta\uc2 , the parent company of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , shed 11,000 people, or about 13 percent of its work force, \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 , the chief executive, blamed overzealous expansion. ''I made the decision to significantly increase our investments,'' he wrote in a letter to employees. ''Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected.''\par \par \uc2 The chorus of conceding by tech executives that they hired too many people is ricocheting across Silicon Valley as the industry rushes to make cuts, blaming a worsening economy.\par \par \uc2 But at least part of the surge in layoffs was self-inflicted. When the companies enjoyed soaring profits and a belief that the pandemic-fueled boom times would keep going, they aggressively expanded by hoarding the most fought-over and expensive resource in the software business: talent.\par \par \uc2 Silicon Valley tech companies have long seen hiring as more than just filling openings. The industry's fierce talent wars showed that companies like \uc2 Google\uc2  and \uc2 Meta\uc2  were gaining the best and brightest. Ballooning staffs and a long reign atop lists of the most-desired jobs for college graduates were emblems of growth, deep pockets and prestige. And to employees, the work became something larger -- it was an identity.\par \par \uc2 This mentality became ingrained at the largest tech companies, which offer numerous perks on lavish corporate campuses that rival universities. It was echoed by smaller start-ups, which dangle a chance at life-changing wealth in the form of stock options.\par \par \uc2 Now these practices are giving the tech industry indigestion.\par \par \uc2 ''When times are flush, you get excesses, and excesses lead to overhiring and optimism,'' said \uc2 Josh Wolfe\uc2 , an investor at \uc2 Lux Capital\uc2 . ''For the past 10 years, the abundance of cash led to an abundance of hiring.''\par \par \uc2 More than 100,000 tech workers have lost their jobs this year, according to Layoffs.fyi, a site that tracks layoffs. The cuts range from well-known publicly traded companies like \uc2 Meta\uc2 , \uc2 Salesforce\uc2 , \uc2 Booking.com\uc2  and \uc2 Lyft\uc2  to highly valued private start-ups such as the Gopuff delivery service and the Chime and \uc2 Brex\uc2  financial platforms.\par \par \uc2 Many of the job losses have taken place in tech's most experimental areas. \uc2 Astra\uc2 , a rocket company, cut 16 percent of its staff this week after tripling its head count last year. In the cryptocurrency industry, which has suffered a meltdown this year, high-value companies including Crypto.com, \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 .com, OpenSea and Dapper Labs have cut hundreds of workers in recent months.\par \par \uc2 Tech leaders were too slow to react to signs of an economic slowdown that emerged this spring, after many of the companies had already been on hiring sprees for several years, tech analysts said.\par \par \uc2 Meta\uc2 , whose valuation soared past $1 trillion, doubled its staff to 87,314 people over the past three years. \uc2 Robinhood\uc2 , the stock trading app, expanded its work force nearly sixfold in 2020 and 2021.\par \par \uc2 ''They've charged ahead with these plans that are no longer based on reality,'' said Caitlyn Metteer, director of recruiting at Lever, a provider of recruiting software.\par \par \uc2 For many, it's a moment of shock. ''Are we in a bubble'' panics in the tech industry over the last decade have always been short-lived, followed by a rapid return to even frothier good times. Even those who predicted that pandemic behaviors enabled by the likes of Zoom, Peloton, \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and \uc2 Shopify\uc2  would ebb now say they underestimated the extent.\par \par \uc2 Many believe this downturn will last longer because of the macroeconomic factors that created it. For the past decade, low interest rates pushed investors into riskier assets that offered higher returns. Those investors valued fast growth over profits and rewarded companies that took big risks.\par \par \uc2 In recent years, tech companies responded to the flood of cash from investors and a rapidly growing business by pouring money into expansion via sales and marketing, hiring, acquisitions and experimental projects. The excess capital encouraged companies to staff up, adding fuel to the war for talent.\par \par \uc2 ''The pressure is to just spend the money quick enough so you can grow fast enough to justify the kinds of investments V.C.s want to make,'' said Eric Rachlin, an entrepreneur who co-founded Body Labs, an artificial intelligence software company that \uc2 Amazon\uc2  bought.\par \par \uc2 Expanding head count was also a way for managers to advance their careers. ''Getting more people on the team is easier than telling everyone to just work super hard,'' Mr. Rachlin said.\par \par \uc2 That led the tech industry to gain a reputation for corporate bloat. Rumors often circulated of highly compensated workers who clocked just a few hours of work a day or juggled multiple remote jobs at once, alongside elaborate office perks like free laundry, massages and renowned cafeteria chefs. This spring, \uc2 Meta\uc2  scaled back its perks, including laundry service.\par \par \uc2 In the past, tech workers could quickly change jobs or land on their feet if they were cut because of the plethora of open positions, but ''I don't think we know yet if everyone in this wave of layoffs will be able to do that,'' Mr. Rachlin said.\par \par \uc2 Some people see a chance to help those entering a difficult job market for the first time. Stephen Courson recently left a career in sales and strategy at \uc2 Gartner\uc2 , the research and consulting firm, and \uc2 Salesforce\uc2  to create financial content. He initially planned to focus on time management, but after many of his friends went through painful layoffs he began working on a course that helps people prepare for job interviews. It's a skill that many of today's job hunters never had to hone in flush times.\par \par \uc2 ''This isn't going to get better quickly,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Amid the drumbeat of layoff announcements, investors see an opportunity. They are quick to point out that well-known successes of the last decade -- companies like \uc2 Airbnb\uc2 , \uc2 Uber\uc2 , \uc2 Dropbox\uc2  -- were created in the aftermath of the Great Recession.\par \par \uc2 This week, Day One Ventures, a venture capital firm, announced Funded Not Fired, a program that aims to invest $100,000 into 20 new start-ups where at least one founder was laid off from a tech company. Within 24 hours, hundreds of people had applied, said Masha Bucher, founder of the firm.\par \par \uc2 ''Some of the people are saying, 'This is a sign I've been waiting for,''' she said. ''It really gives people hope.''\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, there may be more layoff announcements -- delivered through the now standard form of a letter from the chief executive posted to a company blog.\par \par \uc2 These letters have taken on a familiar format. The bosses explain the grim economic outlook, citing inflation, ''energy shocks,'' interest rates, ''one of the most challenging real estate markets in 40 years'' or ''probable recession.'' They take the blame for growing too fast. They offer up support to those affected -- severance, visa help, health care, career guidance. They express sadness and thank everyone.\par \par \uc2 And they reaffirm the company's mission.\par \par \uc2 This article appeared in print on page A1, A24. \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020221111eibb00052\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Foreign Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Art Is Put to the Flame In a Bid for NFT Glory\b0\par\par\uc2 By Zachary Small \par \uc2 1,519 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 It's tough to profit in the struggling market of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  assets right now. Burning a purported drawing from \uc2 Frida Kahlo\uc2 's personal diary didn't help a businessman's cause.\par \par \uc2 First came the mariachi band, a flame-juggling dancer and the models in bathing suits and ball gowns sauntering beside the pool of a Miami mansion.\par \par \uc2 Then the spectacle began.\par \par \uc2 A businessman who built his wealth on waves of speculation -- riding the dot-com surge in the 1990s, and then the rapid growth of Bitcoin in recent years -- popped a drawing out of its frame that he heralded as a page from \uc2 Frida Kahlo\uc2 's personal diary.\par \par \uc2 Wearing a sequined blazer with the artist's portrait on his back, he pinned the picture to a martini glass filled with blue rubbing alcohol. It was set aflame, and the artwork was reduced to ashes.\par \par \uc2 Attendees at the opulent July gathering, which was captured in a promotional video, had been notified that the drawing was being ''transformed to live eternally in the digital realm'' through the creation of nonfungible tokens that represented the ''rebirth & immortality of a timeless piece.'' Those who chose to buy an NFT with the Ethereum cryptocurrency were promised exclusive access to events and the assurance that 30 percent of the proceeds would go toward charitable causes.\par \par \uc2 But with his entrance into the murky world of NFTs, the businessman, Martin Mobarak, also generated incredulous headlines and an investigation by the authorities in Mexico, which classifies Kahlo's artworks as national monuments. Some observers doubted that a relatively unknown collector would have access to a rare Kahlo drawing, leading to accusations of fraud.\par \par \uc2 The destruction of ''Fantasmones Siniestros'' (''Sinister Ghosts'') was an example of the high-stakes brinkmanship common in the NFT market, where a 97 percent drop in trading volumes is pushing some to extremes. Selling cryptocurrencies and \uc2 blockchain\uc2  assets has often relied on hype cycles, and Mobarak acknowledged he was looking to stir controversy.\par \par \uc2 ''I had to do something drastic to get attention,'' he said in an extensive interview about the project, which went under the radar until Mexico announced its investigation in late September.\par \par \uc2 After burning the artwork, Mobarak's Frida.NFT company created 10,000 nonfungible tokens of the piece. But only four of the NFTs have been sold, some at a steep discount, according to Etherscan, amounting to less than $11,200 for a piece that Mobarak personally valued at $10 million.\par \par \uc2 ''From one angle, Frida.NFT is a brazen scam; from the other it looks like a crime against art history,'' Ben Davis, who constructed a frame-by-frame analysis of Mobarak's party in Miami for Artnet News, said in an email. ''I am not sure which is worse.''\par \par \uc2 Mobarak said that by selling virtual copies of the Kahlo drawing, which features a surreal parade of animalistic monsters, he was democratizing access to something that had been sitting in a vault.\par \par \uc2 ''If \uc2 Frida Kahlo\uc2  were alive today,'' he said, ''I would bet my life that if I asked to burn a small piece of her diary to bring some smiles and better quality of life to children, then she would say: 'Go ahead and do it. I'll light the fire.'''\par \par \uc2 Although the frenzy around NFTs has subsided since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, when people stuck inside were looking for new outlets to spend money, they continue to allure a smaller number of artists, investors and hucksters.\par \par \uc2 Unlike tangible collectibles like baseball cards, NFTs, which use the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology that publicly tracks ownership and undergirds cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Ethereum, can provide their creator a cut of each sale on the secondary market. They can also be a vessel for discussions about value: Both a Basquiat and a Bored Ape are worth only the price that two parties have agreed on.\par \par \uc2 Destroying an artist's work in the name of crypto is not unprecedented. Last year, an original Banksy was burned during a livestream before an NFT representing the artwork was sold for $380,000. And Damien Hirst has burned millions of dollars worth of art for his ''Currency'' project, in which collectors were forced to decide whether to keep the physical or digital version of his dot paintings.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 But NFTs are a relatively new arena for Mobarak, 57, a Mexican businessman who lives in Miami. His first major business venture came during the 1990s ascent of web companies. After selling one of the first internet service providers in the Anchorage region before the dot-com bubble burst, he reinvented himself as an aircraft tycoon and then developed an interest in prospecting. A potential silver mine in Mexico never turned a profit. Bitcoin did.\par \par \uc2 Mobarak said he used some of that money to purchase the Kahlo drawing from a private collector in 2015, declining to say how much he spent on it or who he bought it from. A provenance report that Mobarak had commissioned by Andr\u233\'00\'E9s Siegel, an art and antiques dealer in Mexico City, stated that a private collector had previously bought the work from a Manhattan gallery called Mary-Anne Martin Fine Art.\par \par \uc2 Martin confirmed to \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  that she had twice sold the work, which the heir of a Venezuelan art critic, Juan R\u246\'00\'F6hl, had received as a gift from Kahlo. She first sold it in 2004 to the Vergel Foundation and then in 2013 to a private collector after it was consigned back by the foundation. It was then part of an exhibition that toured cultural institutions like the High Museum of Art in Atlanta and Scuderie del Quirinale in Rome.\par \par \uc2 Martin said she could not provide the private collector's identity or confirm if the drawing that Mobarak burned in Miami was genuine.\par \par \uc2 A copy of the provenance report posted on the Frida.NFT website says the roughly 9-by-6-inch drawing was made around 1945 with watercolor, crayon, pencil, pen and sepia ink. ''This work corresponds to the characteristics in style and materials used by \uc2 Frida Kahlo\uc2  in her diary housed in La Casa Azul in Coyoac\u225\'00\'E1n, Mexico,'' Siegel wrote. He did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 The artist's works rarely come up for auction, making it difficult to assess their market value, but Kahlo completed about 150 paintings and a number of drawings before her death at 47.\par \par \uc2 If the artwork was indeed authentic, Mobarak could face legal repercussions; the National Institute of Fine Arts and Literature, Mexico's leading cultural authority, acknowledged its investigation but would not comment further. ''The deliberate destruction of an artistic monument constitutes a crime in terms of the federal law on archaeological, artistic and historical monuments and zones,'' the government said in a statement in September.\par \par \uc2 Gregorio Luke, a former Mexican diplomat and a previous director of the Museum of Latin American Art in Long Beach, Calif., said that breaking the Mexican monument law could lead to as much as a decade-long prison sentence and a fine equivalent to the artwork's cost. ''I think this man should be put in jail,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Leila Amineddoleh, a lawyer who specializes in art and cultural heritage law, said that she was not aware of any cases when Mexico had enforced its cultural patrimony laws for the destruction of artworks by Kahlo, but that Mobarak was in a legal conundrum.\par \par \uc2 ''If he did actually burn it, he is breaking one law,'' she said. ''And if he didn't, if it was a reproduction, then he might have violated copyright law. And if he copied the original with an intent to deceive, it could be fraud.''\par \par \uc2 Mobarak, who maintains that the Kahlo drawing was real, said he did not consult a lawyer before deciding to burn the artwork. The idea came to him after he noticed that an auction at \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  drew attention last year when one of Kahlo's final self-portraits became the most expensive work of Latin American art ever sold at auction, at $34.9 million.\par \par \uc2 His event in Miami in July was hastily put together, according to Gabrielle Pelicci, who helped plan the evening with two weeks of notice. Referring to a charitable stunt that went viral on social media in 2014, she said Mobarak had hoped the burning would be like ''the ice bucket challenge, but with fire.''\par \par \uc2 Yet it may be Mobarak's reputation that has been singed. When asked if he wished he had not burned the Kahlo artwork, he took a long pause and sighed. ''I like to say that I don't regret it.''\par \par \uc2 After destroying what he heralded as a drawing by Frida Kahlo, Mr. Mobarak, a businessman, created 10,000 nonfungible tokens of the artwork. ''I had to do something drastic to get attention,'' said Mr. Mobarak, who made much of his money during the dot-com surge in the 1990s.; Martin Mobarak (PHOTOGRAPHS BY J. R.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Republicans Begin a Push for Ballot Watching Ahead of Election Day\b0\par\par\uc2 By Danny Hakim and Alexandra Berzon \par \uc2 1,802 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 November 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Tedium and suspicion mix as skeptical observers monitor the largely monotonous work at a sprawling elections office near Las Vegas.\par \par \uc2 NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- The questions began soon after the doors opened to the public at a sprawling elections office inside a warehouse, and they kept coming until the sky was dark and a cold wind was blowing outside. Hundreds of thousands of ballots for Clark County, which encompasses Las Vegas, are processed, sorted and counted here, against a backdrop of mountains and desert.\par \par \uc2 Because elections in America are more fraught than ever, the scrutiny of ballot counting now starts well before Election Day, and the legal challenges have already begun.\par \par \uc2 The Republican Party and allied groups, many seized by \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2 's falsehoods about fraud in elections, are training monitors around the country to spot what they see as irregularities at absentee ballot counting centers. The monitors are told to take copious notes, which could be useful for potential court challenges, raising the prospect of a replay in state and local elections of Mr. Trump's attempt to use the courts to overturn his loss two years ago.\par \par \uc2 The activity has not produced reports of major disruptions or problems. But on Thursday, local officials were taking no chances at the vote counting center in Clark County: For almost every observer, the elections office had an ''ambassador'' to escort and observe the observers. Suspicions ran high.\par \par \uc2 ''What are those boxes for?'' an older woman in a red coat inquired, pointing to a couple of empty bins. She was sitting behind a glass barrier encircling a cavernous vote tabulation area that had been transformed into a large fishbowl. A county official assured her that he would check; he later said they were used to store damaged ballots. Then she asked why county workers were allowed to bring in bags, fretting that they could be used to smuggle ballots, and was told they were most likely used by the staff to carry in their lunches.\par \par \uc2 Another observer wanted to know what was written on some blue sticky notes that were too far away to read. (They are used to alphabetize unopened ballots.) And a third, a 61-year-old dental hygienist named Caryl Tunison, asked, ''Why do you not have cameras in every area here?'' while she paused from writing in a notebook on her lap. She was sitting face to face with a young woman about three yards away, a county worker who sat on the other side of a glass partition and was placing envelopes in a bin.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the county elections department said that it ''goes above and beyond what the law requires for observation.''\par \par \uc2 ''We recognize the value of helping observers understand the process and responding to their questions, and work to provide answers to their wide variety of questions every day,'' the statement read.\par \par \uc2 Monitoring elections has long been part of the voting process. But this year, the \uc2 Republican National Committee\uc2  has worked alongside outside groups like the Election Integrity Network to seek out activists who believe conspiracy theories about the 2020 election and elections in general being corrupted. The Election Integrity Network is a group led by Cleta Mitchell, one of Mr. Trump's former lawyers. It is part of an organization in which \uc2 Mark Meadows\uc2 , who served as White House chief of staff during the Trump administration, is a senior partner.\par \par \uc2 A number of Republican candidates around the country have stated that they may not accept election results if they lose, heightening concerns among many elections experts. But election officials say that they, too, are far better organized this time around. That high level of organization -- and the scrutiny from election denial activists -- was evident on a recent visit here.\par \par \uc2 Many of the observers are people like Ms. Tunison, who believes the 2020 election was stolen and who said she was encouraged in her newfound activism by her pastor. She repeated a conspiracy theory, which circulated on social media after the 2020 election, that several swing states simultaneously halted counting to thwart \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2 . ''Who was able to call all the counties and get them to stop counting all at once?'' she asked.\par \par \uc2 ''I just think the whole system is kind of messed up,'' she added in an interview as she was leaving. ''We could do much better. I think the whole system should be scrapped and started over with something that's actually secure.''\par \par \uc2 And what would it be replaced with? ''I'm not exactly sure, but I know that it should be mechanical,'' she said, with ''no internet access to any machine.'' But she also said maybe tabulation could be done with ''something like the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 ,'' referring to the same technology that is at the heart of Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 Baseless theories about foreign plots to hack voting machines have ricocheted around the right-wing media for two years and have been pushed by well-funded Trump allies, including Mike Lindell, the MyPillow chief executive.\par \par \uc2 In fact, there is no evidence of widespread fraud or malfeasance in elections. And while there is a criminal investigation underway of election tampering in Georgia, it is examining the conduct of Mr. Trump and his circle of advisers.\par \par \uc2 Still, a number of Republican lawyers have primed poll monitors to search for irregularities that could be used to bring legal challenges to the results later on.\par \par \uc2 That would repeat a strategy used in some states in 2020, but many involved say they are better organized this election cycle. Even as the monitoring was taking place on Thursday in Clark County, a local judge rejected a bid by the R.N.C. to have more representation on panels that verify ballot signatures.\par \par \uc2 At the Clark County office, ballots come in from polling places and drop boxes and are brought to a loading dock in the back of the warehouse. Then they are moved through a series of stations where observers from the public can view how they are handled.\par \par \uc2 The number of observers fluctuated throughout the day and into the night. There was a woman in a leather hat complaining that she had been treated rudely by a county worker, a man watching while he twiddled a Rubik's Cube.\par \par \uc2 A young man from the R.N.C., who declined to comment, monitored late into the evening, while toting around a book by Ray Dalio, the hedge fund manager, called ''The Changing World Order,'' which ponders the rise of China and the twilight of America.\par \par \uc2 Placards throughout the office inform the observers of state law and guidelines. They are prohibited, the placards say, from ''talking to workers within the central counting'' area or from ''advocating for or against a candidate.''\par \par \uc2 Much of the work is monotonous. In one area, stacks of ballots that had been through a sorting machine were hand counted for verification purposes. Watching the workers count the ballots was a tedious business. One observer, whose hair was pulled back in a pink scrunchie, paused from her own note taking to lean over and whisper to a reporter who was taking his own notes. She offered the friendly admonition of an armchair editor: ''It's going to be a boring article.''\par \par \uc2 In another room, a group of seven observers watched as ballots were fed through the ballot sorting machine. Those that looked good were put into green bins set out on a long table in the middle of the room. Ballots with signatures that could not be verified using county records were sorted into red bins for further review. The sound of the thrumming machine was not unlike a train going over tracks.\par \par \uc2 ''I was being lulled to sleep,'' said Matt Robison, a 60-year-old service technician for a propane company who came with his wife of 39 years, Sandra. They had not come on behalf of any particular group, but because of their own concerns about the last election.\par \par \uc2 ''These people have a job to do, and it looks like they're doing their job,'' said Mr. Robison. ''If there's ballots being shredded or anything like that, there's no way that we'll ever be able to see that. But I personally feel like there had been -- I don't know about necessarily in Nevada -- but there had been election tampering in 2020. But the thing is I think that what we're able to witness here shows people doing their jobs.''\par \par \uc2 Election officials have long hoped that letting skeptics into the process would convince them to reject the conspiracy theories. That seemed a tall order in Clark County.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Robison described himself as uncomfortable with ''woke ideologies'' and as a fan of ''2000 Mules,'' the film promoting conspiracy theories that have been discredited by experts, media outlets and government agencies.\par \par \uc2 ''You know, Dinesh D'Souza's film?'' he said, referring to the film's director, who was pardoned by Mr. Trump after pleading guilty to campaign finance fraud. The film's two star experts, Catherine Engelbrecht and Gregg Phillips, were recently jailed for contempt of court.\par \par \uc2 Still, he was cautious about what he thought about the 2020 election. ''Unless I can see it, unless I actually witness something, then I can't confirm,'' he said, adding that if he ''put my right hand in the air and swear solemnly to tell the truth and the whole truth,'' the ''truth would be I don't know.''\par \par \uc2 His wife, a gun training instructor, is more strident in her views and has come more often to observe. Her husband said, jokingly, that ''she's addicted.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Robison expressed dissatisfaction with the county and the observation process and wanted to see the ballots being unloaded in the back of the building -- ''the entire chain of custody,'' as she put it.\par \par \uc2 The county elections department said in its statement that its ''observation plan was reviewed by the Nevada Secretary of State's Office and upheld by the court before the primary election'' and that ''this included identifying the areas where observation would be provided.''\par \par \uc2 For Trump supporters like Ms. Robison, the 2020 election was a catalyst.\par \par \uc2 ''There's no question in my mind and a lot of other people's minds that 46 should not be in the White House,'' she said, referring to President Biden. ''It was a stolen election.''\par \par \uc2 Above, sealed ballot boxes are stored in cages at the Clark County Election Department in North Las Vegas, Nev. Hundreds of thousands of ballots for the county are processed, sorted and counted there. Left, workers separate ballots in Clark County.

Also covered are some 2019 and 2020 Jetta, Golf, Atlas and \uc2 Audi\uc2  A3 models and some 2020-2021 Atlas Cross Sport and Atlas vehicles.\par \par \uc2 Documents posted Friday by the \uc2 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\uc2  say a sudden pressure loss in all four tires increases the risk of a crash.\par \par \uc2 Dealers will update the tire pressure monitoring software at no charge to owners. Notification letters will be sent Dec. 30.\par \par \uc2 The automaker said it was not aware of any ''incidents or injuries,'' warranty claims or field reports related to the problem. ASSOCIATED PRESS\par \par \uc2 CRYPTOCURRENCY\par \par \uc2 Crypto Exchange Took Trades, Despite Sanctions\par \par \uc2 Crypto giant \uc2 Binance\uc2  has processed Iranian transactions with a value of $8 billion since 2018 despite U.S. sanctions intended to cut Iran off from the global financial system, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  data show.\par \par \uc2 Almost all the funds, some $7.8 billion, flowed between \uc2 Binance\uc2  and Iran's largest crypto exchange, Nobitex, according to a review of data from leading U.S. \uc2 blockchain\uc2  researcher \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 . Nobitex offers guidance on its website on how to skirt sanctions.\par \par \uc2 Three-quarters of the Iranian funds that passed through \uc2 Binance\uc2  were in a relatively low-profile cryptocurrency called Tron that gives users an option to conceal their identities.\par \par \uc2 The new findings come as the Justice Department is pursuing an investigation into possible money laundering by \uc2 Binance\uc2 . The transactions put the company at risk of falling afoul of U.S. prohibitions on doing business with Iran, lawyers and trade-sanctions experts said.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 After decades as outcasts, digital artists are receiving a warm reception from curators at major museums looking to embrace new audiences and retain wealthy donors from the NFT boom.\par \par \uc2 The Museum of Modern Art\uc2 's lobby will glow this winter, not by the twinkling lights of the holiday season but the swirling datascapes of a digital artist whose popularity rose during the speculative frenzy around NFTs.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Refik Anadol plugged more than 138,000 images and text materials from the museum's publicly available archive into a machine-learning model to create hundreds of colorful abstractions that he called ''machine hallucinations,'' selling them as NFTs, or nonfungible tokens.\par \par \uc2 It was the beginning of a quiet partnership between Anadol, a 37-year-old Turkish American artist, and the MoMA curators Michelle Kuo and \uc2 Paola Antonelli\uc2  -- and it was a financial boon for both parties. Some of the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based artworks wound up selling for thousands of dollars, with the most exclusive one selling for $200,000. Within the fine print of the transactions was a note that the museum would earn nearly 17 percent of all primary sales and 5 percent of all secondary sales. For \uc2 MoMA\uc2 , struggling with pandemic attendance drop-off -- from about three million in normal times to 1.65 million last fiscal year -- growing a digital audience makes good financial sense.\par \par \uc2 Now, the curators have invited Anadol to dig deeper into the \uc2 MoMA\uc2  archives for the new data-driven installation, ''Refik Anadol: Unsupervised,'' which will start Nov. 19 in the Gund Lobby and run through March 5.\par \par \uc2 ''Being open to new technology is part of our responsibility,'' said Antonelli, the museum's senior curator for the department of architecture and design, who is known for guiding \uc2 MoMA\uc2 's acquisitions of historical video games like Pac-Man and the @ symbol. ''We are never jumping on new technologies, but rather realizing that we need to keep pace with the world.''\par \par \uc2 Until recently, most museums had spurned digital art collections in favor of the paintings and sculptures that still dominate their galleries. But after budgets tightened and attendance plateaued during the coronavirus pandemic, the industry has started to embrace artistic experiments involving \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , virtual reality and artificial intelligence programs. Curators want to connect with younger, tech-obsessed audiences and catch the interest of any crypto millionaires who might donate.\par \par \uc2 At the \uc2 Guggenheim Museum\uc2 , executives are hiring a new assistant curator for digital art that will be funded by LG, the electronics company, which is also paying for a $100,000 annual award to artists making ''groundbreaking achievements in technology-based art.'' Conservators are also exploring the possibility of uploading ownership records to the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , which could help art historians researching the collection.\par \par \uc2 Naomi Beckwith, the museum's deputy director and chief curator, said that while some trustees had been focused on the financial possibilities of NFTs, her curatorial team had a broader mandate to follow artists into the metaverse, buzzy shorthand for new online technologies.\par \par \uc2 ''We have hit a critical point where the technology that's available to artists has far outpaced what museums can offer in terms of resources. So we have to beef up,'' Beckwith said. ''If artists are working with technology, then we have to be able to hold it.''\par \par \uc2 Historically, museums have been reluctant to embrace technologies that might require conservation tools and curatorial expertise beyond the classical traditions of painting and sculpture. It took nearly a century after photography was invented for the artistic medium to receive its first museum exhibition in the United States. That 1910 show at Buffalo's Albright Art Gallery was arranged to demonstrate that photography could be a visual form of artistic expression during an era when most people regarded cameras as documentary tools.\par \par \uc2 Things move much faster nowadays. Only 14 years after the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  was invented through the development of cryptocurrency, that same gallery, now called the Buffalo AKG Art Museum, will have an online auction that the curator Tina Rivers Ryan billed as the first survey of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  art by a major American museum. ''Peer to Peer'' will open in November with commissioned works by more than a dozen digital artists, including Rhea Myers, LaTurbo Avedon and Itzel Yard (known online as IX Shells).\par \par \uc2 A museum spokesman, Woody Brown, was careful to avoid saying that his institution was selling NFTs, preferring to describe the offerings as ''digital artworks by artists who are engaged with \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technologies.'' However, many of the artists included in the exhibition are known for selling NFTs and the show is being produced alongside Feral File, an NFT marketplace that also hosted the sale for Anadol's collaboration with \uc2 MoMA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The sharp decline of the NFT market, with trading volume plummeting nearly 97 percent compared with record highs, is already starting to change the way digital art is branded. Some artists and curators are avoiding the term because of its association with speculation and scamming. Others complain that marketers used the abbreviation as a catchall over the past two years, incorrectly lumping together different types of digital art to take advantage of the bull market.\par \par \uc2 Christiane Paul, the Whitney Museum's digital art curator, described the situation as a mixed blessing for her field of expertise. ''On the upside, NFTs have generated more interest and awareness for digital art,'' she said. ''But one of my pet peeves is how people now equate digital art with JPEGs and spinning little GIFs when it's a medium that has a 60-year-long history that consists of everything from algorithmic drawings to internet art.''\par \par \uc2 Paul was recently promoted after nearly 20 years as an adjunct with the Whitney. What changed? NFTs.\par \par \uc2 ''Usually I had to sell the idea of digital art to the upper administrative levels,'' she said. ''Now trustees are coming to me and asking if the Whitney should be in the metaverse.''\par \par \uc2 Paul has used her expanded position to advocate more digital art in the museum, which commissions works annually through its Artport program. She said her job now was to fill gaps in the museum's collection, starting with the early days of computer drawings in the 1960s by artists like Manfred Mohr and the software experiments of the 1980s.\par \par \uc2 She said the museum has already collected several NFTs, including work from Eve Sussman's series ''89 Seconds Atomized,'' which fractionalizes the artist's video ''89 Seconds at Alcaz\u225\'00\'E1r'' into 2,304 unique works that can be reassembled by collectors.\par \par \uc2 The curator said her approach was cautious. ''We see NFTs as a natural extension of artistic practices in the digital field,,'' Paul explained.\par \par \uc2 Some museums have been a little more adventurous, however, and the many initiatives \uc2 MoMA\uc2  had planned over the past year are starting to bear fruit.\par \par \uc2 With its share of profits from Anadol's ''machine hallucinations,'' the museum hired a young associate named Madeleine Pierpont to help develop projects in the digital world. On a recent job posting, these included building membership and retail programs involving NFTs; facilitating artist \uc2 blockchain\uc2  projects; and researching partnerships with the crypto community.\par \par \uc2 In September, a foundation for the media mogul William Paley, who founded CBS, announced that it would auction a trove of artworks from his collection (including pieces by Picasso, Rodin and Renoir) for an estimated $70 million. The proceeds are supposed to help \uc2 MoMA\uc2  further expand its digital footprint, and the museum's director, \uc2 Glenn Lowry\uc2 , did not rule out the possibility of purchasing NFTs with the money when asked by The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 ''We're conscious of the fact that we lend an imprimatur when we acquire pieces,'' he told The Journal, ''but that doesn't mean we should avoid the domain.''\par \par \uc2 Over the past year, \uc2 MoMA\uc2  curators and trustees have quietly met with several blue-chip NFT artists like Mike Winkelmann (known as Beeple), Justin Aversano and Dmitri Cherniak. And during a recent event at the museum about how artists are using new web technologies, curators provided attendees with a free NFT they had commissioned by the artist Stephanie Dinkins.\par \par \uc2 Collectors have also made overtures. Ryan Zurrer, a venture capitalist in the crypto industry who owns one of Anadol's NFTs, said he was interested in donating his edition to the museum.\par \par \uc2 Kuo, the \uc2 MoMA\uc2  curator, declined to discuss whether the museum would take Zurrer up on his offer. For now, she remains focused on installing Anadol's living vortex of algorithmically generated visions in the museum's lobby. The artist's machine-learning program will continuously develop new images, combining information from the museum's collections with real-time data from the environment inside and outside the building, including motion and climate.\par \par \uc2 ''Refik is bending data -- which we normally associate with rational systems -- into a realm of surrealism and irrationality,'' Kuo said. ''His interpretation of \uc2 MoMA\uc2 's data set is essentially a transformation of the history of modern art.''\par \par \uc2 Samples of data visualizations for ''Refik Anadol: Unsupervised,'' an exhibition that opens at the Museum of Modern Art on Nov. 19.

\par\par \uc2 LIVING IN\par \uc2 Real Estate Desk; SECTRE\par \b \uc2 In Transition and an Interesting Place to Live\b0\par\par\uc2 By Aileen Jacobson \par \uc2 1,861 \uc2 words\par \uc2 30 October 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 9\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Some residents resent efforts to brand the area as a separate space within Harlem, but it's clearly a neighborhood in transition: ''Everywhere you look, there's construction.''\par \par \uc2 From her South Harlem condo, Michelle Thompson has an easy walk to her favorite waterfall in Central Park -- easy enough that she can visit several times a week.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Thompson, 54, advises her clients to do the same -- get outside and take the ''stress out of your body'' -- in her role as the owner of Resistant Vision Coaching and Consulting, her third career after stints as a lawyer and a teacher of colonial Caribbean history, which is part of her heritage. She has been in her home for more than five years now, since buying the two-bedroom, two-bath apartment on Fifth Avenue, a few blocks north of Central Park, for less than $1 million.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Thompson is one of many buyers who have embraced the neighborhood in recent years. Although some residents resent efforts by the real estate industry to rebrand it as South Harlem, a separate area within Harlem, she said she has ''no strong feelings'' about that, or about the changes to the neighborhood, which is rapidly becoming more upscale.\par \par \uc2 ''Everywhere you look, there's construction,'' said Amanda P. Jhones, a longtime resident who is a broker with Coldwell Banker Warburg, and also a jazz musician. The changes started 15 or 20 years ago, she said, ''and I have to say, they are changes for the better. In the beginning, as you know, people were afraid to go here. Now there is a police presence, and cleaner streets.''\par \par \uc2 Despite continuing struggles with drugs and homelessness, she said, ''the transformation is stunning.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's very much a neighborhood in transition, but I see that as a positive,'' said Lane Rettig, 39, a manager at a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  start-up company, who was born and raised in East Harlem, where his father, a professor of psychology at Hunter College, found affordable housing. ''I'm white, and my wife is Chinese.''\par \par \uc2 He and his wife, Lily Rettig, 35, a designer who works for \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , bought their first home last year after deciding to start a family: a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment on the 10th floor of a building on Central Park North, paying $3.5 million. They have two patios, one facing Harlem and the other overlooking Central Park.\par \par \uc2 ''We can see Billionaires' Row on 57th Street, past the foliage,'' Mr. Rettig said. While he works from home, Ms. Rettig commutes to downtown Newark several days a week, taking a \uc2 New Jersey Transit\uc2  train from Penn Station. He enjoys morning jogs along a six-mile loop in Central Park, and the couple, who have a 4-month-old son, like to visit the farmers' market in Morningside Park on Saturday mornings.\par \par \uc2 Akia Mitchell, a senior director at a British advertising company, and her husband, Reginald Greene, a lawyer, recently started a family in South Harlem, as well. The couple traded up from a large studio in a brownstone to a two-bedroom, two-bath apartment that they share with their 8-month-old son, paying $3,200 a month. ''Once I got pregnant, we wanted to live near Central Park but still be in Harlem, in a diverse building,'' said Ms. Mitchell, 37, who is Black. ''I grew up in Harlem, and I want my son to have some connection to Black people.''\par \par \uc2 Although the demographics in the area are changing -- between 2010 and 2020, South Harlem gained 4,458 non-Hispanic white residents and lost 4,492 non-Hispanic Black ones, according to census figures -- ''there's still a large Black population here,'' Ms. Mitchell said. (According to the \uc2 United States Census Bureau\uc2 , the Black non-Hispanic population of South Harlem decreased to 43.1 percent in 2020, from 55.9 percent in 2010; the white non-Hispanic population increased to 23.6 percent from 16.1 percent; the Asian non-Hispanic population increased to 5.7 percent from 3.5 percent; and the Hispanic population stayed virtually the same, decreasing slightly from 21.1 percent to 21 percent.)\par \par \uc2 There are also lots of good restaurants, and in the summer, the streets are filled with music and activity. ''Harlem is loud,'' she said. ''You've got to be OK with that.''\par \par \uc2 What You'll Find\par \par \uc2 South Harlem has been defined in various ways, with varying boundaries, but a common definition is from 110th Street/Central Park North up to 125th Street, and from the western edge of Morningside Park to Park Avenue.\par \par \uc2 Central Park plays a large part in many residents' lives, as do Morningside Park and Marcus Garvey Park. The handsome brownstones surrounding Marcus Garvey Park and on many other streets contribute to the neighborhood's historic charm, as do the numerous churches, some acting as community centers and others drawing tourists in search of a gospel service.\par \par \uc2 The ''main street of Harlem,'' as it is sometimes called, is 125th Street, a commercial and artistic hub. Among its attractions: the legendary Apollo Theater, which has raised $63 million of a $70 million campaign for the first full-scale renovation and upgrade of the 108-year-old landmark building; the Studio Museum in Harlem, currently closed for rebuilding; and the popular \uc2 Whole Foods Market\uc2 , in a building filled with national chain stores.\par \par \uc2 Vendors in outdoor booths also line the street, and a Target and a Trader Joe's are in the works, said Whitney Osentoski, a broker at Brown Harris Stevens specializing in new development. ''Because of building codes, there are no tall buildings, and wide sidewalks,'' Mr. Osentoski said. ''People have space.''\par \par \uc2 They can also find good views, especially in newer buildings. Yiannes Einhorn, the principal of Grid Group, said his company spent two and a half years designing the 13-story building at 145 Central Park North so that every apartment has front and back views.\par \par \uc2 ''We were excited to see a lot of projects happening,'' Mr. Einhorn said of the area. ''We saw a lot of restaurants opening, and a lot of vibrancy and stores and services. We saw it as a busy, interesting place to live.''\par \par \uc2 The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Towers, a public housing complex that stretches from Lenox Avenue to Fifth Avenue and from West 112th Street to West 115th Street, includes 10 red-brick buildings, each shaped like an elongated X.\par \par \uc2 What You'll Pay\par \par \uc2 The median sale price of homes in the neighborhood has increased over the past three years, said John Walkup, a founder of UrbanDigs, the real estate data analytics firm. In May 2019, it was $1.078 million; by May 2022, it had climbed to $1.139 million.\par \par \uc2 But prices vary enormously. In a late October search of StreetEasy, the least expensive listings were mostly in Housing Development Fund Corporation (H.D.F.C.) buildings, which impose income restrictions on buyers. The lowest priced listing was a one-bedroom, one-bath co-op at 144 West 119th Street, for $365,000; the highest priced were two multiunit townhouses (one at 13 West 122nd Street, with seven bedrooms and three bathrooms, and the other at 274 Lenox Avenue, with three bedrooms and three-plus bathrooms), for $3.995 million each.\par \par \uc2 As for rentals, the least expensive was a one-bedroom, one-bath, fourth-floor walk-up apartment at 50 East 119th Street, for $1,899 a month; the priciest was a townhouse at 360 West 123rd Street with six bedrooms, six full bathrooms, seven half bathrooms, two kitchens and an elevator, for $20,000 a month.\par \par \uc2 The Vibe\par \par \uc2 Marcus Garvey Park has an outdoor swimming pool, a playing field, two playgrounds, a recreation center and a dog run, in addition to the 1,600-seat Richard Rodgers Amphitheater, completed in 2011. The outdoor theater hosts music, dance and theater events, especially during the summer. Other offerings, including aerobics classes and Zen meditation, continue beyond the summer.\par \par \uc2 On a smaller scale, StreetSquash, at 41 West 115th Street, offers not only squash lessons but also academic help, college access services and social-work aid to local students.\par \par \uc2 The busy Malcolm Shabazz Harlem Market is a vibrant indoor-outdoor collection of stalls at 52 West 116th Street, just east of Malcolm X Boulevard. Wares sold by vendors include clothing, jewelry, African masks, crafts and artwork.\par \par \uc2 Although slightly past the neighborhood's northern boundary, the popular Red Rooster Harlem offers a gospel Sunday brunch, and the famous soul food restaurant Sylvia's is a few steps beyond.\par \par \uc2 The Schools\par \par \uc2 At least six public elementary schools are in South Harlem or zoned for various parts of it.\par \par \uc2 Public School 149 Sojourner Truth, at 41 West 117th Street, has about 200 students in prekindergarten through eighth grade. In the 2018-19 School Quality Snapshot (the latest to include testing results, because of Covid-19), 22 percent of students met state standards in English versus 47 percent citywide; in math, 18 percent met state standards versus 46 percent citywide.\par \par \uc2 Public School 154 Harriet Tubman, on West 127th Street, enrolls about 219 students in prekindergarten through fifth grade; 30 percent of its students met standards in English versus 48 percent citywide; 25 percent met standards in math versus 50 percent citywide.\par \par \uc2 There are also a number of charter schools in the neighborhood, including Harlem Prep Elementary School and Harlem Village Academies.\par \par \uc2 The Commute\par \par \uc2 The 2 and 3 subway lines run under Malcolm X Boulevard and stop at Central Park Boulevard, West 116th Street and West 125th Street. The A, B, C and D trains, which run under Frederick Douglass Boulevard, also make several stops, and there are numerous buses.\par \par \uc2 The 4, 5 and 6 trains stop along Lexington Avenue, a block east of the neighborhood.\par \par \uc2 The History\par \par \uc2 Marcus Garvey Park was opened on Dec. 1, 1840, as Mount Morris Park by Robert H. Morris, the 64th mayor of New York City, according to the Marcus Garvey Park Alliance. In 1967, the original amphitheater and recreation center were completed, and in 1968, the Harlem Cultural Festival was organized. The festival evolved into a series of six Sunday afternoon concerts in 1969 that became known as the Black Woodstock. Performers included Stevie Wonder, Mahalia Jackson, Nina Simone, the 5th Dimension, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Sly and the Family Stone, the Staple Singers and B.B. King. Footage from the concerts and interviews with some of the participants were featured in the Oscar-winning 2021 documentary ''Summer of Soul,'' directed by Questlove. In the 1970s, advocacy groups suggested renaming the park for Marcus Garvey, the publisher, journalist, entrepreneur and founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League. The City Council voted to rename the park in 1973.\par \par \uc2 For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.\par \par \uc2 South Harlem, an area north of Central Park that has been rebranded by the real estate industry, is a vibrant community undergoing rapid development and gentrification.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 It's All and All Musk's Changing\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erin Griffith \par \uc2 1,151 \uc2 words\par \uc2 29 October 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The way forward for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is uncertain. But that means Mr. Musk can innovate and change the platform for the better, his supporters say.\par \par \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  closes his purchase of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and fires several top executives. Follow for the latest news updates .\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are cheering for a decentralized social network. Supporters of Donald J. Trump hope that the former president will return to tweeting. Some free speech advocates envision an end to censorship. And loyal fans of \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  are betting that the billionaire will innovate.\par \par \uc2 For these groups and others, \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's $44 billion sale to Mr. Musk, which closed on Thursday, is a moment to celebrate. The six-month path to buying (then attempting to back out of buying, then being sued into buying) the social network was a roller-coaster ride, a tragicomedy and, for many people involved in it, a waking nightmare.\par \par \uc2 But throughout the drama, the deal elicited a frisson of excitement from a wide swath of people for a range of reasons. By captivating celebrities, commentators and world leaders, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has lodged itself into the fabric of society. The platform's future under Mr. Musk has become a symbolic receptacle of people's desires to push the world in the direction they want it to go.\par \par \uc2 Few tech executives elicit the kind of blind adoration that Mr. Musk does. His fans -- known variously as Muskies, Muskites, Muskrats and Musketeers -- defend even his most questionable moves. His deal to buy \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has had plenty of critics, including the company's employees, some lawmakers and disinformation researchers. Many fear what he will do with the platform, over which he now has more or less absolute power as its owner. But on Musk-focused message boards, Discord servers, blogs, podcasts and \uc2 YouTube\uc2  channels, the deal is a triumph.\par \par \uc2 ''Him buying \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is pretty awesome,'' said Bryce Paul, the host of the podcast ''Crypto 101.'' Mr. Paul does not consider himself a Musk fanboy but believes the billionaire is a ''genius'' and a ''modern-day da Vinci.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk has discussed plans to transform \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , which has not found the business success of its social media competitors. The company's stock price has lagged, its user growth has stalled and its profits have been spotty. Since announcing his takeover plans in April, Mr. Musk has floated laying off \uc2 Twitter\uc2  employees, loosening the site's moderation policies, incorporating \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology, charging subscription fees and making it into an ''everything app'' called X.\par \par \uc2 First Amendment scholars have cheered Mr. Musk's plans for less moderation on the platform, citing instances when \uc2 Twitter\uc2  banned users who had tweeted about pandemic policies or removed content, like a New York Post article about \uc2 Hunter Biden\uc2 's laptop, as censorship run amok.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Twitter\uc2  is a tragic example of how censorship can become an insatiable appetite,'' said Jonathan Turley, a professor at the \uc2 George Washington University Law School\uc2 . ''Once you start to regulate speech, it's difficult to stop a natural expansion of that system. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is a vivid example of that.''\par \par \uc2 Conservatives, some of whom claim \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has ''shadow-banned'' them (that is, hidden their tweets from followers without telling them), have also cheered Mr. Musk's takeover. Mr. Musk said in May that he would lift \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's ban on Mr. Trump.\par \par \uc2 Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative commentator, predicted that his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  following would double under Mr. Musk's ownership and egged on the potential layoffs. ''I think @elonmusk would do well to fire EVERYBODY and then carefully rehire the ones who share his vision of a free speech internet,'' Mr. D'Souza wrote this month.\par \par \uc2 Others are in favor of more transparency. Jano le Roux, the director of marketing at Likeflare, a marketing agency in the San Francisco Bay Area, said he was surprised that more people weren't in favor of the deal. He supported the possibility that Mr. Musk could expose more information about \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's algorithms, which determine which tweets find big audiences.\par \par \uc2 ''It's really important we put glass walls on what is, essentially, the messaging factory of the world,'' he said. Making the formulas of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's algorithms public could benefit democracy, he added.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency fans have also rhapsodized about the future of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  under Mr. Musk, who has participated in crypto culture by sharing memes on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and cracking jokes about the virtual currency Dogecoin on ''Saturday Night Live.'' After Mr. Musk agreed to buy \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , he discussed various cryptocurrency integrations, including running the social media service on a decentralized \uc2 blockchain\uc2  network, according to text messages released as part of the legal fight over the deal.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk ultimately concluded that ''\uc2 blockchain\uc2 Twitter\uc2 '' wasn't possible and complained about having to endure ''laborious \uc2 blockchain\uc2  debate,'' according to his messages. But rumors about a different crypto solution under Mr. Musk -- digital currency wallets for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  users -- bubbled up this week.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul, the podcaster, said such a move could drive adoption of digital currencies.\par \par \uc2 ''You have the world's richest man, in some way, legitimizing some of our concepts and ideas, and it will be a fantastic onboarding platform,'' he said. The crypto world, he added, is generally pro-Musk.\par \par \uc2 ''I've heard very few dissenting opinions about Elon,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 In the days before the deal closed, some business leaders also made vaguely encouraging public comments about Mr. Musk, much as they might congratulate a new president.\par \par \uc2 Cathie Wood, the cryptocurrency investor, said in an interview with Yahoo Finance that she was ''excited'' to see Mr. Musk ''open up the ecosystem, take away the censorship, make it much more transparent and, I think, add more value.''\par \par \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2 , the chief executive of \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2 , told CNBC that he hoped Mr. Musk ''cleans up \uc2 Twitter\uc2 '' by eliminating ''all those people in the public square who are robots and emails and stuff like that.''\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Musk tweeted a video of himself carrying a sink into \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's headquarters in San Francisco on Wednesday -- adding ''Let that sink in,'' a recurring joke on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , to the post -- his fans responded with memes: Mr. Musk as Mr. Trump firing contestants on ''The Apprentice''; Mr. Musk as Thanos; Mr. Musk as Ari Gold (of ''Entourage''); and Mr. Musk as Drake.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  employees were less enthusiastic. Stephanie Guevara, an engineer at the company, tweeted at Mr. Musk after his visit to the office.\par \par \uc2 ''Was it fun to look at the faces of the people you said you'd be laying off?'' she wrote. The post was quickly seized upon by Musk's fans, who called for her to be fired.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have been heartened by Elon Musk's discussion of integration and of digital wallets.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Binance\uc2  Is Hit by a $570 Million Hack\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 452 \uc2 words\par \uc2 8 October 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange confirmed that assets were stolen from the Binance Smart Chain network, the latest in a series of attacks on so-called cross-chain bridges.\par \par \uc2 Binance\uc2 , the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed on Friday that $570 million had been stolen in a hack of a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  it runs that serves as a bridge for asset transfers between networks. The attack on the Binance Smart Chain network highlighted weaknesses in decentralized finance, or DeFi, where transactions are controlled by code.\par \par \uc2 ''Software code is never bug free,'' \uc2 Binance\uc2 's chief executive, \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2 , said in an interview with CNBC. He emphasized that no users had lost money in the hack but said that so-called cross-chain bridges were particularly vulnerable to hacks and the industry needed to get better at learning from them.\par \par \uc2 ''We have seen a series of attacks on targeting vulnerabilities in cross-chain bridges,'' Binance Smart Chain wrote in a blog post apologizing to users. ''We will openly share the details of the postmortem and all lessons on how to implement more advanced security measures to shore-up these vulnerabilities.''\par \par \uc2 In August, the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  research company \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2  estimated that $2 billion worth of cryptocurrency had been stolen in 13 cross-chain bridge attacks, mostly in 2022. In March, an attack drained $600 million from a bridge behind the crypto-powered video game Axie Infinity. In February, $325 million was stolen from the Wormhole network.\par \par \uc2 These exploits show that a reliance on code for control of DeFi platforms leaves these systems exposed, and that in emergency situations, decentralization can be an obstacle to quickly resolving issues. The \uc2 Binance\uc2  chain ecosystem is run by a community of users, known as validators, who hold tokens and can vote on proposed code changes.\par \par \uc2 ''Decentralized chains are not designed to be stopped, but by contacting community validators one by one, we were able to stop the incident from spreading,'' Binance Smart Chain said in its statement. ''This delayed closure, but we were able to minimize the loss.''\par \par \uc2 Now, the Binance Smart Chain community will hold a vote on next steps, including whether to freeze the stolen funds and allot a bounty for catching the hackers, offering up to 10 percent of the value of the stolen assets.\par \par \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2 , one of the founders of the Ethereum network -- and the second-most-popular cryptocurrency, Ether -- has been a vocal critic of cross-chain bridges, noting that they have ''fundamental security limits.''\par \par \uc2 ''Software code is never bug free,'' Changpeng Zhao, Binance's chief executive, said on Friday.

\par\par \uc2 THE SHIFT\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 What \uc2 Twitter\uc2  May Become With Musk At the Helm\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kevin Roose \par \uc2 1,963 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 October 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 His deal to buy the company is back on. Here are six predictions about \uc2 Twitter\uc2  under Musk's control, if it happens.\par \par \uc2 Buckle up.\par \par \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , who for months has been strenuously trying to back out of a deal to buy \uc2 Twitter\uc2  for $44 billion, now appears ready to buy the company after all. In a surprise letter to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on Monday night, Mr. Musk offered to take \uc2 Twitter\uc2  private at his originally proposed price -- $54.20 per share -- marking a possible end to one of the most dramatic legal feuds in Silicon Valley history.\par \par \uc2 It's worth noting that the deal could still fall apart -- Mr. Musk is famously subject to 11th-hour mood shifts -- but the most likely outcome now is that the world's richest man will in fact become \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's new owner, possibly as soon as this week.\par \par \uc2 Much is unknown about what Mr. Musk will do with \uc2 Twitter\uc2  if he acquires it. The mercurial billionaire has made only the vaguest of public statements about his plans for the company and its products.\par \par \uc2 But we now know, thanks in part to a bevy of text messages released as part of the protracted legal battle, that it will be nothing like business as usual. And there are at least six predictions I feel confident making, if the deal does in fact close.\par \par \uc2 He's going to clean house, starting with firing \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's chief executive, \uc2 Parag Agrawal\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A juicy set of text messages between Mr. Musk and his friends and business associates emerged last week, as part of the legal battle. In them, Mr. Musk made clear that he was unhappy with \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's current leadership -- in particular with \uc2 Parag Agrawal\uc2 , the chief executive, who took over last year from \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The texts revealed that Mr. Agrawal had initially sought to work constructively with Mr. Musk, and that the two even had a friendly dinner near San Jose, Calif., in March. But the men eventually clashed. Mr. Agrawal, at one point, told Mr. Musk via text message that his habit of tweeting things like ''Is \uc2 Twitter\uc2  dying?'' was ''not helping me make \uc2 Twitter\uc2  better.''\par \par \uc2 ''What did you get done this week?'' Mr. Musk shot back. ''This is a waste of time.''\par \par \uc2 From reading Mr. Musk's texts, it's clear he believes that \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's leadership is weak and ineffective, and lacks the ability to carry out his vision for the company. If Mr. Agrawal doesn't immediately resign once the deal is complete, I'd expect Mr. Musk to fire him on Day 1 and name himself or a close ally as a replacement.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk has also expressed displeasure with other \uc2 Twitter\uc2  executives, and it's hard to see how he could fire Mr. Agrawal without also clearing out most or all of the company's top leadership and installing his own slate of loyalists.\par \par \uc2 Employees will revolt.\par \par \uc2 Another easy prediction to make about Mr. Musk's takeover is that it will generate enormous backlash among \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's rank-and-file employees.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , more so than other social media platforms, has a vocally progressive work force and many employees who are deeply invested in the company's mission of promoting ''healthy conversation.'' Those employees may believe -- for good reason! -- that under Mr. Musk's leadership, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  will abandon many of the projects they care about in areas like trust and safety. Or they may simply not want to deal with the drama and tumult of a Musk regime, and start looking for jobs elsewhere.\par \par \uc2 Some employees have already quit, anticipating a Musk takeover. And it's safe to bet that many more will follow if the deal actually closes.\par \par \uc2 It's worth noting that in his texts with Mr. Musk, Mr. Agrawal claimed that a ''large silent majority'' of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  employees supported Mr. Musk's vision. But virtually every \uc2 Twitter\uc2  employee I've spoken to in the last six months has told me that he or she plans to leave if Mr. Musk takes over.\par \par \uc2 It's also worth noting that Mr. Musk may not mind if thousands of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  employees show themselves the door. He has implied that the company's staff is bloated, and now that he needs to justify a $44 billion price tag, an exodus of unhappy employees might be the kind of savings he's looking for.\par \par \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  will return to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , along with a swarm of other right-wing culture warriors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk, who has framed his bid for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  as an attempt to preserve free speech on the platform, has long said that, if successful, he would allow former President \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  to reclaim his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account, which was permanently suspended last year after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.\par \par \uc2 That will happen almost immediately, I predict. (And, yes, Mr. Trump will come back to \uc2 Twitter\uc2  if he's invited, no matter how much fun he's having on Truth Social.)\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Musk's ''replatforming'' will extend far beyond the former president. A host of right-wing culture warriors could come back to the service with Mr. Musk's blessing, including those who were barred for expressing hateful views, spreading false conspiracy theories and harassing other users. (In his text messages, Mr. Musk told Mr. Agrawal that he wanted to reverse all permanent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  bans ''except for spam accounts and those that explicitly advocate violence.'')\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk, who styles himself a centrist but often crusades against the ''woke left,'' has made no secret of his plans to make \uc2 Twitter\uc2  a friendlier platform for right-wing voices. He has expressed support for The Babylon Bee, a conservative satire site whose \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account was suspended after it published a transphobic humor piece about a Biden administration official. And Representative \uc2 Marjorie Taylor Greene\uc2 , whose personal \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account was suspended this year for repeatedly sharing misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines, has urged Mr. Musk to reinstate her along with other right-wing commentators, including Alex Jones, the founder of Infowars.\par \par \uc2 Along with one-off reversals of high-profile bans, I'd also expect that Mr. Musk would tear up \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's existing rules and rewrite new ones, and that he might dismantle \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's content-policy and trust-and-safety teams, which are responsible for enforcing the platform's rules as they currently exist. (That is, if those teams don't quit en masse first.)\par \par \uc2 He might even name his own set of free-speech absolutists. One friend of Mr. Musk's suggested that he install someone like \uc2 Blake Masters\uc2 , the Republican Senate candidate from Arizona, as \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's head of enforcement, according to the trove of text messages released during the court battle. (Mr. Musk did not respond to the suggestion.)\par \par \uc2 It probably won't change the midterms, but 2024 could be the Elon Election.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk's takeover could happen before next month's midterm elections. And if it does, there could still be time for him to make decisions, like allowing Mr. Trump back on the platform or loosening restrictions on political ads, that could reshape the conversation about some races.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Musk -- who, let's not forget, runs several other companies -- will have his hands full between now and November. And I don't think that, with only a month left until the elections, there will be a straight line from Mr. Musk's takeover to, say, a Republican sweep of close House and Senate races.\par \par \uc2 The 2024 election, though, will be a different story. By then, if the deal is consummated, Mr. Musk will have been able to more fully mold \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in his own image. The platform could look radically different by then -- more right-wing trolls, fewer guardrails against misinformation and extremism -- or it could be largely the same. But Mr. Musk will be firmly in charge, and if \uc2 Twitter\uc2  still plays anywhere near the role in American political and media culture that it does today, he will emerge as a central, polarizing figure in the 2024 election cycle.\par \par \uc2 Republicans are, for obvious reasons, excited about Mr. Musk's taking over. But the ultimate political consequences of his ownership are harder to predict. It's theoretically possible -- though, I concede, probably unlikely -- that Mr. Musk's owning \uc2 Twitter\uc2  could be good for Democrats in 2022 and 2024, if it allows more Republican politicians to stake out extreme positions on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that end up backfiring on them at the ballot box.\par \par \uc2 But whatever moves Mr. Musk makes before 2024, it's a good bet that they will be closely scrutinized for signs that he is putting his thumb on the scale.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  will kill unpopular features, go after bots and introduce new subscription products.\par \par \uc2 Some of the most revealing exchanges in Mr. Musk's trove of text messages were about his thoughts on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's products.\par \par \uc2 In particular, Mr. Musk was dismissive of Twitter Blue, the company's subscription-based product that gives users access to premium features like ad-free articles and an undo button for tweets. Perhaps surprisingly, given his love of cryptocurrency, Mr. Musk also appeared skeptical of proposals to rebuild \uc2 Twitter\uc2  on a decentralized \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , saying that ''\uc2 blockchain\uc2 Twitter\uc2  won't work.''\par \par \uc2 Based on his statements, and pitches he made to investors this summer while trying to pull a deal together, I'd expect Mr. Musk to make several changes to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's products early on. First, he will move to shut down many of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's noncore features -- including some of those in Twitter Blue, but also any other features that don't generate much revenue for the company. He will try to rid the site of spam bots, a problem that he has long singled out as one of the worst parts of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . (And which formed the basis of his spurious attempt to get out of the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  deal, back before he decided to buy it again.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk will also try to shift \uc2 Twitter\uc2  away from advertising revenue and toward other moneymaking opportunities -- including payments features, data-licensing agreements and a mysterious new subscription product, which he has called only X, and which he has claimed will have 104 million paying users by 2028.\par \par \uc2 Musk will remain the center of attention.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the easiest prediction to make about Mr. Musk's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  takeover is that it will make him an even bigger celebrity.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk is, of course, already one of the most well known people in the world. But until now, his power has largely been a function of his extreme wealth and the size of his online following. He could get in flame wars, make crude jokes about senators or threaten to move his companies out of California, and all of this mattered a great deal to the people involved -- but it was all ultimately soft power that was contingent on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's willingness to let him keep throwing bombs at his 108 million followers, and the public's willingness to keep paying attention.\par \par \uc2 Owning \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is different. If the deal closes, Mr. Musk will have direct control over one of the world's largest megaphones, and will be able to use it entirely as he sees fit -- whether that's to turn it into a lawless free-for-all, take revenge on his political enemies, promote his own business ventures or do something else entirely. And given Mr. Musk's penchant for seizing the spotlight, we can expect that whatever he chooses to do with \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , it won't be boring.\par \par \uc2 There was already no escaping Mr. Musk. Now, looking away will be truly impossible.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY JONATHAN NEWTON/THE WASHINGTON POST VIA GETTY IMAGES) (B5) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020221005eia50005e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Regulators Are Warning of Crypto's Potential Risks\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 939 \uc2 words\par \uc2 4 October 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 4\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Financial Stability Oversight Council said that the growing crypto market could pose risks to the broader financial system.\par \par \uc2 A federal panel responsible for monitoring financial system risks sounded a warning on Monday about cryptocurrency markets, saying that the widespread adoption of digital assets poses risks if the market continues to grow without better oversight and enforcement.\par \par \uc2 It is the first major report on cryptocurrencies by the \uc2 Financial Stability Oversight Council\uc2 , which is led by the Treasury Department and was created after the 2008 financial crisis to help identify and mitigate threats to the financial system.\par \par \uc2 ''The scale of crypto-asset activities has increased significantly in recent years. Although interconnections with the traditional financial system are currently relatively limited, they could potentially increase rapidly,'' the report said.\par \par \uc2 Concerns about vulnerabilities in the crypto markets have become more pronounced in recent months, in the wake of wild swings in price and serious losses in the industry. In May, the collapse of a single asset led to a downward spiral in prices throughout crypto markets, prompting a rash of bankruptcies, consolidation and layoffs in the industry, and leaving many investors stranded, unable to access their assets.\par \par \uc2 When the cryptocurrency market exploded and reached about $3 trillion in value around this time last year, officials feared that rampant speculation and insufficient oversight of digital asset activity could infect the wider system and called for an assessment. Although about $2 trillion in value has been wiped out since then, the risks are no less pressing now.\par \par \uc2 A Treasury spokesman said that recent volatility has highlighted the need for more action.\par \par \uc2 The panel, which includes the leaders of all U.S. banking and financial agencies, repeatedly emphasized that existing laws already cover many of the activities in crypto markets. The report urged all agencies, including the Securities Exchange Commission and the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , to prioritize crypto enforcement and recommended that Congress provide regulatory agencies with more resources to police crypto.\par \par \uc2 The report also outlined gaps where regulators say more legislation is needed, particularly for issuers of a type of digital asset known as a stablecoin.\par \par \uc2 Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies ostensibly pegged to the value of a stable asset like the dollar that have sometimes proven wobblier than promised. Regulators have identified stablecoins as posing one of the most immediate risks to the broader financial system. Issuers are mostly overseen by state regulators under a range of regimes, yet stablecoins are a key bridge between new and traditional markets and volatility in crypto could lead to a bank run on these companies, potentially infecting wider markets.\par \par \uc2 The report also recommends legislation to increase oversight of crypto tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum that don't explicitly fall under the jurisdiction of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  or any other agency. A bill recently introduced by bipartisan members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture sought to address this gap by granting authority to the C.F.T.C. Treasury officials declined to endorse any particular legislation in a briefing with reporters, saying only that they are ''heartened'' by bipartisan efforts in Congress.\par \par \uc2 Regulators are also calling for new authority that would give Washington better visibility across the entirety of crypto businesses, including the ability to look at various, seemingly disconnected entities in order to better understand risks and conflicts. The report noted that ''crypto-asset businesses do not have a consistent or comprehensive regulatory framework and can engage in regulatory arbitrage.''\par \par \uc2 The report calls on lawmakers to create new rules that address how crypto exchanges and platforms expand, noting that many add services by acquiring intermediaries without considering conflicts and limits on business overlaps that exist in traditional finance, raising stability risks and potentially hurting investors.\par \par \uc2 The report noted that certain characteristics of crypto have ''acutely amplified instability'' within the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  ecosystem, including lack of basic risk controls to protect against runs, excess availability of leverage and prices that swing quickly and ''appear to be primarily driven by speculation rather than grounded in current fundamental economic use cases.'' Regulators also fear that risky interconnections between crypto businesses and a few concentrated providers of key services undermine the ostensibly decentralized nature of \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''These vulnerabilities are partly attributable to the choices made by market participants, including crypto-asset issuers and platforms, to not implement or refuse to implement appropriate risk controls, arrange for effective governance, or take other available steps that would address the financial stability risks of their activities,'' the reports states.\par \par \uc2 Treasury Secretary \uc2 Janet L. Yellen\uc2 , who chairs the panel, said in a statement that the report ''provides a strong foundation for policymakers as we work to mitigate the financial stability risks of digital assets while realizing the potential benefits of innovation.'' Officials hope the publication will serve as a guide for lawmakers and regulators as they develop a more comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto markets.\par \par \uc2 The government, unlike the crypto industry, doesn't tend to move quickly, but the report, which outlines both general principles and specific remedies, is a significant step, industry observers said.\par \par \uc2 In it, the F.S.O.C. recognizes the increasingly centralized nature of an industry that promotes decentralization and provides some of the clarity that \uc2 blockchain\uc2  businesses have been clamoring for, said \uc2 Eswar Prasad\uc2 , a \uc2 Cornell University\uc2  professor and author of ''The Future of Money,'' who engaged with regulators as they put together the report. ''It certainly moves us forward.''\par \par \uc2 Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said a cryptocurrency report ''provides a strong foundation for policymakers.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Not long after dropping out of college to pursue a career in cryptocurrencies, Ben Weintraub woke up to some bad news.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Weintraub and two classmates from the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2  had spent the past few months working on a software platform called Beanstalk, which offered a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency with a fixed value of $1. To their surprise, Beanstalk became an overnight sensation, attracting crypto speculators who viewed it as an exciting contribution to the experimental field of decentralized finance, or DeFi.\par \par \uc2 Then it collapsed. In April, a hacker exploited a flaw in Beanstalk's design to steal more than $180 million from users, one of a series of thefts this year targeting DeFi ventures. The morning of the hack, Mr. Weintraub, 24, was home for Passover in Montclair, N.J. He walked into his parents' bedroom.\par \par \uc2 ''Wake up,'' he said. ''Beanstalk is dead.''\par \par \uc2 Hackers have terrorized the crypto industry for years, stealing Bitcoin from online wallets and raiding the exchanges where investors buy and sell digital currencies. But the rapid proliferation of DeFi start-ups like Beanstalk has given rise to a new type of threat.\par \par \uc2 These loosely regulated ventures allow people to borrow, lend and conduct other transactions without banks or brokers, relying instead on a system governed by code. Using DeFi software, investors can take out loans without revealing their identities or even undergoing a credit check. As the market surged last year, the emerging sector was hailed as the future of finance, a democratic alternative to Wall Street that would give amateur traders access to more capital. Crypto users entrusted roughly $100 billion in virtual currency to hundreds of DeFi projects.\par \par \uc2 But some of the software was built on faulty code. This year, $2.2 billion in cryptocurrency has been stolen from DeFi projects, according to the crypto tracking firm \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 , putting the overall industry on a pace for its worst year of hacking losses.\par \par \uc2 Many of the thefts have stemmed from flaws in the computer programs -- known as ''smart contracts'' -- that power DeFi. The programs are often built hastily. And because smart contracts use open-source code, which provides a publicly viewable map of the software, hackers have been able to orchestrate attacks on the digital infrastructure itself, rather than simply infiltrating someone's account. It's the difference between robbing an individual and emptying an entire bank vault.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 DeFi\uc2  has introduced a whole other level for hackers to be able to access a platform,'' said Erin Plante, vice president of investigations at \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 . ''It's putting a lot of pressure on the space and restricting the innovation that's possible.''\par \par \uc2 The breaches have shaken faith in DeFi during a grim period for the crypto industry. An epic crash this spring erased nearly $1 trillion and forced several high-profile companies into bankruptcy. In August, thieves exploited a coding issue to drain $190 million from a company called \uc2 Nomad\uc2 . Last week, the crypto firm Wintermute said its DeFi division had been hacked, leading to losses of $160 million.\par \par \uc2 Tracking the movement of stolen crypto is fairly straightforward. Transactions are recorded on public ledgers called blockchains, which anyone can analyze to find patterns. But it's significantly harder to regain access to lost funds.\par \par \uc2 The hacks have prompted many DeFi start-ups to explore preventive measures, recruiting auditors to examine their code for vulnerabilities. Even as other types of crypto firms cut costs during the downturn, security and auditing companies have seen a huge surge in business.\par \par \uc2 ''This year was a good year for attackers,'' said Goncalo Sa, a founder of ConsenSys Diligence, which conducts code audits. ''That has definitely ingrained in the minds of people that security is something that they should take seriously.''\par \par \uc2 From crypto's inception, companies have struggled with security. In 2014, the first major Bitcoin exchange, \uc2 Mt. Gox\uc2 , was breached in a damaging attack that eventually led to the company's bankruptcy and the loss of billions of dollars in digital currency.\par \par \uc2 At the time, the industry was relatively small and uncomplicated. Now hackers can attack a wider ecosystem, including an experimental economy of crypto-based video games, decentralized lending projects and newfangled coins. Last year, a hacker stole $600 million from the DeFi platform Poly Network; the thief returned the money after negotiations with the project's leaders.\par \par \uc2 This year's hacks have caused far more damage. In March, a group sponsored by the North Korean government stole $620 million in digital currency from the Ronin Network, a DeFi platform that powers the video game Axie Infinity. Around the same time, a hacker exploited a software flaw in a DeFi project called Wormhole to abscond with $320 million.\par \par \uc2 ''Many people are putting up platforms with a known vulnerability,'' said Chris Tarbell, a former F.B.I. agent who now runs the cybersecurity firm NAXO. ''In a target-rich environment, criminals are going to be opportunistic.''\par \par \uc2 The Wormhole hack exploited vulnerabilities in a novel element of crypto technology known as a cross-chain bridge, which allows investors to switch back and forth between digital currencies built on separate blockchains. Some DeFi platforms facilitate these conversions to help people capitalize on trading opportunities; a trader who owns lots of Ether, for example, might want to use an application on another currency's \uc2 blockchain\uc2  without having to sell the Ether and buy the other currency.\par \par \uc2 The sheer amount of crypto flowing across these cross-chain bridges makes them valuable targets. A total of 10 hacks this year have involved bridges, leading to losses of $1.3 billion, according to \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The technology is ''highly complicated, and complexity is the enemy of security,'' said Steve Walbroehl, a founder of the crypto security firm Halborn.\par \par \uc2 Beanstalk wasn't built as a cross-chain bridge. But it had other vulnerabilities baked into its code.\par \par \uc2 The project's inner workings were almost comically obscure. A white paper outlining its mechanics consists of 61 pages of graphs, charts and mathematical equations (as well as a quote from Alexander Hamilton's letters).\par \par \uc2 ''The number of Pods that grow from 1 Sown Bean is determined by the Temperature -- the Beanstalk-native interest rate -- at the time of Sowing,'' reads one passage from a guide to the platform called the Farmers' Almanac.\par \par \uc2 In essence, Beanstalk allowed people to deposit tens of millions of dollars in virtual currency into a software system, which generated interest and helped maintain the value of a stablecoin called a bean.\par \par \uc2 The project didn't operate as a traditional start-up. Like many crypto founders, Mr. Weintraub and his collaborators -- Brendan Sanderson, 25, and Michael Montoya, 24 -- kept their identities secret, calling themselves Publius, an homage to the authors of the Federalist Papers. When the software was released in August 2021, users who deposited their crypto got votes in an investor collective called a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO, which had to agree to make changes to the software.\par \par \uc2 Beanstalk's collective governance was ultimately its undoing. In April, a hacker borrowed $1 billion of cryptocurrency from another DeFi project, Aave. The transaction was a so-called flash loan -- a lightning-fast process in which a crypto user borrows funds without posting any collateral, makes a trade and then immediately pays back the loan, keeping any profits generated from the series of near-simultaneous exchanges.\par \par \uc2 The code that Mr. Weintraub and his partners had designed did not have a mechanism to stop someone from using a flash loan to take over the platform. So the hacker used the $1 billion to claim a huge stake in the Beanstalk DAO, taking total control of the software's governance. Then the hacker transferred everyone's funds -- a total of nearly $200 million -- out of the Beanstalk system.\par \par \uc2 Panic ensued. ''I lost $1 million today,'' one Beanstalk user declared on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 . ''It happened through beans.''\par \par \uc2 Some users suspected that Mr. Weintraub and the other founders were behind the attack -- a classic ''rug pull'' in which a team of developers flees with investors' funds.\par \par \uc2 ''The pitchforks were out,'' Mr. Weintraub said. ''It felt like death.''\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, he and the other founders decided to continue the project. They reported the theft to the F.B.I. and held calls with Beanstalk enthusiasts to find a path forward. In an April post on the chat forum Discord, they also revealed their identities for the first time. It was a risky move: Even though the project wasn't a traditional business, they could be vulnerable to lawsuits from users or regulatory scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 Over the last few months, the Beanstalk DAO has worked to restart the project, recruiting \uc2 blockchain\uc2  analysis firms to help track down the lost crypto. The group also hired Halborn, the security firm, which is reviewing the code to eliminate any vulnerabilities. Beanstalk officially reopened last month.\par \par \uc2 Such comeback efforts are increasingly common in crypto. ''We've always been so transparent with the community that this is an experiment,'' Mr. Weintraub said. ''We're all figuring this out together.''\par \par \uc2 The stolen funds remain missing.\par \par \uc2 Kitty Bennett contributed research.\par \par \uc2 Kitty Bennett contributed research.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220930ei9u0002x\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 'Merge', a Watershed Moment for Crypto, Comes With Risks\b0\par\par\uc2 By Kevin Roose \par \uc2 1,427 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Crypto could use a bit of good news these days. And on Wednesday, it got some.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum, the most popular crypto platform, appears to have successfully upgraded its software architecture from a type of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  known as ''proof of work,'' which it has run since its inception in 2015, to a type of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  known as ''proof of stake.''\par \par \uc2 This upgrade, which came to be called, simply, ''the merge,'' is already being heralded as a watershed moment in the history of crypto.\par \par \uc2 Early Thursday, as the first proof-of-stake transactions were verified, dozens of Ethereum developers gathered on a celebratory Zoom call hosted by the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''This is the first step in Ethereum's big journey towards being a very mature system,'' \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2 , Ethereum's founder, told the group. ''To me, the merge symbolizes the difference between early stage Ethereum and the Ethereum we've always wanted.''\par \par \uc2 And many crypto fans hope that it will turn things around for the crypto movement, which has been besieged in the past year by trillions of dollars in losses, a string of major scams and hacks, and a new wave of regulatory scrutiny.\par \par \uc2 I'm not so sure it will. But before I tell you why, let's review some of the reasons that crypto supporters are celebrating.\par \par \uc2 First, it was far from a given that the merge would work. Switching a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 's so-called consensus mechanism -- the way that it processes and verifies new transactions -- is terrifyingly complex. (Some crypto developers have compared it to swapping out a spaceship's engine midflight.) Before the merge, nobody had tried such a maneuver on a crypto platform anywhere near Ethereum's size, and it took years of testing and research (and many, many delays) for developers to get confident enough to attempt one. Ethereum, which is open source, hosts hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency transactions, NFT collections and DeFi protocols, all of which could have been irreparably broken if the merge hadn't gone according to plan.\par \par \uc2 Something could still break in the coming days. But the merge appears to have gone as smoothly as Ethereum fans could have hoped.\par \par \uc2 The second reason crypto fans are happy about the merge is that the new Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2  is much more environmentally friendly than the old one. Ethereum used to be secured by a network of high-powered computers that competed against one another to solve cryptographic puzzles, burning vast amounts of energy in the process. Now, it will be secured by a process known as ''staking,'' which involves investors agreeing to deposit their crypto coins in a shared pool in exchange for a chance to earn financial rewards.\par \par \uc2 There are other benefits to the merge -- it's expected to make Ethereum faster and more efficient in the long run -- but the environmental footprint is the big, immediate improvement. According to crypto researchers, the new Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2  will consume 99.95 percent less energy than the old one. That's a huge change -- comparable to the entire nation of Portugal going off the grid, according to Digiconomist, a website that tracks crypto's energy consumption. And it should help industry advocates make the case that crypto can be green.\par \par \uc2 Third, many crypto fans are optimistic that the merge will be good for the value of Ether, Ethereum's native cryptocurrency. For reasons that are too complicated to get into here, running the Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2  requires destroying (or ''burning'') billions of dollars' worth of Ether every year. The new Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2  will still burn Ether, but it won't need to create as much new Ether to pay out rewards to participants. That means that the overall supply of Ether could shrink, increasing the value of existing coins. In addition, miners -- the people who ran those giant, energy-guzzling server farms under the old proof-of-work system -- will no longer be forced to sell some of their Ether to pay their electricity bills, which could result in more stable prices.\par \par \uc2 I've talked to a number of crypto industry leaders about the merge, and the general feeling they express is one of cautious optimism. It's been a brutal year in crypto, but now that Ethereum has neutralized one of the most common objections to crypto -- the enormous environmental toll -- they hope that at least some skeptics will come around. Regulators won't object as strenuously to Ethereum 2.0, they believe, and companies that experiment with NFTs and other Ethereum-based technologies won't face as much backlash.\par \par \uc2 But I'm doubtful that the merge will solve crypto's problems overnight -- and it may introduce some even thornier ones.\par \par \uc2 For starters, it's not clear to me that Ethereum's energy use was the biggest obstacle to mainstream crypto adoption. It's true that a lot of people who are opposed to crypto on principle tend to cite environmental concerns as a strike against it. But these days, a lot of people are skeptical of crypto for reasons that have nothing to do with energy. Maybe they know someone who lost a fortune betting on Dogecoin or Luna. Maybe all the stories of hacks and scams have scared them away. Maybe they're intimidated by crypto's complexity, or put off by the lack of obvious uses for it. Or maybe they're just philosophically opposed to a new form of money that doesn't have the backing of a government.\par \par \uc2 Right now, the biggest threat to crypto -- in the United States, at least -- is that the people who are in charge of regulating the industry seem to want to ban it. These regulators are worried about stablecoins, Ponzi schemes, state-sponsored ransomware attacks and investors losing their money to opaque crypto-lending schemes.\par \par \uc2 The merge doesn't address any of that. And while you might be able to change some politicians' minds about crypto by telling them that Ethereum now uses 99.95 percent less energy, I'm not sure it will move the needle at all with the people whose opinions matter most. For example, Gary Gensler, the head of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , didn't mention environmental concerns at all in an opinion essay he wrote for The Wall Street Journal last month about why the crypto industry should be more tightly regulated.\par \par \uc2 The merge could also stoke internecine tensions within the crypto community. Already, there are some Bitcoin fans -- ''maxis'' -- who believe that Ethereum's switch to a proof-of-stake algorithm was a calculated P.R. move designed to make Ethereum look good while throwing Bitcoin under the bus. (Bitcoin, which runs on a proof-of-work system, has no plans to switch to a new consensus mechanism, so its energy consumption is likely to stay high, at least for the foreseeable future.)\par \par \uc2 Because it is secured by investors staking large pools of Ether, rather than by networks of puzzle-solving computers, the new Ethereum could also increase the crypto industry's overall centralization, giving more power to large firms like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , \uc2 Kraken\uc2  and Lido -- and potentially making it easier for governments to crack down on Ethereum itself, by pressuring those firms to censor certain transactions. (\uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's chief executive, \uc2 Brian Armstrong\uc2 , has already said he will shut down the company's Ethereum-staking business rather than comply with government censorship requests, if it comes to that.)\par \par \uc2 And, of course, the merge won't put money-losing crypto investors back in the black or recover the assets lost by investors in failed crypto projects like Luna and \uc2 Celsius Network\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Make no mistake, the merge was a technological marvel, a genuine boon to the environment and a testament to the power of cooperative open-source development. I'm glad that it happened, and the developers who toiled away for years to make it work should feel proud of how smoothly it went.\par \par \uc2 But crypto will need more than a successful merge to turn its fortunes around. Sorry to take the fizz out of the champagne.\par \par \uc2 The original system for mining cryptocurrency, known as proof of work, relies on a vast network of powerful energy-consuming computers.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Can 'the Merge' Save Crypto?\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 812 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 September 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Ethereum, the most popular cryptocurrency platform, completed its much-anticipated switch to a more energy-efficient infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 The moment finally arrived, in the last minutes before midnight on the West Coast on Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 After years of delays, discussions and frantic experimentation, the popular cryptocurrency platform Ethereum completed a long-awaited software upgrade known as the Merge, shifting to a more environmentally sustainable framework.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum is arguably the most crucial platform in the crypto industry, a layer of software infrastructure that forms the basis of thousands of applications handling more than $50 billion in customer funds. The upgrade is expected to reduce Ethereum's energy consumption and set the stage for future improvements that will make the platform easier and cheaper to use.\par \par \uc2 Celebrations erupted on a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  livestream where engineers and researchers who worked on the Merge had gathered to mark the milestone. It was a rare moment of joy in a grim year for crypto that saw a devastating market crash drain nearly $1 trillion from the industry, forcing some prominent crypto companies into bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 ''This is going as well as it could so far,'' said Danny Ryan, an Ethereum researcher who has worked on the Merge, as he celebrated with a group of colleagues.\par \par \uc2 Crypto users were on the lookout for any glitches that could complicate the transition. A flaw in the Merge could imperil the broader crypto industry, upending start-ups and sending the market into a tailspin. The cryptocurrency exchange \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  announced in August that it would pause certain Ethereum deposits and withdrawals during the Merge as a precautionary measure.\par \par \uc2 In interviews before the Merge, Ethereum developers said they had prepared for snags, though they downplayed the possibility of a systemwide collapse.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want to claim everything will go perfectly without a hitch,'' said Tim Beiko, who works for the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2 , a nonprofit that helps maintain the platform. ''We're kind of confident we won't see network-level issues just because we've run through the thing so many times before.''\par \par \uc2 The technical details of the Merge are mind-bendingly complex. But, ultimately, the process boils down to a shift in how cryptocurrency transactions are verified.\par \par \uc2 In traditional finance, an exchange of funds involves an intermediary, like a bank, which verifies that one entity has enough money to make a payment to another.\par \par \uc2 Crypto was designed to eliminate such financial gatekeepers. So, early crypto engineers had to devise an alternative system to ensure that users had the funds they claimed to have. Their solution was called ''proof of work.'' Under that system, powerful computers run software that races to solve complex problems, verifying transactions in the process. The system is widely known as ''mining'' because the computers earn payments in cryptocurrency as rewards for the verification service.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin, the original and most valuable cryptocurrency, runs on a proof-of-work system. And, until the Merge, so did Ethereum. But the process is environmentally draining: To run all those computers requires an enormous amount of energy.\par \par \uc2 The Merge shifts Ethereum to a verification system called ''proof of stake'' that uses less energy. Unlike proof of work, the new framework does not involve an energy-guzzling computational race. Instead, participants deposit (or ''stake'') a certain amount of their crypto savings in a pool, which enters them in a lottery. Every time a crypto transaction requires approval, a winner is selected to verify the exchange and receive a reward.\par \par \uc2 By some estimates, Ethereum's shift to proof of stake will reduce its energy consumption by more than 99 percent. And the project's developers say the switch will make it easier to design future updates that minimize so-called gas fees -- the costs of executing a transaction in Ether, the cryptocurrency associated with the Ethereum platform.\par \par \uc2 The process of shifting Ethereum to proof of stake required years of intense study and debate. The platform was founded in 2013 by a teenage software engineer, \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2 , who remains one of the most influential people in the crypto industry. Ethereum is now run by a loose network of coders from around the world. For months, they have gathered on video calls streamed on \uc2 YouTube\uc2  to discuss the intricacies of the Merge.\par \par \uc2 The shift to proof of stake took so long partly because it required the construction of an entirely new \uc2 blockchain\uc2  -- the public ledger where cryptocurrency transactions are recorded for all to see. That new chain, the Beacon Chain, was unveiled in December 2020. A series of tests followed this year.\par \par \uc2 The Beacon Chain has now finally combined with the original Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , signifying the ''merge.''\par \par \uc2 The original system for mining cryptocurrency, known as proof of work, uses vast amounts of energy.

\par\par \uc2 ON TECH NEWSLETTER\par \uc2 Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU\par \b \uc2 Logging Off With Hope and Caution\b0\par\par\uc2 By Shira Ovide \par \uc2 1,289 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 September 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In Shira Ovide's last On Tech newsletter, she looks back at how the past two and a half years have shifted her thinking on technology.\par \par \uc2 I've had the opportunity to write the On Tech newsletter for the past two and a half years, and now that time has come to an end. This is my last edition.\par \par \uc2 I have been grateful to write what have felt like personal letters to you about the meanings, joys and frustrations of technology in our lives. We have been in this together. I will miss your voices in my inbox and rattling around in my brain with smart ideas, compliments and suggestions to do better.\par \par \uc2 I will sign off by returning to a familiar theme in On Tech that emerged in the first edition of this newsletter and many times since: Technology empowers us, but technology alone is not enough. We -- not technology products or the companies and executives behind them -- hold the power to shape the world we want.\par \par \uc2 My views on technology have been altered by the pandemic and other events since 2020 in ways that I still don't understand. I feel both more thankful for technology and more impatient about it.\par \par \uc2 Technology holds the hope of profound, positive change and often delivers it, but at times it falls short, partly because people behind the technologies we love sometimes can be too myopic and unimaginative about the complexity of our lives.\par \par \uc2 What do I mean? I recently sent a giddy ALL CAPS email to a colleague about a New York Times Opinion column by the health writer Libby Watson, who focused on the limits of \uc2 Amazon\uc2 's ambitions to make navigating American health care as convenient as shopping from our sofas.\par \par \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and its peers have done remarkable feats to change what it means to buy and sell products. But the promise of \uc2 Amazon\uc2 -ifying health care seemed simultaneously hopeful and hopelessly na\u239\'00\'EFve.\par \par \uc2 ''Any company claiming its innovation will revolutionize American health care by itself is selling a fantasy,'' Watson wrote. ''There is no technological miracle waiting around the corner that will solve problems caused by decades of neglectful policy decisions and rampant fraud.''\par \par \uc2 I'm not a health care expert, as Watson is, but I can grasp that bad technology is not really the reason America pays more for health care, for worse outcomes, than other rich countries.\par \par \uc2 Making Americans healthier demands smarter policies, a better understanding of why people mistrust health institutions, a recognition that changing the status quo will leave some people worse off, and a tackling of the financial motives keeping things the way they are. Making a better customer app won't fix this.\par \par \uc2 Over and over, I've written in this newsletter about crummy technology that is a symptom, not a cause, of broader structural failures in areas like health care, connecting more of the world to the internet and our interactions with government services. And that means that technology is just one piece of the solution to making things better.\par \par \uc2 Digital tools are table stakes now -- a necessity for any change. But to steal a line that I used in an early edition of this newsletter and think of as a motto for my work: Technology is not magic.\par \par \uc2 Advances in battery technology and solar energy innovations will help make our planet more livable, but they are one part of the difficult, collective solution to slow climate change. Firing satellites into space or expanding 5G wireless technology may help connect more people to the internet, as I wrote, but tech inventions are not sufficient to tackle all the personal, financial and social barriers that keep billions of global citizens from making the most of modern digital life.\par \par \uc2 It's great to imagine that better versions of cars will fix what we hate about transportation, but as I've pointed out, they might not.\par \par \uc2 We need better schools, better infrastructure, better workplaces, better housing and stronger human connections. Technology is a piece of that, but it's just one piece.\par \par \uc2 That said, we need the imaginations of technologists to help dream of better ways of doing things.\par \par \uc2 We know the strong bonds that we can build with people who are on the other side of a WhatsApp message or a \uc2 Facebook\uc2  group. My work would not be possible without having endless information one web search away and my colleagues close by on a video call. During the coronavirus pandemic, we have been able to muddle through partly because we have been able to socialize, shop, work and attend school through screens. That is a miracle.\par \par \uc2 I am also grateful for people in technology with the can-do spirit who keep questioning whether there is a better way. Why should we have to buy eyeglasses or hearing aids from expensive health care providers? What if cars didn't have drivers or traveled above the ground? What if digital calculations on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  could help us take power from gatekeeper institutions like banks and internet corporations? We need the digital dreamers and tinkerers, even if they go off the rails sometimes.\par \par \uc2 But I also worry that a belief in the power of invention will be an excuse to avoid the hard work of improving our relationships with one another, strengthening education and housing, making our planet healthier, and keeping us safe and secure.\par \par \uc2 It's up to us to take technology and run with it. We deserve to shape technology to serve our interests. And we also need to know when technology is essential, and when it is not enough.\par \par \uc2 ***\par \par \uc2 Thank you for reading. Endless clapping to all of the creative illustrators who have made this newsletter a visual delight. Thanks to Hanna Ingber, the On Tech editor, and our art directors, most recently Elana Schlenker and Alvaro Dominguez, for making our creation even better. It has been a thrill to be invited into your inboxes.\par \par \uc2 Our tech newsletter will be taking a hiatus. In the meantime, you can continue to follow my colleagues' excellent reporting on technology at NYTimes.com, and stay in touch with me on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Before we go ...\par \par \uc2 What if your smartphone lasted as long as your car? My colleague Brian X. Chen imagines smartphones with easily replaceable batteries and screens, cameras that can be upgraded and software updates that go on indefinitely. There is a path, he wrote, to a smartphone built for durability and sustainability that could last for 10 years. Brian tinkered with one phone that is trying it.\par \par \uc2 Teaching the next generation of information-savvy citizens: My colleague Tiffany Hsu wrote about educators who are trying to teach young people to sort out what is truthful information online. It's contentious and difficult work, Tiffany wrote, but media and information literacy advocates told her that people need help learning to filter the chaos of information online.\par \par \uc2 TikTok clones where there is no TikTok: India's government banned the TikTok app in 2020, and Bloomberg News reported that short video apps are now more popular there than ever. Indians have flocked to \uc2 YouTube\uc2  Shorts, \uc2 Instagram\uc2  Reels, India's Moj app and other services that have copied aspects of TikTok.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Crypto Group Sues Treasury For Blacklisting\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 482 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 September 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Tornado Cash was banned last month to prevent hacking, money-laundering and other cryptocurrency crimes.\par \par \uc2 A group of cryptocurrency investors sued the Treasury Department on Thursday to block government sanctions that bar Americans from Tornado Cash, a popular crypto platform that criminals have used to launder virtual currencies.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Western District of Texas, is funded by the cryptocurrency exchange \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , which has clashed with the federal government over its increasingly stringent regulation of digital assets. The suit argues that the Treasury Department overstepped its legal authority by banning Tornado Cash.\par \par \uc2 The Treasury Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 The department announced last month that it was placing Tornado Cash on a blacklist to prevent hacking, money-laundering and other crypto crimes. Industry groups reacted with fury, arguing that the crackdown would cut off access to a critical tool for preserving privacy.\par \par \uc2 A so-called cryptocurrency mixer, Tornado Cash is designed to make it harder for law enforcement officials and other observers to track crypto transactions. Every time two people exchange digital currency, the transaction is recorded on a public ledger called a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , which anyone can analyze to trace the movement of funds. But when people route their cryptocurrency through a mixer, streams of funds are combined to obscure where the money originated.\par \par \uc2 That makes it a useful tool for criminals. This year, a North Korean-backed hacking group used Tornado Cash to launder more than $455 million, according to the Treasury Department. In total, the department has said, the service has helped criminals launder $7 billion in virtual currency.\par \par \uc2 Crypto supporters argue that mixers are a neutral tool, often used by those who simply want to protect their privacy. One plaintiff in the lawsuit is a crypto investor who used Tornado Cash to send funds to support the Ukrainian war effort, hoping to preserve his anonymity and avoid retaliation from the Russian government.\par \par \uc2 Unlike some other crypto privacy services, Tornado Cash is not a traditional company run by a team of executives. It is a set of ''smart contracts'' -- pieces of code that operate independently of any entity.\par \par \uc2 That distinction is at the heart of the plaintiffs' legal argument: They contend that the Treasury Department lacks the authority to restrict access to a software program.\par \par \uc2 ''It's important that the law's distinction between people and code be respected,'' said \uc2 Paul Grewal\uc2 , \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's chief legal officer. ''If that disrespect is allowed to stand, there could be all sorts of other ways in which statutes are twisted and bent to apply to crypto in ways that they shouldn't be.''\par \par \uc2 A cryptocurrency ''mixer'' like Tornado Cash combines streams of funds to obscure where the money originated.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Kevin Smith revisits his convenience store characters, and his life, with this sequel.\par \par \uc2 These days more than ever, personal filmmaking deserves to be celebrated merely for manifesting itself. Which doesn't mean that personal filmmaking doesn't come in some confounding forms.\par \par \uc2 From his first feature, the very low-budget, black-and-white ''Clerks'' (1994), the writer-director Kevin Smith has only ever made movies about himself. Not just himself as a person, but himself as a sensibility: quick-witted, working-class, pop-culture-obsessive wiseass Jersey boy. In ''Clerks'' he put it across perfectly. In the film's second sequel, ''Clerks III,'' he is not nearly as deft.\par \par \uc2 Paradoxically, some of this is because of Smith's relative maturity. A husband and a father and a heart attack survivor who is now 52, he's got more on his mind than being a wiseass. Instead of following up the 2006 film ''Clerks II'' with more of that picture's profane exuberant absurdity, he brings back Dante and Randal and Jay and Silent Bob and does some stocktaking.\par \par \uc2 [Video: Watch on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 .]\par \par \uc2 The movie is bouncy at first, though the actors Brian O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson, so rawly naturalistic in the earlier movies, here seem like they're doing bits. Still, three words characterize the first third or so of the picture: not funny enough. As in, a new character is nicknamed \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 . Which is funnier than that character nicknamed Podcast in the most recent ''Ghostbusters'' movie, but, you know.\par \par \uc2 Randal has a heart attack, and, realizing he has to make something of his life, decides to direct a movie. About, yes, working at a convenience store. Not funny enough turns to often not funny, a star-studded audition scene (Ben Affleck! Danny Trejo! Freddie Prinze Jr.!) notwithstanding.\par \par \uc2 While Smith has often broken the fourth wall in his pictures, here he uses the make-a-movie plot to go big-time meta. But his idea of meta fails to split the difference between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the French New Novel. It has more the manner of a pinball in a machine that's about to enter tilt mode.\par \par \uc2 For instance, at one point the trench-coated Silent Bob, played as ever by Smith, breaks character and, as Smith the filmmaker, lectures Randal about the hideous color scheme of a shot he's framing. The joke falls flat, and not just because Smith's visual mode is rarely mistaken for that of ''The Red Shoes.''\par \par \uc2 The wobbly ending combines the confounding and frequently schticky meta mode with the forced sentimentality of that Nicole Kidman \uc2 AMC Theaters\uc2  promo. My rooting interest in Smith notwithstanding (full disclosure: I, too, am a wiseass Jersey boy), it made me wince.\par \par \uc2 Clerks III\par \par \uc2 Rated R. It's a Kevin Smith movie. Running time: 1 hour 55 minutes. In theaters.\par \par \uc2 From left, Brian O'Halloran, Jeff Anderson, Austin Zajur and Trevor Fehrman in ''Clerks III.''

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 At Last, the Merge: Will It Bail Out Crypto?\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,645 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 August 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The cryptocurrency industry has endured a terrible year. A devastating crash wiped nearly $1 trillion from the market, draining the savings of thousands of people. Several companies filed for bankruptcy.\par \par \uc2 Now the industry is fixated on a potential saving grace: a long-awaited software upgrade to the most popular cryptocurrency platform, Ethereum, which provides the technological backbone for thousands of crypto projects. The upgrade -- known as the Merge -- has gained near-mythical status after years of delays that left some insiders questioning whether it would ever happen.\par \par \uc2 But if all goes according to plan, the Merge will take place around Sept. 15, more than eight years after it was initially discussed. The change would shift Ethereum to a more energy-efficient infrastructure, addressing the widespread criticism that crypto's climate impact outweighs its possible benefits. And it would lay the foundation for future upgrades to reduce the hefty fees required to conduct transactions in Ether, the platform's signature currency and the second-most valuable digital asset after Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 ''This transition is essentially laying a road map to a future which is far more scalable, far more energy efficient and a lot more usable to the normal person,'' said Joseph Ayoub, an analyst at \uc2 Citi\uc2  who has studied the Merge. ''It's laying the groundwork for adoption.''\par \par \uc2 But the risks are profound. Even by crypto standards, the process is almost ludicrously complicated.\par \par \uc2 For months, insiders have engaged in frantic, jargon-heavy discussions of developments such as the Goerli Testnet Merge and the Beacon Chain's Bellatrix upgrade, crucial software changes leading up to the main event. A botched Merge would imperil the thousands of crypto applications that operate using Ethereum, which collectively handle more than $50 billion in user funds.\par \par \uc2 ''It's flying the jet, and changing the engine in the sky,'' said Chandler Guo, a crypto industry veteran who leads a group opposing the Merge. ''It's very difficult. It's very dangerous.''\par \par \uc2 Ethereum is a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , a publicly viewable ledger where exchanges of digital coins are recorded. Transactions on the chain are conducted in Ether.\par \par \uc2 The platform was started in 2013 by a teenage programmer, \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2 , who is now regarded as one of the industry's elder statesmen. Mr. Buterin wanted to create a crypto system that was more flexible than Bitcoin and could instantly execute financial contracts and other complex forms of exchange.\par \par \uc2 Ethereum's design allows it to support a range of financial engineering. Programmers can build applications using the software to perform more complicated tasks than simple money transfers. Thousands of businesses and projects in the experimental world of decentralized finance now use the platform to offer lending, borrowing and other sophisticated investment options. Many nonfungible tokens -- the unique digital collectibles known as NFTs -- are built on Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 At its core, the Merge is a change to Ethereum's verification system. When someone sends money in a traditional transaction, a bank serves as the middleman, verifying that one person has sufficient funds to pay someone else.\par \par \uc2 Crypto operates without that middleman. In this alternate financial system, transactions are verified by a scattered network of computers. Anyone can plug a machine into the network by running software that solves complex puzzles, an energy-guzzling process for confirming transactions. Essentially, the computers are racing one another: When the puzzle is solved, the winning participants are rewarded with new coins in the digital currency they are verifying.\par \par \uc2 This verification process is widely known as crypto mining and has the technical name ''proof of work.'' By some estimates, the amount of energy consumed each year in mining is comparable to the annual emissions of entire countries.\par \par \uc2 The Merge is set to shift Ethereum to an alternate framework called ''proof of stake,'' which requires less energy. In a proof-of-stake system, computers don't burn energy racing to verify transactions. Instead, crypto investors deposit a certain number of digital coins in a shared pool, which enters them into a lottery. Each time an exchange happens, a participant is selected from the lottery to verify the transaction and win the rewards.\par \par \uc2 The shift is expected to cut Ethereum's energy use by more than 99 percent, which crypto boosters hope will make the technology more popular.\par \par \uc2 ''The difference in hardware and energy consumption is so significant,'' said Preston Van Loon, a developer working on the Merge. ''When NFTs were blowing up, people were saying, 'I'd love to have an NFT, but it feels like I'm burning a forest down.'''\par \par \uc2 Switching to proof of stake could also help solve another of Ethereum's biggest problems: the substantial fees required to use the network. Ethereum can handle only a certain amount of activity at a time, so when there's demand for the platform, the price of using it goes up. Anyone sending Ether must pay a ''gas fee'' -- a transaction charge that at times has risen as high as $200.\par \par \uc2 The Merge won't eliminate that problem immediately, but developers say it will lay critical groundwork for future upgrades designed to minimize fees.\par \par \uc2 But a change on this scale could also make Ethereum vulnerable to hacks or other disruptions, some crypto experts say. ''Any time you're making changes to a complex system, there must necessarily arise unintended consequences,'' said Christopher Calicott, a crypto venture investor.\par \par \uc2 Much of the criticism is fueled at least partly by self-interest. Many of the Merge's most vocal opponents are businesses that have built expensive data centers to mine Ether in the proof-of-work system.\par \par \uc2 The Merge's origins date to the time of Ethereum's creation. Mr. Buterin raised the possibility of switching to proof of stake in 2014, but at that point, the system was untested. The most successful cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which uses proof of work.\par \par \uc2 Since then, many newer cryptocurrencies have used proof of stake successfully. Ethereum programmers have been working in earnest on the switch for at least four years. The work is complex, and progress has been slow. Engineers had to construct a new \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , and run tests to check for security holes or other technological bugs that might disrupt the transition.\par \par \uc2 A nonprofit called the \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2  helps supervise the platform. But in reality, Ethereum is run by a loose group of engineers across the world; no top-down authority orchestrated the Merge. Periodically, programmers get together on publicly streamed video calls to debate technical aspects of the shift.\par \par \uc2 At one point, the shift to proof of stake was supposed to happen as early as 2016. As the Merge came together this year, crypto enthusiasts expected a June launch date. Then the Merge was pushed back to August. Now it's set for next month.\par \par \uc2 In the crypto world, the delays became a kind of joke. Early on, engineers installed what's known as a ''difficulty bomb'' in Ethereum's code. It was designed to keep them honest: After a set amount of time, the bomb would go off, causing disruptions in the Ethereum network unless it was switched to proof of stake. But every time the bomb was supposed to go off, the engineers created a new bit of code to defuse it, somewhat defeating the point.\par \par \uc2 ''We're not doing this lightly,'' said Danny Ryan, an \uc2 Ethereum Foundation\uc2  researcher who has worked on the platform since 2017. ''There's been countless amount of engineering and testing and academic vetting.''\par \par \uc2 In December 2020, Ethereum programmers took a big step toward the Merge by releasing a crypto platform called the Beacon Chain, a proof-of-stake system designed to provide the foundation for an upgraded Ethereum. After two years of testing, the Beacon Chain is finally set to integrate with Ethereum in mid-September -- the merge that gives the process its name.\par \par \uc2 As the Merge draws nearer, companies and entrepreneurs with a financial stake in Ethereum mining are growing increasingly concerned. Crypto mining has become a multibillion-dollar business, dominated by publicly traded companies.\par \par \uc2 In a recent corporate report, \uc2 Hive \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 , a crypto mining firm that draws revenue from both Bitcoin and Ethereum, said a switch to proof of stake ''may render our mining business less competitive or less profitable.'' Hive did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Some Ethereum miners are fighting back. Mr. Guo, who used to run an Ethereum mining operation in China, has mobilized a group of engineers who are working on an alternate currency to rival the upgraded Ether.\par \par \uc2 Despite the pushback, the Merge appears close to completion. A final test, known as the Goerli merge, was finished successfully this month.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Ryan, the Ethereum researcher, said he planned to gather in person with some colleagues to mark the actual Merge, the culmination of five years of his professional life.\par \par \uc2 Planning the celebration is complicated. While developers have estimated a Sept. 15 date, the Merge's precise timing is uncertain and subject to complex technical factors. Any glitch could cause another delay.\par \par \uc2 ''This might happen at 4 in the morning. It might happen at 2 in the afternoon,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''But I'll definitely be awake.''\par \par \uc2 Banks of computers mining cryptocurrencies. The Merge would shift Ethereum to an infrastructure that could cut energy use by more than 99 percent.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 The Corporate Lobbyist Who Opened a Bookstore\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ezra Marcus \par \uc2 2,362 \uc2 words\par \uc2 14 August 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Sitting at the bar in the exclusive Delta Club at Citi Field, where his beloved Mets were in the process of sweeping the \uc2 Yankees\uc2  in the Subway Series, the political fixer and venture capitalist Bradley Tusk described his designs on the future.\par \par \uc2 He talked up his $10 million philanthropic campaign to build a system that would allow all Americans to vote on their phones; so far, the campaign has funded pilot programs in seven states. He enthused over an investment proposal from a Native American tribe to transform its South Carolina reservation into the ''Delaware of web3.'' He pointed out a massive blue billboard in the outfield advertising the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  firm Tezos, one of many financial technology companies he advises.\par \par \uc2 But his latest project is set firmly in the present and relies on very old technology. Mr. Tusk, 48, has opened a brick-and-mortar bookstore -- one that he is marketing as family-owned and independent, a shift away from his longstanding identity as one of New York City's premier corporate fixers.\par \par \uc2 The bookshop, P&T Knitwear, sits on a stretch of blocks packed wall to wall with stores aimed at tourists and 20-somethings: clothing boutiques selling secondhand streetwear, restaurants lit with garish neon signs and quasi-legal weed dispensaries. The new shop shares an address with the \uc2 Hotel Indigo\uc2 , whose fancy rooftop club, Mr. Purple, is popular with TikTok influencers.\par \par \uc2 The 3,000-square-foot space offers 10,000 books and a cafe, as well as a podcast studio and an 80-seat amphitheater for readings and book releases. Upcoming readings feature the kind of writers you would see on any indie bookstore's events calendar, like the debut novelist Mecca Jamilah Sullivan and the poet Topaz Winters. At one recent talk, the novelists Kevin Nguyen and YZ Chin answered uncanny questions from the GPT-3 artificial intelligence program (''Who are your influences?'') projected on a screen above their heads, to the amusement of a youngish crowd with an array of literary tote bags.\par \par \uc2 But the store also recently hosted a book party to celebrate a new memoir by Lis Smith, the political strategist who managed \uc2 Pete Buttigieg\uc2 's presidential campaign and who dated former Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York in his post-scandal years. The crowd included the CNN host Brian Stelter; the political and corporate publicists Risa Heller and Stu Loeser; and Matthew Hiltzik, another communications fixer whose clients have included the likes of \uc2 Hillary Clinton\uc2 , Glenn Beck and Johnny Depp.\par \par \uc2 The political crowd was a more familiar one than the literary crowd for Mr. Tusk, who spent his formative years clawing his way up the pecking order of Democratic politics. Along the way, he developed high-level government connections and a nuanced feel for the levers of urban power, which served him well when he transitioned to working as a consultant and lobbyist for private companies battling regulators.\par \par \uc2 In college, Mr. Tusk interned for Mayor \uc2 Ed Rendell\uc2  of Philadelphia and went on to work for Senator \uc2 Chuck Schumer\uc2  of New York. He also served as the deputy governor for Gov. \uc2 Rod Blagojevich\uc2  of Illinois, who was later disgraced, until 2006. After a stint at \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2 , shortly before it imploded, he was tapped to run \uc2 Michael Bloomberg\uc2 's campaign for a third term for New York City mayor in 2009. He became an influential adviser to Mr. Bloomberg after his victory; the mayor, in turn, became a mentor to Mr. Tusk. In 2010, soon after the campaign, he started his own public relations and lobbying firm, Tusk Strategies. ''We're expensive. We're intense,'' its website reads.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  administration was synonymous with ''corporate power,'' said Michael Krasner, a former professor of political science at Queens College and the co-director of the Taft Institute for Government and Civic Education. The mayor's pro-development policies, including tax breaks for large businesses, profoundly changed the character of the city. Critics have long accused the \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  administration -- which presided over 120 rezonings and the construction of more than 40,000 buildings -- of ushering in an era of extreme inequality, when huge glass towers went up and New York transformed into a soulless ''Potemkin village of what the city used to be,'' as the historian Jeremiah Moss argues in his book ''Vanishing New York.'' Between 2000 and 2010, the number of bookstores in Manhattan reportedly declined from 204 to 135.\par \par \uc2 The bookstore, which opened in May, is the culmination of what Mr. Tusk describes as a lifelong love affair with the written word. Books offered Mr. Tusk ''sanctuary,'' he said, from bullies during his middle-class upbringing on Long Island and in Sheepshead Bay in New York. He majored in creative writing at the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2  before pursuing politics.\par \par \uc2 ''My thought was, I was a good enough writer to make a living writing sitcoms, that was kind of my talent,'' he said. (Mr. Tusk has never written for a sitcom.) ''I'm never going to win a National Book Award. I would never win the Nobel Prize. I would never write a best seller.''\par \par \uc2 Over the last decade, he has returned to writing, penning regular columns in business publications like Inc. and Fast Company. (A recent headline: ''We need to put regulations on the metaverse now. Here's where to start.'') He also published a memoir in 2018 titled ''The Fixer: My Adventures Saving Start-Ups From Death by Politics.'' It has sold 3,921 copies, according to Nielsen BookScan, though that number might soon tick up: On a recent visit to the shop, the book was prominently featured in the New York City section, its bright yellow cover facing outward.\par \par \uc2 The title of the book is a reference to Mr. Tusk's time working for the \uc2 Uber\uc2  founder \uc2 Travis Kalanick\uc2 , who hired Mr. Tusk for counsel in 2010 as his start-up battled local governments and taxi companies, including in New York. Mr. Tusk lobbied on \uc2 Uber\uc2 's behalf for the next five years and helped the company steamroll regulation efforts by Mayor \uc2 Bill de Blasio\uc2  and the City Council, enlisting drivers and riders to pressure the city. At one point, the \uc2 Uber\uc2  app even added a mocking ''de Blasio mode'' button, which changed the estimated wait time for a ride to 25 minutes and encouraged riders to ''Say 'NO' to de Blasio's \uc2 Uber\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk was paid in equity, which was reported to be worth around $100 million after \uc2 Uber\uc2  went public; in 2017, he sold most of his stake to a consortium of investors led by \uc2 SoftBank\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''His fight to get \uc2 Uber\uc2  established in the city married his new venture capital orientation with old-fashioned political moves, and brought about a victory that's probably terrible for air quality and traffic congestion, but pretty awesome for Brad Tusk,'' Errol Louis, the host of ''Inside City Hall'' at NY1 and a columnist for New York Magazine, wrote in an email.\par \par \uc2 The experience left a deep impression on Mr. Tusk; he is working on his first novel, which follows ''a campaign to legalize flying cars in New York, L.A. and Austin,'' he said. ''On one side are the V.C.s and the start-ups and their political team,'' he continued. ''On the other side are \uc2 Uber\uc2  and taxis united against it, with the Audubon Society, the transit unions, the socialists and the Russian mob.'' His agent is sending the manuscript to publishers this month.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk's ride-share windfall provided the seed money for an investment fund, Tusk Venture Partners, which he founded in 2016. It also burnished his reputation with potential clients -- often young start-ups navigating the choppy waters of regulation, such as Eaze, a cannabis firm, and \uc2 FanDuel\uc2 , a sports betting platform.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr. Tusk briefly dipped back into politics to help guide an unsuccessful New York City mayoral run by Andrew Yang, the politician who perhaps most closely shares his corporate-friendly, technocratic belief in solving social problems with private sector innovation. (The campaign was managed by Sasha Ajuha, who worked for Tusk Strategies at the time, and Chris Coffey, the firm's chief executive; Mr. Tusk called Mr. Yang an ''empty vessel'' at one point during the campaign.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk's dalliance with New York's literary scene began during the early days of the pandemic in 2020, when he and Howard Wolfson -- a friend and another former Bloomberg consigliere -- started the Gotham Book Prize, which awards $50,000 annually to the author of a book about the city. The first winner was the novel ''Deacon King Kong'' by James McBride in 2021, followed by the \uc2 New York Times\uc2  reporter Andrea Elliott's nonfiction book ''Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival and Hope in an American City'' this year.\par \par \uc2 ''Our thinking,'' Mr. Tusk said, ''was if New York can maintain the mystique of being the place that talented people from all over the world, of any background, say, 'I want to be there,' the city's always going to be OK.''\par \par \uc2 Later in 2020, with commercial rents tanking, he saw an opportunity to expand his literary footprint.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk landed on the peculiar name of what would become his bookstore through serendipity. In 1952, Mr. Tusk's grandfather Hymie Tusk and a partner named Mike Pudlo, both Holocaust survivors, opened a clothing store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Early on in the process, Mr. Tusk texted his father to ask where in the area his grandfather's store had been -- just around the corner on Allen Street, it turned out. He asked for its name. ''P&T Knitwear,'' his father wrote, adding, ''But you can't name a bookstore P&T Knitwear.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk's response: ''We are now definitely calling this thing P&T Knitwear.''\par \par \uc2 It's a transitional moment for New York bookstores. New shops -- like Yu & Me Books in Chinatown and Leaves in Greenpoint -- have opened, while beloved haunts like Unoppressive Non-Imperialist Bargain Books in Greenwich Village have gone under, courtesy of the pandemic's decimation of foot traffic and the surging rents that followed. Selling books is a low-margin business sensitive to economic turbulence.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk's store, though, is safe from market pressures: He is fine with losing money for the foreseeable future, he said. ''I'm much more empathetic to bookstore owners than I was before,'' he said, ''because we don't have to make it on the merits here.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's certainly a different way of going about it,'' Jessica Stockton-Bagnulo, the owner of Greenlight Books, said in an interview. ''Most of the bookstore owners I know are making their living from the store.'' But, she added, she had ''no beef with doing it that way either.''\par \par \uc2 Running the bookstore, Mr. Tusk said, is his way of giving back to the city. ''If the community feels like they really got something of value, and people feel like it's a place on their itinerary, and we're not losing tons of money, that would be awesome,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 It is an approach that he said was inspired by Mr. \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2 's philanthropic and political ventures that satisfy ''an obligation to society.''\par \par \uc2 To up the civic value, Mr. Tusk built a podcast studio that is free for anyone to use. (He records his own tech podcast, ''Firewall,'' there.)\par \par \uc2 ''I'd love it to just be one of those places that every guidebook in New York City says, 'You got to stop by P&T Knitwear,' and people say, 'I love hanging out there,''' Mr. Tusk said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Tusk characterized the store as a ''microcosm'' of one of his favorite policy proposals: universal basic income, which he has advocated at length, especially through Mr. Yang's mayoral campaign. P&T Knitwear offers higher wages than other bookstores do, he said, and provides workers with the same extensive health benefits given to employees at his venture fund.\par \par \uc2 Of course, wages and regular government paychecks are different, but Mr. Tusk compared their underlying financial mechanisms: ''It's a wealth transfer from me to the employees,'' he said. (A spokesperson later clarified that the starting salary was $20 an hour, and that the company covered medical and dental care to the tune of $1,000 per employee per month. A review of job openings at several bookstores in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago found starting salaries listed between $16 and $18.50 per hour, and several people working in the books industry said Mr. Tusk's salaries did seem higher than they were used to seeing.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Krasner, the former political science professor, was skeptical of Mr. Tusk's beneficence. ''Historically, this sounds a little bit like Andrew Carnegie giving away shiny dimes and subsidizing public libraries,'' he said. ''All this happens after the fortune is made and after the social damage is done.'' Ms. Heller, the communications strategist, had a different view. ''It's a great New York store devoted to New York stories, what could be bad?!'' she wrote in an email. ''It's nice to see Bradley invest in the city when others are not.''\par \par \uc2 ''I've had all this luck,'' Mr. Tusk said. ''That's sort of the back story behind the store.'' He described a chain of good fortune, stretching from his family surviving the Holocaust and moving to America all the way to his decision to accept payment from \uc2 Uber\uc2  in equity rather than cash. The store is just one facet of a broad program of charitable works, he said, including pushing bills nationwide that mandate school breakfast programs and funding a soup kitchen on 16th Street. ''This is just one person doing whatever feels right to me,'' he said, ''but this is how I'm going about it.''\par \par \uc2 Right, P&T Knitwear, Bradley Tusk's bookstore in Manhattan, where his memoir, above, is prominently displayed.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Treasury Bans Crypto Platform Over Money Laundering\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 527 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 August 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The crackdown was the government's latest effort to rein in the crypto industry.\par \par \uc2 The Treasury Department on Monday prohibited Americans from using the cryptocurrency platform Tornado Cash, saying the service has helped criminals launder more than $7 billion of virtual currencies.\par \par \uc2 The crackdown was the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 's latest effort to rein in the crypto industry, as lawmakers and regulators grow increasingly concerned over the volatility of virtual currencies and their role in facilitating hacking and other crimes. Calling the platform a ''threat to U.S. national security,'' the Treasury Department placed Tornado Cash on a blacklist of entities, making it illegal for Americans to send or receive money using the service.\par \par \uc2 ''Despite public assurances otherwise, Tornado Cash has repeatedly failed to impose effective controls designed to stop it from laundering funds for malicious cyber actors,'' Brian Nelson, the under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in a statement.\par \par \uc2 Criminals have long used virtual currencies to transact anonymously, exchanging digital coins for drugs or other illicit wares. But the anonymity of crypto doesn't provide blanket security: Crypto transactions are recorded on publicly viewable ledgers called blockchains, allowing law enforcement officials to follow the money.\par \par \uc2 Platforms like Tornado Cash are designed to make that kind of tracking harder. These crypto ''mixers'' receive multiple streams of transactions, then combine them to obscure the origin and destination of the funds. According to the Treasury Department, Tornado Cash was used to launder more than $455 million in crypto stolen this year by North Korean-backed hackers called the Lazarus Group.\par \par \uc2 A message to Tornado Cash's official \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account was not returned. Roman Semenov, one of the company's three founders, did not respond to a request for comment.\par \par \uc2 Since its launch in 2019, Tornado Cash has risen to prominence largely because \uc2 blockchain\uc2  records show that hackers have used it to move stolen cryptocurrencies. In interviews, Mr. Semenov has defended the service, saying the software protects the privacy of legitimate crypto traders who could be targeted by kidnappers or thieves.\par \par \uc2 In a statement, the crypto advocacy group Coin Center criticized the Treasury Department's announcement, arguing that Tornado Cash is a neutral platform ''that can be put to good or bad uses like any other technology.''\par \par \uc2 ''It is not any specific bad actor who is being sanctioned,'' the statement said. ''Instead it is all Americans who may wish to use this automated tool in order to protect their own privacy while transacting online.''\par \par \uc2 As the market for digital currencies has grown, the federal government has increasingly cracked down on crypto companies, which are lightly regulated. Tether, a stablecoin company, was fined last year by the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  for misstatements about its reserves, while the Justice Department brought insider-trading charges last month against a former employee of \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , the largest U.S. crypto exchange.\par \par \uc2 The cryptocurrency exchange \uc2 Kraken\uc2  is also under investigation by the Treasury Department for possible violations of U.S. sanctions.\par \par \uc2  records show how Tornado Cash was used to move stolen crypto.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 People Flock to South Korean Crypto Event Despite Upheaval in the Sector\b0\par\par\uc2 By Jin Yu Young \par \uc2 466 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 August 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Falling prices and upheaval in the industry do not appear to have curbed Koreans' appetite for crypto, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  and all things web3.\par \par \uc2 When the South Korean cryptocurrencies Luna and TerraUSD collapsed in May, their failures contributed to a $300 billion loss across the crypto economy; public outcries for Do Kwon, the cryptocurrencies' creator, to go to jail; and multiple investigations. But that, and a broader ''crypto winter'' dragging down prices across the industry, do not appear to have curbed South Korea's appetite for all things web3.\par \par \uc2 Korea \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Week opened this weekend with more than 7,000 people registered to attend and over 120 speakers on the lineup. According to the event's chief executive officer, Jeon Seon-ik, this year's event was one of the largest of its kind in Asia, if not the world.\par \par \uc2 One of the keynote speakers, Seo Sang-min, who runs the Klaytn Foundation, a prominent South Korean \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company, attributed the event's popularity to a South Korean penchant for tech.\par \par \uc2 ''Despite the Luna-Terra crash, the nation is big on crypto and is one of the tech centers of the world,'' he said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2 , a co-founder and the chief scientist at Ethereum, the system that runs the world's second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, also gave a keynote speech. He emphasized the need to make crypto transactions more affordable for a wider range of users and promoting the benefits of a decentralized financial system.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency first surged in South Korea in 2017 after the country's largest conglomerate, \uc2 Samsung\uc2 , announced that it would find a corporate use for Ethereum. \uc2 Samsung SDS\uc2  was the first Korean enterprise to join the \uc2 Enterprise Ethereum Alliance\uc2 , which started in San Francisco that year to facilitate business transactions.\par \par \uc2 Since then, South Korea's crypto market has grown to be one of the largest in the world. The country's crypto assets grew to 55 trillion won at the end of last year, worth about $46 billion at the time, with more than 15 million registered users of trading platforms, according to the country's Financial Services Commission. A few years ago, the South Korean government adopted a more wary stance on cryptocurrencies, and even considered banning them. More recently, though, the government has moved to regulate the industry.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Seo believes that the government's shift in approach is an acknowledgment of the industry's potential. ''The metaverse and web3 have potential to be more than a means of investment, create new jobs and solve real-world problems,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Outside a cryptocurrency exchange in Seoul.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Ex-\uc2 Coinbase\uc2  Worker Among 3 Charged With Insider Trading of Crypto\b0\par\par\uc2 By Matthew Goldstein and David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 967 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 July 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The case is the first time criminal insider-trading charges have been filed that involve cryptocurrency assets, a U.S. attorney said.\par \par \uc2 Federal authorities filed criminal and civil charges against a former \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  employee and two other men in an insider trading case involving confidential information about cryptocurrency assets that were about to be posted on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's exchange, according to charging documents filed on Thursday.\par \par \uc2 The three men were involved in trades over 10 months using information about 14 listings on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  that generated about $1.5 million in illegal profits, according to federal prosecutors in Manhattan. The men were charged criminally with three counts of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.\par \par \uc2 The case is the first time the authorities have filed criminal insider-trading charges involving cryptocurrency assets, said \uc2 Damian Williams\uc2 , the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.\par \par \uc2 The prosecutors, as well as the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  in civil charging documents, said Ishan Wahi, who at the time was part of a \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  team that listed assets on the exchange, passed on confidential information about when some cryptocurrency assets would be listed to his brother, Nikhil Wahi, and his brother's friend Sammer Ramani.\par \par \uc2 Nikhil Wahi and Mr. Ramani used that information to buy the assets before \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  announced they'd be listed, the authorities said. After the announcement, the men sold the assets for a profit.\par \par \uc2 The alleged scheme came to light after \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  began an internal investigation in April in response to a post on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  about unusual trading.\par \par \uc2 Ishan Wahi booked a flight to India just before the company was to interview him in the investigation. The authorities said he had tipped off his brother and his brother's friend about the interview as well. Mr. Wahi and his brother were arrested on Thursday morning in Seattle. Mr. Ramani remained at large, the authorities said.\par \par \uc2 Lawyers for Ishan Wahi said their client ''is innocent of all wrongdoing and intends to defend himself vigorously against these charges.'' A lawyer for his brother did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Ramani couldn't immediately be reached for comment. The S.E.C. said that Mr. Ramani is a Houston resident but that it believed he was in India.\par \par \uc2 The charges suggest that federal authorities are prepared to crack down on illicit trading in the world of digital assets in much the same way they have pursued such crimes in the stock, bond and commodity markets.\par \par \uc2 ''Our message with these charges is clear: Fraud is fraud is fraud, whether it occurs on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  or on Wall Street,'' Mr. Williams, the U.S. attorney, said.\par \par \uc2 The S.E.C. said the cryptocurrency assets listed on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's exchange are considered securities and, therefore, can be regulated like stocks or bonds -- a stance that many in the digital currency world have objected to.\par \par \uc2 Last month, federal prosecutors brought an insider trading case involving the use of confidential information to purchase another kind of digital assets, nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. In that case, the authorities charged a former employee of an NFT marketplace with misappropriating confidential information about the timing of public listings for the digital tokens.\par \par \uc2 The S.E.C. did not file any enforcement action in the insider trading case involving NFTs.\par \par \uc2 The two criminal cases ''are just the beginning of the D.O.J.'s crackdown on insider trading in the crypto space,'' said Ian McGinley, a former Justice Department prosecutor. ''Both of these cases are for relatively small amounts, but D.O.J. brought them to send a message: They are watching.''\par \par \uc2 In a post on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's website, the company's chief executive, \uc2 Brian Armstrong\uc2 , said \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  had turned over information about the three men to the Justice Department and had ended Mr. Wahi's employment. ''We have zero tolerance for this kind of misconduct and will not hesitate to take action against any employee when we find wrongdoing,'' he wrote.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Armstrong took issue in the post with the S.E.C.'s decision to file civil securities fraud charges. He wrote that the assets on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's exchange are not securities and noted that federal prosecutors had not charged the men with securities fraud.\par \par \uc2 The move by the S.E.C. prompted a rare rebuke from an official with another regulator. Caroline D. Pham, a commissioner with the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , wrote on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that the S.E.C.'s complaint ''was a striking example of 'regulation by enforcement.''' Ms. Pham, who was sworn in as a commissioner in April after being nominated by President Biden, said the S.E.C.'s decision to pursue securities fraud charges in this case had broader ramifications for the crypto industry and the appropriate regulatory framework.\par \par \uc2 In response, an S.E.C. official said, ''The complaint speaks for itself.''\par \par \uc2 In an interview, \uc2 Paul Grewal\uc2 , \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's chief legal officer, said the company had a team of 50 investigators, including former federal prosecutors, who monitored suspicious activity on the platform. ''These signals that we're looking for are extremely faint in a very loud, complicated system,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The impetus for the investigation into Mr. Wahi was a tweet from an account under the name Cobie that used public transaction records to identify the suspicious trading.\par \par \uc2 When the charges were filed on Thursday, the account -- which is reportedly run by the crypto influencer Jordan Fish -- struck a modest tone.\par \par \uc2 ''Confusing that people actually read tweets from this twitter account in the real world and then do stuff about them,'' Cobie wrote.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Shannon Stapleton/Reuters FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220722ei7m00048\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Bitcoin Miners in U.S. Rival City's Energy Use\b0\par\par\uc2 By Hiroko Tabuchi \par \uc2 1,086 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 July 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The findings, by a congressional investigation, highlight how the surge in activity has caused consumers' electrical bills to rise and makes it harder to fight global warming.\par \par \uc2 Seven of the largest Bitcoin mining companies in the United States are set up to use nearly as much electricity as all the homes in Houston, according to data disclosed Friday as part of an investigation by congressional Democrats who say miners should be required to report their energy use.\par \par \uc2 The United States has seen an influx of cryptocurrency miners, who use powerful, energy-intensive computers to create and track the virtual currencies, after China cracked down on the practice last year. Democrats led by Senator Elizabeth Warren are also calling for the companies to report their emissions of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change.\par \par \uc2 ''This limited data alone reveals that cryptominers are large energy users that account for a significant -- and rapidly growing -- amount of carbon emissions,'' Senator Warren and five other members of Congress wrote in a letter to the heads of the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Energy. ''But little is known about the full scope of cryptomining activity,'' they wrote.\par \par \uc2 Research has shown that a surge in cryptomining is also significantly raising energy costs for local residents and small businesses, and has added to the strain on the power grid in states like Texas, the letter noted.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin have grown exponentially since they were introduced more than a decade ago, and in recent years, so have concerns over cryptomining, the process of creating a virtual coin. That process, a complex guessing game using powerful and power-hungry computers, is highly energy intensive. Worldwide, Bitcoin mining uses more electricity than many countries.\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, a group of congressional Democrats launched an investigation into energy use at the country's largest cryptomining companies. They asked seven cryptomining companies for data on their operations, and the group's findings, issued Friday, are based on the companies' responses.\par \par \uc2 That data showed that the seven companies alone had set up to tap as much as 1,045 megawatts of power, or enough electricity to power all the residences in a city the size of Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city with 2.3 million residents. The companies also said that they plan to expand their capacity at an eye-popping rate.\par \par \uc2 One of the largest cryptomining companies in the United States, \uc2 Marathon Digital Holdings\uc2 , told the probe that it operated almost 33,000 highly specialized, power-intensive computers, known as ''mining rigs,'' as of February, up from just over 2,000 at the start of 2021. By early next year, it intends to get that number up to 199,000 rigs, an almost hundredfold increase in two years, it said.\par \par \uc2 The company currently operates a cryptomining center powered by the Hardin Generating Station in Montana, which generates electricity by burning coal, the dirtiest fuel. But in April, \uc2 Marathon\uc2  announced that it would be moving those operations to ''new locations with more sustainable sources of power'' and that the company was moving toward achieving carbon neutrality. It did not provide further details.\par \par \uc2 Cryptomining companies are often located near power sources because of their heavy demand for electricity.\par \par \uc2 Greenidge Generation Holdings\uc2 , which operates a Bitcoin mining center powered by a natural gas plant in upstate New York, said it expected to ramp up its mining capacity tenfold in multiple locations, including in South Carolina and Texas, by 2025. But New York last month refused to renew an air pollution permit for the facility, calling Greenidge's cryptomining operations a threat to the state's goals to limit emissions of greenhouse gases in order to fight climate change. Greenidge has said it could continue to operate under its current permit while it challenged the state's decision.\par \par \uc2 Overall, the biggest seven cryptomining companies expected to increase their total mining capacity by at least 2,399 megawatts in the coming years, an increase of nearly 230 percent from current levels, and enough energy to power 1.9 million residences.\par \par \uc2 Some cryptomining companies say they operate using renewable energy. \uc2 Riot \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 , in the response it provided to the senators' request for information, pointed to its Coinmint mining facility in Massena, N.Y., which uses hydroelectricity almost exclusively. But its far larger Whinstone facility draws power from the Texas grid, which relies on coal or natural gas for more than 60 percent of its generating capacity, the letter said.\par \par \uc2 The company's chief executive, Jason Les, said in a statement that renewable energy in Texas continued to grow and that cryptominers had the flexibility to shut down during high periods of demand, relieving pressure on the grid.\par \par \uc2 Surging demand from cryptomining, meanwhile, has also been blamed for driving up local electricity bills. A study by researchers at the \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 , found that the power demands of cryptominers in upstate New York had pushed up annual electric bills by about $165 million for small businesses, and $79 million for individual households. That came out to about $71 a year extra for the average household, or about a 6 percent increase.\par \par \uc2 It was unclear how a recent slump in cryptocurrency prices would affect expansion plans. And the overall picture of cryptominers' energy use beyond the seven companies was also not clear.\par \par \uc2 Given these concerns, Senator Warren said in her letter, the E.P.A. and D.O.E. should work together to establish rules that would require cryptominers to report their energy use and emissions. That would allow the federal government to monitor energy use and trends with an eye to starting to regulate a largely unregulated industry.\par \par \uc2 The White House is also studying policy recommendations to lower cryptocurrency mining's energy consumption and emissions footprint, Bloomberg Law reported last month.\par \par \uc2 China's crackdown on cryptocurrencies upended the crypto world last year, triggering a mass exodus of miners. Data compiled by researchers at Cambridge show that the United States is now the world's largest Bitcoin mining hub, making up about 37 percent of the global hashrate, a measure of the computing power used for mining.\par \par \uc2 A Bitcoin mining facility in Texas.

While Crypto Crashes\b0\par\par\uc2 By Paul Krugman \par \uc2 934 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 July 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  speaks, it speaks in Fedspeak. A pithy turn of phrase or a striking metaphor can all too easily turn into a headline, causing big market moves and a public backlash. So dry technical language and euphemisms are usually the way to go.\par \par \uc2 Given this reality, the bluntness of a recent speech on crypto regulation by \uc2 Lael Brainard\uc2 , the Fed vice chair, is almost shocking.\par \par \uc2 True, Brainard didn't go as far as \uc2 Jim Chanos\uc2 , the famous short-seller, who called crypto a ''predatory junkyard.'' But she came close. The very first heading in her remarks was, ''Distinguishing Responsible Innovation From Regulatory Evasion,'' and she strongly suggested that much of the crypto universe is driven by the latter. Traditional banking is regulated for a reason; crypto, in bypassing these regulations, she said, has created an environment subject to bank runs, not to mention ''theft, hacks and ransom attacks'' -- plus ''money laundering and financing of terrorism.''\par \par \uc2 Other than that, it's all good.\par \par \uc2 The thing is, most of Brainard's litany has been obvious for some time to independent observers. So why are we only now hearing serious calls for regulation?\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrencies have been around since 2009, and in all this time they have never come to play a major role in real-world transactions -- El Salvador's much-hyped attempt to make bitcoin its national currency has become a debacle.\par \par \uc2 So how did cryptocurrencies come to be worth almost $3 trillion at their peak? (Two-thirds of that value has now vanished.) Why was nothing done to rein in ''stablecoins,'' which were supposedly pegged to the U.S. dollar but were clearly subject to all the risks of unregulated banking, and are now experiencing a cascading series of collapses reminiscent of the wave of bank failures that helped make the Great Depression great?\par \par \uc2 My answer is that while the crypto industry has never managed to come up with products that are much use in the real economy, it has been spectacularly successful at marketing itself, creating an image of being both cutting edge and respectable. It has done so, in particular, by cultivating prominent people and institutions.\par \par \uc2 I'm not talking here about the embrace of crypto by libertarians and MAGA types, nor am I talking about embarrassing episodes like that crypto ad starring Matt Damon. What strikes me, instead, is the extent to which crypto has gained a reputation for respectability through association with high-status institutions and individuals.\par \par \uc2 Suppose, for example, that you use a digital payments app like Venmo, which has amply demonstrated its usefulness for real-world transactions (you can even use it to buy produce at sidewalk fruit stands). Well, if you go to Venmo's home page, you encounter an invitation to use the app to ''begin your crypto journey''; in the app itself, a ''Crypto'' tab appears right after ''Home'' and ''Cards.'' Surely, then, crypto must be serious business.\par \par \uc2 Suppose you want to learn about crypto. Many famous universities offer programs, typically online subscription courses.\par \par \uc2 Suppose you want to know who's advising major players in the crypto industry. Well, the board of \uc2 Digital Currency Group\uc2 , one of the biggest players, includes a co-chair of the \uc2 Brookings Institution\uc2 's board of trustees and boasts a former Treasury secretary as an adviser.\par \par \uc2 Given this aura of mainstream approval, how many people would have been willing to believe that the digital emperor had no clothes? More to the point, how many would have been willing to accept a regulatory crackdown?\par \par \uc2 Why were these mainstream institutions and people lending cover to what is, as Brainard made clear, a highly dubious industry? I doubt there was any corruption (as opposed to what goes on in the crypto sector itself, which is overrun with fraudsters). Indeed, I know from personal experience that one can draw a paycheck doing what seems like honest work and find out only later that the people signing the check were scammers.\par \par \uc2 Still, there clearly were and are financial rewards involved. I don't know how much money Venmo makes from people buying and selling crypto on its platform, but it's certainly not offering the service out of sheer good will. If you want to take, say, M.I.T.'s online \uc2 blockchain\uc2  course, it will cost you $3,500.\par \par \uc2 The way I see it, crypto evolved into a sort of postmodern pyramid scheme. The industry lured investors in with a combination of technobabble and libertarian derp; it used some of that cash flow to buy the illusion of respectability, which brought in even more investors. And for a while, even as the risks multiplied, it became, in effect, too big to regulate.\par \par \uc2 One way to read Brainard's speech is that she was saying that the crypto crash offers an opportunity -- a moment in which effective regulation has become politically possible. And she urges us to take advantage of this moment, before crypto stops being a mere casino and becomes a threat to financial stability.\par \par \uc2 That's very good advice. I hope the Fed and other policymakers take it.\par \par \uc2 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 At 21, she was a founding member of the Russian anti-government punk collective. At 22, she was imprisoned. A decade later, she's still fighting, this time using cryptocurrency to help her subvert the system.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm a super-introvert,'' said Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, one of the founding members of Pussy Riot, as the elevator zoomed to the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of Rockefeller Center, where the NFT Now gala was in full swing on June 21.\par \par \uc2 ''But it's a job. As an activist, you have to do it,'' she said of the schmoozing. ''You have to put your work out there.''\par \par \uc2 The doors dinged and slid open. As Ms. Tolokonnikova, 32, strode toward the entrance, the cacophony of hundreds of voices grew louder. ''But when I hear all this noise, my heart freezes a bit,'' she said quietly, switching to Russian.\par \par \uc2 She did not pause to collect herself. There was no time. Ms. Tolokonnikova, a musician, artist and activist who goes by Nadya, was in New York to mingle with the crypto crowd at a conference focused on NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Her schedule was packed with discussions, parties, panels and several performances.\par \par \uc2 Since being jailed for 21 months for performing a guerrilla-style piece called ''Punk Prayer'' -- which protested the government's cozy relationship with the church -- at a cathedral in Moscow a decade ago, Ms. Tolokonnikova has not gotten any quieter about her feelings toward the Russian powers that be.\par \par \uc2 She was released from prison in 2013, and the following year, she and Maria Alyokhina, another Pussy Riot member who served time in prison, founded Mediazona, an independent news outlet in Russia. In 2018, Ms. Tolokonnikova published a book, ''Read & Riot: A Pussy Riot Guide to Activism.''\par \par \uc2 In December, Russian authorities labeled her a ''foreign agent,'' a category used to suppress opposition figures. (As a result, she does not disclose where she lives.) After Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, Ms. Tolokonnikova led an effort to raise $7.1 million in cryptocurrency for medical aid in Ukraine. ''Putin is a bloody dictator, a terrorist who must be stopped as soon as possible,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In the years after she was released from prison, Ms. Tolokonnikova dealt with a severe depression and relied on art as a form of therapy. A classically trained pianist, she now makes music that zips across genres like pop, techno and punk.\par \par \uc2 On Aug. 5, Pussy Riot will release its first mixtape, ''Matriarchy Now!'' Ms. Tolokonnikova is the lead musician on the album, with the Swedish singer Tove Lo as the executive producer. Collaborators include Salem Ilese, ILoveMakonnen and Big Freedia.\par \par \uc2 Some of the other well-known Pussy Riot members, like Ms. Alyokhina, who recently escaped from Moscow by wearing a delivery-service uniform, are not on the mixtape. Ms. Alyokhina and others, but not Ms. Tolokonnikova, are performing as part of a multicity antiwar tour in Europe this summer. Ms. Tolokonnikova said Pussy Riot is a loose network with no hierarchy; there are no leaders, and anyone can become a member and use the name as part of their protest efforts.\par \par \uc2 On this rainy Tuesday in June, however, Ms. Tolokonnikova's presence in New York wasn't primarily about music. In March, Ms. Tolokonnikova and several partners created UnicornDAO, a fund-raising and investment vehicle built on a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  whose goal is to commission and buy NFTs made by women, nonbinary people and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community. She had come to New York to raise awareness.\par \par \uc2 So far, UnicornDAO has purchased more than 1,000 works by artists like Sofia Crespo, Claire Silver and Olive Allen, and raised $4.5 million in funding. The musician Grimes, who is a member of the DAO (it stands for ''decentralized autonomous organization''), donated an NFT of her work to the DAO's permanent collection, and the singer Sia is an active member.\par \par \uc2 After a quick lunch of seafood spaghetti and a few sips of an Aperol spritz at the Roxy Hotel, where she ran into the D.J. Steve Aoki, a friend, Ms. Tolokonnikova bounded over to Spring Studios nearby for brainstorming sessions hosted by ConsenSys, a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  software company.\par \par \uc2 During the cocktail hour that followed, a group formed around Ms. Tolokonnikova, with people asking for her thoughts about NFTs and fund-raising, or simply expressing their admiration toward her. She lingered for about 45 minutes, then made a quick exit.\par \par \uc2 On the way out, a fan requested a selfie. When people ask her for a photo, she said, ''they always say, 'I never do this.''' She paused, then smiled. ''That's what I said when I got a selfie with Bernie Sanders in Chicago,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Next stop was the gala, where the dress code was ''inspired.'' Ms. Tolokonnikova showed up in a uniform of sorts: black fishnets, white platform shoes, a short skirt, a ruffled top and finger-less gloves.\par \par \uc2 She called that day's outfit ''feminist superhero.'' The look's origins stretch back to when Pussy Riot started in 2011, when Ms. Tolokonnikova was 21. ''I was thinking that we would be something between Spider-Man and Catwoman and Sailor Moon, and maybe we would be the superheroes that will come and save everyone,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 At the gala, the mood was buoyant, seemingly unaffected by the crypto crash, which has led ordinary and amateur investors to lose large amounts of money and crypto companies to lay off employees.\par \par \uc2 For about an hour, Ms. Tolokonnikova sipped on a glass of sparkling wine and chatted with guests, including Joe Lubin, a founder of the Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2 ; the musician Miguel; and Michael Winkelmann, a digital artist who goes by the name Beeple. Mr. Winkelmann famously sold an NFT of his artwork at Christie's for $69 million last year and is a member of UnicornDAO.\par \par \uc2 ''She actually makes me feel lazy because every time I turn around she's started another DAO or a charity that's raised, like, $10 million,'' Mr. Winkelmann, 41, said. ''And it's like, 'What did you do?' I drew a bunch of pictures of wieners or something.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tolokonnikova said she gets along easily with ''crypto bros.'' ''The world of finance is super-toxic and a total no for me,'' she said. ''Crypto is a bit different. There are bros. Many of them are nerds. I myself am a nerd. We've always spoken the same language.''\par \par \uc2 Growing up in Norilsk, a city in Siberia, Ms. Tolokonnikova said she was the one who helped other students with their homework, in part because it meant they wouldn't be mean to her. Eventually, she studied philosophy at Moscow State University.\par \par \uc2 She said she realized the potential fund-raising capability of the crypto world when she sold an NFT for a four-part Pussy Riot video artwork series made in collaboration with several other artists for 178 Ether, or about $356,000 at the time.\par \par \uc2 ''This is life-changing money,'' she said. It was distributed among everybody who worked on the project and a portion went to a shelter for domestic violence survivors in Russia, she said. (Today, after the crash, the dollar value of the Ether they earned is significantly less: about $196,000.)\par \par \uc2 As an activist, she said she has always kept herself abreast of technological shifts like cryptocurrency, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  and NFTs because she thinks that these are new tools she could harness while the rules around their usage are still being understood and established.\par \par \uc2 The final stop of the evening was Bowery Ballroom. When the car pulled up to the club, she dashed in and reappeared minutes later onstage, performing Ms. Ilese's ''Crypto Boy,'' a tongue-in-cheek song about getting frustrated with a boy who is talking too much about crypto.\par \par \uc2 In response to the Supreme Court's leaked decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Ms. Tolokonnikova's UnicornDAO created a crypto wallet that makes donating digital currencies to a reproductive rights fund safer, anonymous and easier. The fund UnicornDAO is supporting is funneling money to seven reproductive rights organizations, including Planned Parenthood and Fund Texas Choice. So far, the fund has received more than $87,000 in donations.\par \par \uc2 Independently, Ms. Tolokonnikova teamed with Ms. Ilese to sell several NFTs of the song ''Crypto Boy.'' The money they raised, $170,000, went to the \uc2 Center for Reproductive Rights\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Ms. Tolokonnikova was not shocked by the Supreme Court's ruling, but she was deeply disappointed. With ''Punk Prayer'' in 2012, ''we loudly declared that the government and religion have no right to get involved in our decisions about our bodies,'' she said. ''Years later, the country that calls itself the leader of the free world is allowing a ban on abortion. It's really, really sad.''\par \par \uc2 ''Of course, it's just a drop in the ocean,'' she said of her fund-raising efforts. ''But I think that if we all make these drops and unite in one great ocean, then there will be a lot we could change and influence.''\par \par \uc2 Nadya Tolokonnikova had lunch at the Roxy Hotel before the NFT Now gala, center, at the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center on June 21. That night, she joined Salem Ilese onstage at the Bowery Ballroom, above.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Mr. Galloway, an outspoken N.Y.U. professor, speaks with DealBook about the crypto crash and what Silicon Valley will look like on the other side.\par \par \uc2 The DealBook newsletter delves into a single topic or theme every weekend, providing reporting and analysis that offers a better understanding of an important issue in business. If you don't already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here .\par \par \uc2 Scott Galloway\uc2 , a professor at \uc2 New York University\uc2 's Stern Business School and a co-host of the podcast ''Pivot'' with Kara Swisher, is notoriously outspoken. He has called the federal response to the pandemic ''a con,'' poured cold water on \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 's bid to buy \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and called \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  the most ''powerful, dangerous person in the world.''\par \par \uc2 Early on in the pandemic, he started writing a book looking at crises from 1945 to the present day to try to explain the momentous changes in our society and economy. Ahead of the fall release of the book, ''Adrift: America in 100 Charts,'' DealBook spoke with Mr. Galloway about what he had discovered about America during his research, and where he thinks we're heading.\par \par \uc2 The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity and length.\par \par \uc2 Your book suggests that the depths of recession could be a great time to launch a start-up. With all of the warning bells from markets and the Fed, should people be thinking entrepreneurially?\par \par \uc2 What the evidence shows is that it's actually a really good time to start a business. When you start a business in a recession, it's cheaper -- everything from real estate to employees to technology is less expensive. It sounds kind of counterintuitive, but building a business during a recession stress-tests the quality of the business early. It's like when you want soldiers who have been through combat -- a business that starts in a recession, if it survives a recession, it kind of battle-tests that it's a viable business. Then you have the winds of recovery at your back.\par \par \uc2 And coming out of a recession, companies and consumers re-evaluate their purchases and are much more open to new ideas and new vendors.\par \par \uc2 Speaking of a recession, what do you think \uc2 Silicon Valley\uc2  will look like on the other side of this?\par \par \uc2 What you have in a bull market, like what we've had in the last 13 years, is that the market responded positively to growth and that as long as you could increase your top line at a steady clip, the market, basically modeling \uc2 Netflix\uc2  and \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , said we liked this and kept bidding the value of the company up.\par \par \uc2 Now a couple of things happened: When companies like \uc2 Uber\uc2  look as if it's hard to imagine them ever being profitable on a sustainable business -- even with growth, and they have grown, it's still so far from profitability -- the market doesn't like that.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has actually lost more money in its history than it's made. And because of increasing interest rates, the cost of finance -- companies that are losing money or not profitable yet -- goes up because you have to borrow money at much higher rates. In addition, the profits you were anticipating in the future get discounted back at a much higher rate. In some growth companies, it costs more to finance what ultimately will be cash flows that are worthless. Their equity value here and now gets absolutely hammered.\par \par \uc2 What do you advise those companies to do?\par \par \uc2 There's no magic wand. It's cut costs. They're going to have to cut costs and, in some cases, adopt a business model such that they can get to higher prices and dramatically lower costs. And, quite frankly, convince the marketplace that they can get to profitability sooner, because the costs to finance that runway to profitability got much greater. So they need to show the amount of distance, the runway needed to get to profitability, is shorter. They basically have to trade off growth for a shorter path to profitability. That's what the market is telling them.\par \par \uc2 In your book, you take a look at how during every economic upturn, there's this optimism that we're going to solve inequality. But we always seem to come up short. Why?\par \par \uc2 We mistake prosperity for progress. And we have created tremendous, staggering, unprecedented prosperity. I think the mistake or the myth that we buy into -- that whenever there's prosperity economically, the G.D.P. grows, that it's going to translate to progress for a nation.\par \par \uc2 What do we mean by progress? I think the ballast -- and it's my first chapter in the book -- is a healthy and thriving middle class. The geopolitical power of a nation, its well-being, its democratic strength, is usually a function of how prosperous its middle class is.\par \par \uc2 Now the issue in America -- and Europe makes it to a lesser extent -- is that America has either believed this myth that the middle class is a natural-occurring object of a free-market economy, and it is not. The middle class is an accident. It is an aberration of economics.\par \par \uc2 There's a constant notion that if the economy does well, the middle class will restore itself. That is not true. What happens over time in all economic history is that the wealthy weaponize government, lower taxes on them, resist competition -- the biggest, most powerful companies entrench themselves, and you end up with an erosion of the middle class. You end up with income inequality. It gets worse and worse, and then the same thing happens with income inequality. The good news is income inequality, when it gets to these levels, always self-corrects. The bad news is that the mechanisms for self-correction are war, famine and revolution.\par \par \uc2 Unless you provide and invest in a strong middle class, whether it be the minimum wage or support of unions or vocational training or access to free education or reduced-cost education, the middle class, as an entity, goes away. We have fallen into this notion that as long as the economy does well, the middle class will do well. The two are not necessarily linked.\par \par \uc2 You were early in warning about too much pandemic-era stimulus having a bad impact on the economy. What should we have done differently?\par \par \uc2 We spent, at a minimum, $7 trillion -- but it was nothing but cloud cover where we threw some loaves of bread at and circuses to the poor so that we could massively stimulate the economy. The majority of the money ended up in the market, and who owns 90 percent of stocks in real estate by dollar volume? The top 1 percent. The P.P.P., the bailout of small businesses, was nothing but a giveaway to the rich. The richest cohort in America are, wait for it, the small-business owners. The millionaire next door owns a carwash.\par \par \uc2 This is the dirty secret of Covid. If you're in the top 10 percent, you're living your best life. Covid for you meant more time with family, more time with \uc2 Netflix\uc2  -- and you saw your stock accelerate.\par \par \uc2 When you flush $7 trillion into the economy and then you couple that with a war and supply chain eruptions, it seems obvious now: We have too many dollars chasing too few products. And of course the people who are going to be hurt most by inflation are the people who don't have cushions. We absolutely overdid it.\par \par \uc2 You've been a longtime skeptic on crypto, and now we are seeing a real crash. What do you think is going to happen next?\par \par \uc2 What we found is this whole mantra of a trustless economy, we shouldn't have trusted many of these new actors.\par \par \uc2 Even in '99, there were a lot of use cases of the internet -- you could buy CDs and books on \uc2 Amazon\uc2 . You could get real-time news on Yahoo. It's more difficult to find use cases from the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  that impact everyday consumers. I think you're just seeing a massive unwinding or de-levering of the space -- and I think we're kind of in the midst of a crash that will be likely unprecedented in terms of an asset class.\par \par \uc2 If you look at the bubble -- if you compare it to previous bubbles, whether it's tulips, internet stocks of '99, housing, Japanese stocks -- the run-up here was more extraordinary. The run-up here makes the other ones look sheepish or modest, which means that the crash will be equally or more violent.\par \par \uc2 There's going to be more lawsuits. There's going to be more calls for additional regulations. You're going to see investors say: Where were the regulators?\par \par \uc2 That's the bad news. The good news is it probably won't have much of an impact on the real economy. Keep in mind, even if all crypto went to zero right now, that's still less than half the value of \uc2 Apple\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What do you think? Do you agree with Mr. Galloway's predictions? Let us know: dealbook@nytimes.com.\par \par \uc2 Scott Galloway, a professor at New York University's Stern Business School, wrote a book looking at crises since 1945 to explain changes in our economy.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Ukraine's Tech Work Force Shifted to Safer Settings\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Segal \par \uc2 1,798 \uc2 words\par \uc2 20 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 How one Lithuanian company evacuated dozens of employees, three dogs and one guinea pig as Russia invaded.\par \par \uc2 VILNIUS, Lithuania -- In the mobile game Airplane Chefs, the player is a flight attendant rushing to microwave as much food as possible and serve it, just as efficiently, on a commercial jet filled with demanding passengers.\par \par \uc2 Hunting for bugs in this game is the job of Inha Kushnir, a member of the quality assurance team at Nordcurrent, the Lithuanian company that created and markets Airplane Chefs and a handful of other titles. Sitting in front of a desktop computer in Nordcurrent's surprisingly quiet Vilnius office, in a neighborhood that is a jumble of glass corporate towers and residential housing, Ms. Kushnir spent a recent afternoon looking for programming flaws as her online avatar zapped pizzas and loaded them onto trolley carts. The work is absorbing, which makes it a good way to focus on something other than why she's in Vilnius and how she got here.\par \par \uc2 ''Whenever I think about work,'' she said during a break, ''I stop thinking about what is happening in Odesa.''\par \par \uc2 Until late February, Ms. Kushnir worked in Nordcurrent's Odesa office. Then Russia invaded Ukraine, and she and her husband decided that it would be safer for her and the couple's young daughter to leave. Ms. Kushnir's husband, like nearly all Ukrainian men, stayed behind.\par \par \uc2 Now Ms. Kushnir is part of Ukraine's information technology diaspora, about 50,000 people, most of them residing in Poland, Germany, Spain, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands.\par \par \uc2 Before these workers relocated, they were part of one of Ukraine's largest service exports, with $5 billion in annual revenue, representing about 4 percent of the country's gross domestic product, the IT Ukraine Association says. The country has a very mobile pool of I.T. talent, nearly 300,000 people providing computer and coding services in fields like e-commerce, artificial intelligence, robotics, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  and so on.\par \par \uc2 When the invasion began, Nordcurrent, like dozens of other companies, improvised an evacuation plan for employees who suddenly lived in a war zone. There are 250 people on Nordcurrent's payroll, and nearly half were in Ukraine -- 90 in Odesa and 30 in Dnipro.\par \par \uc2 For Nordcurrent, which was founded in 2002, recruiting from Ukraine was simply smart business. Workers there tend to be proficient in English, the lingua franca of the company, and highly capable. (The country's emphasis on science and tech education is a legacy of years in the Soviet Union.) The risk that Russia might one day invade had been front of mind among Nordcurrent executives since 2014, when Russian troops annexed Crimea in the south of Ukraine. The threat was talked about so often that, paradoxically, it receded as a source of anxiety.\par \par \uc2 ''We decided to ignore it,'' said Victoria Trofimova, Nordcurrent's Ukrainian-born chief executive and the person who cobbled together and oversaw the evacuation plan. ''Even when there was talk about forces at the border of Ukraine, we decided to continue as usual.''\par \par \uc2 That approach ended the morning of Feb. 24, when Ms. Trofimova hit the snooze button on her alarm clock a few times before realizing the noise was coming from her phone. Her father was calling to say Russia had invaded Ukraine. She soon was in touch with Ukrainian employees, offering to help them flee. Most wanted to stay, but a few dozen decided that the country was too dangerous for them, or their parents or their children.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Trofimova's plan involved three bus drivers who made two trips, four days apart, as well as calls to the Hungarian Consulate, a handful of volunteers bearing insulin for diabetics and, ultimately, the safe passage of 51 people, three dogs and one guinea pig.\par \par \uc2 Among the biggest challenges was finding a bus because most had already been booked. After calling around, Ms. Trofimova found an operator in Romania willing to pick up her employees in Odesa.\par \par \uc2 ''Then I worried about passports, because not a lot of Ukrainians have passports because they have never traveled out of the country,'' she said. ''And we were getting conflicting information about whether people needed Covid vaccine certificates.''\par \par \uc2 They did not, it turned out. And the six-hour wait at the Romanian border was relatively brief, courtesy of Ms. Trofimova's decision to direct the bus to the tiny town of Isaccea, a somewhat obscure crossing point.\par \par \uc2 Nordcurrent employees say adjusting to their new setting has been relatively smooth, both because Vilnius is an easily navigated city and because the company is a family business that has done its best to embrace them. Ms. Trofimova founded it along with her husband, Michail Trofimov, and his brother Sergej, and their creations lean toward the whimsical, starting with their first title, Santa Claus Saves the Earth. Each month about 12 million people play Nordcurrent games, which are free to download and play. Revenue, which amounted to $64 million last year, is earned when add-ons are purchased, like better cooking equipment in Airplane Chefs.\par \par \uc2 The headquarters have a very un-corporate atmosphere. An aging cat sleeps on the sofa at the entrance of the office, which is on the third floor of a spiffy new building next to a cinema and above a coffee shop. Meeting rooms are named for the company's games, like Murder in the Alps and Cooking Fever. For distractions, there are table tennis and foosball in a snack room.\par \par \uc2 Like Odesa, Vilnius is a mix of the grand old buildings and Soviet architecture, and the country, which was the first of the 15 Soviet republics to declare its independence, has been welcoming to Ukrainians. A law that requires proficiency in Lithuanian for certain jobs was suspended to help the 50,000 refugees who have arrived here.\par \par \uc2 In the months since the fighting began, the exit of Ukrainian tech workers has taken them all over Europe and the rest of the world. Some are planning to return home; others hope to stay put. For two Ukrainians who left a few years ago and have settled in Berlin, the invasion sparked an idea. Nikita Overchyk and Ivan Kychatyi created UA Talents, an online portal for employers in search of Ukrainian I.T. workers. It's basically a matchmaking site, and it currently has 15,000 job postings.\par \par \uc2 The site's founders say anyone from Ukraine who joins them in Germany should brace themselves for culture shock.\par \par \uc2 ''This place is hugely bureaucratic,'' Mr. Overchyk said. ''There are a lot of rules, and you get three to four pieces of mail a week that you must respond to. Nobody in Ukraine communicates by mail.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kychatyi agreed.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of things just take too long,'' he said. ''Like getting internet service at home. That took a month. In Ukraine, that takes two days.''\par \par \uc2 There's a premium on beautiful design and ease of use in Ukraine that is missing from many websites in Germany, the men said. In Ukraine, if an aging site needs an update, nobody is sweating about protocol or rules.\par \par \uc2 ''We have no process,'' Mr. Overchyk said. ''We just get stuff done. That's the mentality that Ukrainians are going to bring wherever they go. 'We need this to happen. Help me make it happen.'''\par \par \uc2 This get-it-done ethos is reflected in many of the stories told by Nordcurrent employees who scrambled out of Ukraine. Nastya Dahno was an artist in the company's Dnipro office and met the second bus in the Polish town of Lodz. First, she had to travel by train from Dnipro to Lviv, a trip that, in the chaos of those first days of war, took 36 hours instead of the usual 12. It was a sleeper train, with bunk beds that were used like benches, seating four or five people.\par \par \uc2 The space was crammed, the doors were locked, the shades were drawn and blankets were draped over the shades. The idea was to reduce the light emitted by the train and limit the chance of being spotted by Russians, and to reduce the impact of imploding glass if the train was attacked. Everybody was instructed to keep quiet, especially when the train stopped at a platform.\par \par \uc2 The scariest moment occurred about 10 hours into the trip, in the dead of night, when the silence of a stop was shattered by a man pounding at the door, screaming, ''Let me in!''\par \par \uc2 ''We had no idea who was on the other side of that door,'' Ms. Dahno said (and she never found out, as it happened). ''We thought it could be a criminal or a Russian soldier. Nobody spoke. We were just silent.''\par \par \uc2 Most of Nordcurrent's employees, like most Ukrainians, stayed in Ukraine. One of them is Tatyana Margolina, the company's office director in Dnipro. Over a video chat, she recalled that President \uc2 Volodymyr Zelensky\uc2  had said early on that if everyone emigrated, the economy would collapse. A local government official then offered a gender-specific recommendation about how to spend some money.\par \par \uc2 Guys, go to the gym. Ladies, get your nails done.\par \par \uc2 ''Nail salons have become a place for therapy,'' Ms. Margolina said. ''The woman around here who does nails has also taken some courses in psychology. So her salon isn't just a place to fix your nails. It's a place to talk.''\par \par \uc2 As Ms. Margolina keeps the Dnipro office running, there is a new and unnerving dimension to her job: the sound of explosions. She hears them often, though even silence in a war is preoccupying -- for those in Vilnius, too.\par \par \uc2 Not long ago, Ms. Kushnir was on the phone with her husband when he heard bombs landing and said he needed to hang up and sprint to a shelter. Within hours, she read that three people had died in a house near a playground where Ms. Kushnir regularly took her daughter. They had perished, she quickly realized, in the attack that compelled her husband to hang up.\par \par \uc2 ''I can't understand this war,'' Ms. Kushnir said, removing her glasses to dab tears on her cheeks. ''Our lives were ruined, broken, and I don't know why.''\par \par \uc2 After leaving the Ukrainian offices of the game maker Nordcurrent, Nastya Dahno, above, now works at its headquarters in Vilnius, Lithuania. Her trip to the city from Dnipro, Ukraine, included 36 nervous hours on a crowded train. (B1); Victoria Trofimova, above, Nordcurrent's Ukrainian-born chief executive, arranged for the safe passage of 51 people out of Ukraine to Vilnius, Lithuania, including, at left, Nastya Dahno and Inha Kushnir, seated.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Bitcoin Plummets Below $20,000, Caught in the Undertow of a Market Meltdown\b0\par\par\uc2 By Erin Griffith and David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,179 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 19\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Its fall was accelerated in recent weeks by the collapse of two major cryptocurrency projects while sowing doubts about the stability of the overall cryptocurrency market.\par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO -- The price of Bitcoin fell below $20,000 for the first time since December 2020 on Saturday, amid a broader market meltdown driven by rising interest rates, inflation and economic uncertainty spurred by the war in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 The plunge -- it sank below $19,000 at one point Saturday -- took place over several months for Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency. Its fall was accelerated in recent weeks by the collapse of two major cryptocurrency projects, Terra-Luna and Celsius, while sowing doubts about the stability of the overall cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin has erased some $900 billion of value since its peak in November.\par \par \uc2 From March 2020 to November 2021, the price of a single Bitcoin rose twelvefold to $64,000. It passed its previous record of $19,738 in November 2020.\par \par \uc2 The drastic sell-offs show how intertwined and complex the crypto markets have become in recent years, said R.A. Farrokhnia, a professor at \uc2 Columbia Business School\uc2  who specializes in financial technology. As investors flee to less risky assets, ''this creates a cascade effect on top of the contagion effect,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Investing in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies surged in the pandemic alongside other risky bets on assets like ''meme stocks,'' collectibles including sneakers and trading cards, and digital art and media known as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. The speculation was driven by free-flowing stimulus checks, low interest rates on other investments, a social media frenzy, pandemic boredom and a fear of missing out on the next big thing.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin was designed to transform the way people do transactions. The digital currency relies on a decentralized network of computers that log each transaction on a permanent record known as a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . The record cannot be changed or controlled by anyone, including governments.\par \par \uc2 The excitement -- and potential profits -- generated by Bitcoin's rise attracted newcomers to learn about, work on and invest in cryptocurrencies. Some investors saw Bitcoin as a safe place to park cash after central banks flooded the economy with money, creating fears of inflation. Bitcoin has a built-in limit to its supply; there will only ever be 21 million of the tokens. Around 19 million have been electronically mined so far.\par \par \uc2 The run-up also pushed Wall Street and Fortune 500 companies to become more open to something they once dismissed. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  announced plans to offer wealthy customers access to cryptocurrency funds. \uc2 PayPal\uc2  and its subsidiary, Venmo, created options for trading and shopping with cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 Square\uc2 , another payments company, bought $50 million of Bitcoin and changed its name to Block, in part to signify its work with \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology. \uc2 Tesla\uc2  bought $1.5 billion of it. The venture capital firm \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  raised $4.5 billion for a fourth cryptocurrency-focused fund, doubling its previous one.\par \par \uc2 Excitement hit a peak in April last year when \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , a cryptocurrency exchange, went public at an $85 billion valuation, a coming-out party for the industry. Bitcoin topped $60,000 for the first time.\par \par \uc2 Last summer, El Salvador announced that it would become the first country to classify Bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the U.S. dollar. The country's president updated his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  profile picture to include laser eyes, a calling card of Bitcoin believers. The value of El Salvador's $105 million investment in Bitcoin has been slashed in half as the price has fallen.\par \par \uc2 Senators and mayors around the United States began touting cryptocurrency, as the industry spent heavily on lobbying. Mayor Eric Adams of New York, who was elected in November, said he would take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin. Senators \uc2 Cynthia Lummis\uc2 , Republican of Wyoming, and Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, proposed legislation that would create a regulatory framework for the industry, giving more authority to the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2 , an agency that crypto companies have openly courted.\par \par \uc2 Through the frenzy, celebrities fueled the fear of missing out, flogging their NFTs on talk shows and talking up \uc2 blockchain\uc2  projects on social media. This year, the Super Bowl featured four ads for crypto companies, including Matt Damon warning viewers that ''fortune favors the brave.''\par \par \uc2 That swaggering optimism faltered this spring as the stock market plummeted, inflation soared and layoffs hit the tech sector. Investors began losing confidence in their crypto investments, moving money to less risky assets. Several high-profile projects crashed amid withdrawals. TerraForm Labs, which created TerraUSD, a so-called stablecoin, and Celsius, an experimental crypto bank, both collapsed, wiping out billions in value and sending the broader market into a tailspin.\par \par \uc2 ''The circular flow of funds brings questions about whether this entire ecosystem always needs outsiders to come in and sustain it,'' Mr. Farrokhnia said.\par \par \uc2 Even as investing in cryptocurrencies became more mainstream, Bitcoin did not find much success as a means of everyday transaction. Its price swings are volatile, and its upward trajectory has made it more valuable to hold long term. Companies created elaborate ways to make loans or let people use their Bitcoin as collateral in a sector that is known as decentralized finance, or DeFi.\par \par \uc2 At just over $20,000, around half of all Bitcoin wallets were still sitting on profits, according to an analysis by the \uc2 Columbia Business School\uc2 . Mr. Farrokhnia said 61 percent of the addresses had not sold in the last 12 months, showing that many people bought into it to hold it.\par \par \uc2 Regulators have said cryptocurrencies enable tax evasion, risky behavior and fraud. Last year, China cracked down on cryptocurrency mining and trading, and regulators in Hong Kong, Canada and the United States have warned of regulatory actions. Britain has also banned \uc2 Binance\uc2 , the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin's widespread use by criminals, including the hackers who attacked the \uc2 Colonial Pipeline\uc2  last year, has generated further scrutiny. But Bitcoin's transparency -- the ledger is public for anyone to see -- has also helped prosecutors track down some criminals and even recover ransom payments.\par \par \uc2 The recent sell-off has led to cutbacks at companies that were in hyper-growth just a few months ago. \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  laid off 18 percent of its employees in June after posting shrinking revenue and losing active users. Other crypto companies, including \uc2 Gemini\uc2 , BlockFi and Crypto.com, have also cut jobs.\par \par \uc2 In past downturns, known in the industry as ''crypto winters,'' supporters encouraged their peers to invest more while prices were low, or ''buy the dip.'' But this time, analysts said, the message is not landing.\par \par \uc2 ''You have so much pessimism in the space,'' said \uc2 Ed Moya\uc2 , a crypto analyst at \uc2 OANDA\uc2 . ''There's no confidence right now to buy the dip.''\par \par \uc2 A Bitcoin A.T.M. at the Manhattan terminal of the Staten Island Ferry, a sign of its rising ubiquity.

\par\par \uc2 GUEST ESSAY\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Crypto's Crashes Won't Kill \uc2 Blockchain\b0\par\par\uc2 By Maria Bustillos \par \uc2 1,499 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This week, the crypto market plummeted for the second time in a month, in tandem with a sharp drop in global stock markets. The collapse, not the first of its kind, showed again how the violent swings of a largely unregulated market warp the development of a transformative technology. But crypto is just one aspect of the larger \uc2 blockchain\uc2  universe. Its skeptics and fans alike must learn to see it as a technological experiment, instead of just a blatant scam or a speculative path to riches.\par \par \uc2 Why has the market fallen apart in such spectacular fashion?\par \par \uc2 The first recent crash, when the cryptocurrency market plunged 36 percent in a week in May, offers a clue. The collapse was largely set off by the death spiral of a cryptocurrency system called Terra Luna, made up of the coin Luna and its associated stablecoin, TerraUSD. At its dizzying heights in the spring, it represented roughly 3 percent of the total crypto market. Fear spread throughout the exchanges, and with it came panic selling.\par \par \uc2 After the second crash this week, the cryptocurrency market is still worth in total nearly $1 trillion (about one-third of last November's peak). Only a few of the 19,000 cryptocurrencies that have been created since 2009 are now worth billions. Most have failed. The crypto market is wildly volatile not because of cryptocurrency's underlying technology, but because of the uneasy and often dangerously unstable junction between emerging technologies and regular money. Viewed from the long perspective of market history, this instability isn't remotely new.\par \par \uc2 In the late 1990s and early 2000s, internet stocks were a white-knuckle ride, just as crypto is now. Back then, too, hucksterism was rampant, the atmosphere was like a casino, and almost any idea with an ''e'' in front of it -- no matter how reckless or silly -- attracted attention from investors and the news media. Seemingly every day, fortunes were spectacularly made and lost.\par \par \uc2 But even as Napster, Webvan and eToys flamed out, a revolution was taking place. Despite all the shenanigans going on in the casino, real and lasting companies, publications and communities were built and thrived online. The internet survived, more or less.\par \par \uc2 Terraform Labs, the company behind TerraUSD and Luna, was founded in 2018 by Do Kwon, a computer scientist and entrepreneur in South Korea. Mr. Kwon, now 30, is a notoriously brazen hustler who has made waves for calling his critics ''poor'' and ''cockroaches.'' But despite his lack of polish, and the early warnings from developers and analysts about the technical weaknesses of his plans, he succeeded in raising $200 million in venture capital from 2018 to 2021. His company boasted of reaching an elusive goal in crypto, namely, the establishment of a truly ''decentralized'' stablecoin.\par \par \uc2 Stablecoins, which serve as a kind of bridge between crypto and ordinary money, have so far required vast amounts of old-fashioned real-world collateral to work, contrary to crypto's original aim of eliminating reliance on legacy financial systems. Terra Luna was an algorithmic stablecoin system in which ''stability'' was supposedly guaranteed by mathematical mechanisms and incentives. Like those highflying early internet stocks, these, too, proved vulnerable when trust failed.\par \par \uc2 In the 2000s, the alchemists of collateralized debt obligations turned junk securities into AAA gold through the mathematical magic of ''bundling.'' The arcane mathematics underpinning algorithmic stablecoin systems like Terra Luna gave off the same captivatingly mysterious vibe. But when more and more borrowers defaulted, collateral debt obligations and other exotic derivatives -- which Warren Buffett once called ''financial weapons of mass destruction'' -- collapsed, contributing to the 2008 global financial crisis. Echoes of the destructive power of derivatives can be heard in the story of the equally exotic Terra Luna.\par \par \uc2 Risk like this can go unperceived for only so long. The sad thing is that when risk suddenly becomes manifest, it takes real people's money and, often, good and promising projects down with it. Or even whole economies: Losses in the 2008 crash were estimated at more than $10 trillion in the United States alone -- a sum that dwarfs the most destructive swings in crypto so far.\par \par \uc2 As Terra Luna's death spiral accelerated, its supporters, known as ''Lunatics,'' lurched between terror and hope as Mr. Kwon shoveled more than $1 billion in Bitcoin into the system in an attempt to restore stability. ''Deploying more capital -- steady lads,'' he tweeted.\par \par \uc2 But ultimately, there wasn't enough cash coming in to make up for outflow, just as in an ordinary bank run, and this particular experiment in replacing trust with mathematics was at an end. Among the many thousands of failed crypto experiments, Terra Luna stands out as one of the largest, taking with it roughly $60 billion in total market value.\par \par \uc2 The vociferous opponents of crypto have been quick to celebrate the death of the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , insisting that all crypto is fraudulent. These critics are a mirror image of the equally unrealistic cheerleaders at the opposite end of the spectrum: the pro-crypto libertarians clamoring for a financial world with no regulations whatsoever.\par \par \uc2 Responsible players in the crypto market have been calling for and helping to develop sensible regulatory frameworks for many years. A bedrock of crypto regulations already exists; in the United States, federal agencies such as the \uc2 Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\uc2 , the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  and the \uc2 Commodity Futures Trading Commission\uc2  started weighing in on separate aspects of trade and taxation in 2013. In October, the Department of Justice announced the formation of the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team. The list of crypto scammers who have gone to jail already far surpasses the number of bankers jailed in the United States for their role in the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 In the early days of the internet, the circus atmosphere made it easy to ignore the dangers that were brewing -- surveillance capitalism and illegal government snooping among them -- and that would have grave global consequences. In time, regulations were put in place: privacy frameworks, like some provisions of the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in the United States and the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation in Europe, and speech protections like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.\par \par \uc2 At the same time, the marvels of the internet multiplied, magic that by now seems unremarkable: a map of the world, street by street, in your pocket; instant translations from almost any language; a look-up service for every branch of knowledge; global, near-instantaneous news. Today's internet is deeply woven into the world's economies, media, politics, industry and social life, in good ways and bad.\par \par \uc2 A similar evolution is in the works for crypto. \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 , the technology that makes cryptocurrency possible, has the potential to be just as transformative as the internet innovations on which we depend every day, and industries like supply chain management, finance and pharma have already begun to find uses for it.\par \par \uc2 It's possible to imagine a future where you might look up the fate of every tax dollar you've paid, and government corruption becomes all but impossible; where beautiful and important stories and music, games and art would never disappear from the internet; where, instead of being forced to rely on a big power company, you might buy and sell surplus solar energy from or to your own neighbors, and never face another blackout. Wherever tamper-proof, independent record-keeping is needed, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  could keep all the receipts, available and safe, for anyone to see.\par \par \uc2 But in order to make a world like that possible, crypto must be responsibly integrated into the existing global economy. Regulators, the media and market participants must get on the same page to balance the benefits of innovation against the need to prevent harm, and naked greed should be roundly chastised, not encouraged.\par \par \uc2 To many, the possibility of huge profits is the most interesting thing about crypto -- it's a gold rush in which anyone can suddenly become rich beyond his or her dreams. But the regrettable get-rich-quick mentality that has too long been associated with entrepreneurship, in crypto and elsewhere, must come to an end.\par \par \uc2 After all, just as most everyone keeps going to work whether the stock market is soaring or tanking, the practical, real-world work of developing \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology will keep on going, independent of the histrionics of the market.\par \par \uc2 Maria Bustillos (@mariabustillos) is a founding editor of the Brick House Cooperative, a journalist-owned publishing platform, and Popula, an alternative news and culture magazine.

\par\par \uc2 YOUR MONEY\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 How to See E.S.G. Funds As Stocks Fall\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ron Lieber \par \uc2 1,736 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk trashed E.S.G. investing. The S.E.C. is investigating \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 's move into the sector. In a falling market, what should investors consider?\par \par \uc2 Any time the stock market falls, investors are likely to rethink nearly everything.\par \par \uc2 The current gut check comes at a point in the evolution of the investing industry when assets in so-called E.S.G. funds have risen 38 percent in the past year, to $2.7 trillion by the end of March, according to Morningstar Direct. Professionals overlay all manner of rules and screens for the investments they pick, using climate, diversity or other data to construct what are now over 6,000 funds worldwide.\par \par \uc2 There is a cost for consciousness: The funds often have high fees that can reduce returns if the investments don't do better than whatever alternatives you reject. And there's a fair bit of confusion about what the term E.S.G. -- short for environmental, social and governance -- means in practice.\par \par \uc2 That can lead to episodes like one last month when \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  called the entire industry a ''scam,'' after S&P Global had the temerity to remove \uc2 Tesla\uc2  from an E.S.G. index. S&P did this, it said, in part because of accusations of racial discrimination and other worker mistreatment.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  is frantically trying to catch up, investigating \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and other big banks and questioning whether some are slapping E.S.G. labels on funds that may not deserve them to make a grab for investor assets.\par \par \uc2 To try to help everyday investors make sense of this, I turned to two professionals who have spent a fair bit of time vetting wannabe E.S.G. investments.\par \par \uc2 The first is \uc2 Amy Domini\uc2 , 72, the founder and chair of Domini Impact Investments and a pioneer in the E.S.G. field. The second is Rachel Robasciotti, 43, the founder and chief executive of Adasina Social Capital, which describes itself as an ''investment and financial activism'' firm.\par \par \uc2 Here's what they had to say.\par \par \uc2 RON LIEBER: What's the most accurate definition of E.S.G. today, and how has it changed?\par \par \uc2 AMY DOMINI: Before we start, is that the preferred vocabulary? When I got started it was ''ethical investing,'' but I've lost so many vocabulary fights in my life.\par \par \uc2 I view it as providing a more robust set of material data points from which an investment adviser can make a decision.\par \par \uc2 And I view it as fulfillment of a fiduciary obligation. Assets aren't being managed to the greatest interest of beneficiaries if, in fact, they can't breathe or life is too dangerous at the end of their wealth building. So I see it as a means to an end, and that end is a planet that is livable -- and lives worth living. And I see it as a strategy that explicitly acknowledges that investors have a role to play in providing these outcomes to the world.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: Rachel, you were familiar with Amy's funds. Did you come to a different conclusion?\par \par \uc2 RACHEL ROBASCIOTTI: We call our work ''social justice investing.'' It's the deep integration of four areas: racial, gender, economic and climate justice.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: Defining justice seems messy these days. On one hand, some investors don't want to invest in weapons manufacturers. On the other, many of them would very much like to put more weapons in the hands of the Ukrainians.\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: In the world our investors want to live in, the government is responsible for weapons and defense, and that is not a private activity.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: Wait, so the government should be producing weapons?\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: Capitalism is great at distributing goods and services broadly and cheaply. Weapons shouldn't be distributed broadly and cheaply.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: Academics have been talking for years about how so-called active investing is a bad idea -- that it's just too hard to actively select the stocks that will do better than others over the long haul. Doesn't E.S.G. investing violate these principles?\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: In order to do a good job of social justice investing, you have to be active on those issues and pay attention when a company's behavior shifts in a way that has a real, material impact on its future.\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: Take Square. They had an arguably strong story for empowering small-business owners, a strong economic justice theme that you could get excited about. As they became more and more of a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company -- to the point where they changed their name, that initial exciting thesis became less and less present.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: Maybe it's better for curious investors to play with the word ''active'' then, and think of E.S.G. as activist investing. If someone is going to pay the higher-than-average fees -- or at least the higher-than-basic-index-funds fees that firms like yours charge -- it shouldn't just be to move money around silently from one public company to another in a way that may not have much impact. Activists bring pressure. They make noise.\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: We wrote 150 companies in Japan, pointing out that there were two genders and their boards didn't reflect that fact. Japan doesn't have robust shareholder resolution opportunities, but that doesn't mean you can't have some activism.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: We're in a bear market now. That's often a time when people look to cut costs in their investment portfolios. There's a long history of hand-wringing in the investment industry about the fact that your funds are not cheap. Do you lose in these kinds of market conditions?\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: You have E.S.G. products now at \uc2 Vanguard\uc2 , \uc2 Fidelity\uc2 , TIAA. They're all doing it because it adds value to the investment decision-making process. That doesn't go away. It's here to stay.\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: Historically, women, people of color -- particularly Black people like myself -- weren't allowed into the industry. And now that we're starting to emerge, we're in a situation where we have this enormous price pressure. ''Bring your fees down!''\par \par \uc2 Organizing, mobilizing, educating other investors, putting together data sets -- all of that takes people. You have to be able to invest in them.\par \par \uc2 So I would really question if someone is delivering impact at a really low price point. Many, many, many times with cheap E.S.G., you could hit a data wall and stop. And what we've done is break down the data wall.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: OK, but do you always trust the data that you get from companies themselves -- the raw numbers or the way they might be selectively counting things?\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: We use less of the data that companies provide on their own. Data gathered independently by third parties who are verifying it with public companies' practices is what we really lean on.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  would beg to differ on the value that E.S.G. adds. How would you try to persuade him in 100 words or less?\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI (chuckling): Here's what I'd say: The reason that you're confused is because you're a single-issue C.E.O., and that's not the way of the future. The way of the future is people and planet, and a fractured society can't make anything, including electric cars.\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: He went after my industry instead of going after the index that excluded him. The whole industry didn't throw him out.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: Individual investors face scores of E.S.G. choices. \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and others hope that familiar names will matter. What's the correct framing question that individuals should ask when fund shopping?\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: There's actually three. The first is, what are your issues? To us, those are racial, gender, economic and climate, because those are the places where capitalism extracts value unsustainably.\par \par \uc2 Then, how are you measuring it? And the most important question, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is who decides what matters? Go to the people who are most impacted and ask them what is significant, because they're closest to the problem and often farthest from the power. And that's information that investors are not currently getting.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: What's the most nonobvious example of this third one?\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: When we went to the Poor People's Campaign and asked what we should be focusing on, they led us to working with One Fair Wage, which is working to eliminate subminimum wages for tip workers.\par \par \uc2 We created a whole ''Investors for Livable Wages'' campaign and had a collective investor statement that represented over half a trillion dollars of investor money, via the signers, making the case for all public companies ending subminimum wages.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: This all feels like a lot of work for the investor. Where's my interactive tool that allows just one of the many funds to fall out as my best choice?\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: I feel that a step is better than not taking a step. I'm not totally hung up on who does a better analysis, or an analysis that is consistent with my own analysis. I've looked at so-called strict portfolios that have stocks that I wouldn't put in my portfolio.\par \par \uc2 LIEBER: So this analysis paralysis is my problem -- this isn't the industry's problem?\par \par \uc2 DOMINI: I like women-owned firms, if you want to start with something!\par \par \uc2 ROBASCIOTTI: Just 1.4 percent of all assets at U.S.-based firms are managed by firms owned by women or people of color. So you can narrow your universe right there.\par \par \uc2 The reason why that matters is that doing it the way we've always done it has given us the world we have now. If we're going to have a different world -- if we are going to invest in making more of what we actually want -- we're going to have to choose a different set of people who haven't yet been at the table.\par \par \uc2 Rachel Robasciotti, founder and C.E.O. of Adasina Social Capital.

\par\par \uc2 FARHAD MANJOO\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Crypto, Houses, Sneakers, Rolexes: How FOMO Drove the Economy\b0\par\par\uc2 By Farhad Manjoo \par \uc2 1,068 \uc2 words\par \uc2 18 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 18\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The lowest-priced, stainless-steel version of the Cosmograph Daytona, the Rolex model that Paul Newman made famous, carries a suggested retail price of $14,550. But you're unlikely to snag one so cheap.\par \par \uc2 Demand for luxury mechanical wristwatches has far outstripped supply in the last few years, and the waiting list for the most popular Rolex models -- if you can first convince an authorized dealer that you are worthy of one -- is now said to be several years long. According to WatchCharts, a price database for watch collectors, a current-model Daytona sells for more than $40,000 on the secondary market; over the last five years, the Daytona's aftermarket price has grown by an average of 20 percent annually, making it a better investment than the S&P 500 over the same period.\par \par \uc2 It's not just prices for high-end watches that soared during the pandemic. For a wide range of collectible goods -- among them fine art, classic cars, luxury handbags, sneakers, comic books and trading cards -- the last few years were bubblier than a bottle of Dom P\u233\'00\'E9rignon (whose prices for certain vintages have also shot up). Then there's the market for houses, an admittedly more practical scarce good, where prices also rose to intolerable new heights in recent years.\par \par \uc2 I've been thinking about these asset bubbles a lot lately, especially as I've been following the crash of Bitcoin, Ethereum, NFTs and the larger cryptocurrency industry that grew so hot during the pandemic. Proponents of DeFi -- crypto jargon for ''decentralized finance,'' which essentially seeks to replicate the financial-services industry with crypto-based systems -- argue that the technology will expand access to financial products and unleash a wave of innovation now hampered by the overlords of traditional finance, what they derisively call TradFi.\par \par \uc2 But it's fast becoming clear that crypto was just another collectible pumped up by the same forces inflating the market for Yeezys and Birkin bags -- a lot of money sloshing around the world, not a lot of obvious places to put it, and a fear of missing out on something that everyone else seemed to think would be hot.\par \par \uc2 Just as a Rolex does not tell time any better than a regular wristwatch -- in fact, electronic watches are far more accurate than mechanical ones -- DeFi seems to do nothing better than TradFi, and in a lot of practical ways it's worse. As a group of computer scientists and other tech experts wrote in an open letter to Congress recently: ''By its very design, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology is poorly suited for just about every purpose currently touted as a present or potential source of public benefit.''\par \par \uc2 So why did so many invest? Because FOMO is a hell of a drug. Because when prices are shooting up and you feel the fear of missing out, you can talk yourself into imagining intrinsic value in anything: A mechanical wristwatch is a marvel of miniature engineering, almost a piece of art in its intricate complexity. Or: An algorithmic stablecoin is a marvel of fintech engineering, a way of replicating old-fashioned banks and payment networks on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  to create an open financial infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Wait, what? No, I don't know what that means either -- but look how cool it is! And, more important, look how cool other people think it is!\par \par \uc2 The wrinkle in my analogy, of course, is that the sort of hotshot who can drop 40 grand on a Rollie probably isn't going to feel much of a hit if Daytonas suddenly become uncool. (In fact, resale prices of Rolexes and other luxury wristwatches have been falling in the last couple of months. The sneaker resale market is also softening.)\par \par \uc2 Crypto, on the other hand, was pitched to everyone, rich and poor. On social media, on financial TV networks and on celeb-studded Super Bowl ads, these complex, volatile, crash-prone, unregulated financial products were sold to the masses as can't-miss opportunities. ''Fortune favors the brave,'' Matt Damon promised, while Larry David starred in an ad whose tagline invoked FOMO explicitly: ''Don't miss out on crypto.''\par \par \uc2 Crypto was also just the latest in a string of unsustainable asset bubbles that have rocked American life over the last two decades. At the turn of the century people were trying to make it big investing in money-losing dot-coms. The mid- to late 2000s was dominated by the housing boom that led to the Great Recession. And since 2010, we've had a series of boom-and-bust cycles in crypto -- before this latest run-up, Bitcoin rose and fell in 2011, then from 2013 to 2015, and then again from 2017 to 2018.\par \par \uc2 I've seen much schadenfreude online recently -- lots of people who sat out the crypto boom mocking those who went all in, which is perhaps only fair after years of crypto bros telling skeptics to ''have fun staying poor.''\par \par \uc2 But can you blame them? Surveys suggest that people under 40 have been much more willing than older people to put their money into crypto. This makes sense when you consider that much of their adult lives have been dominated by these boom-bust cycles and persistently low growth in real wages.\par \par \uc2 For millions of people, crypto, like real estate and dot-coms before it, offered a way out of what has otherwise been a dead-end economy. They were simply trying to get ahead in just about the only way one can these days: Put your money into something hot and hope it goes big. It's the American way.\par \par \uc2 Office Hours With Farhad Manjoo\par \par \uc2 Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone .

But some critics question whether the new tools present a true opportunity or a threat.\par \par \uc2 ''Predatory inclusion'' is the concept of increased access to products or services -- only on exploitative or dangerous terms that in fact undermine the potential benefits. The phrase has been applied to housing and education loans targeting minorities. Increasingly, it also comes up in discussions of crypto, said the veteran tech journalist and New York Times Opinion podcaster Kara Swisher at a task force on the future of money at the DealBook D.C. policy forum last week.\par \par \uc2 ''There's been a really growing anti-crypto movement among a lot of really old-school internet people,'' Ms. Swisher said. Noting that the crypto space is rife with scams, she added that predatory inclusion ''is actually real.''\par \par \uc2 But Cleve Mesidor, a Black woman who leads the nonprofit \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Foundation, challenged the notion ''that we're now being fooled in some way.'' She says she believes that the concerns about predation are premised on a false assumption.\par \par \uc2 ''The reality is that Black and Latino innovators and investors lead adoption in the space. We've been doing that over the last five to eight years, and we've been doing that by educating our communities,'' Ms. Mesidor said. ''The biggest risk to my community, my contemporaries, has been traditional finance.''\par \par \uc2 That history of predation cannot be ignored, agreed Alondra Nelson, who leads the \uc2 White House's Office of Science and Technology Policy\uc2 . But Ms. Nelson, a Black woman, suggested that crypto might be no different. She has the same concerns about conflicts of interest and misaligned incentives in crypto as apply in traditional finance, but there are fewer regulations to constrain the new industry's players.\par \par \uc2 ''That's going to take advantage of those who can least withstand the losses or take on that risk,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Many crypto companies operate in regulatory gray spaces, where investors have few of the protections that exist for other financial products. And crypto is volatile -- Bitcoin has fallen from a high of about $68,000 in November to about $22,000 this week, and the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies fell to below $1 trillion from a high of about three times as much last year.\par \par \uc2 The uncertainty and price swings suggest to the \uc2 Cornell University\uc2  economics professor \uc2 Eswar Prasad\uc2 , author of the 2021 book ''The Future of Money,'' that cryptocurrencies are purely speculative assets and probably not a path to total global economic salvation.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Prasad says he sees ''the real promise of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology,'' which allows for more access and transparency, but fears that the new industry will indeed repeat old patterns. ''At this moment, we have this fantastic technology, which could lead us to a more glorious world. But there is a great risk of subversion.''\par \par \uc2 Participants: Caroline Crenshaw, commissioner, \uc2 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 ; Alondra Nelson, deputy assistant to the president, head of the \uc2 Office of Science and Technology Policy\uc2 ; Kara Calvert, head of U.S. policy, \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 ; Kristin Smith, executive director, \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Association; \uc2 Jonathan Levin\uc2 , co-founder, \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 ; \uc2 Eswar Prasad\uc2 , economics professor, \uc2 Cornell University\uc2 ; Michele Korver, head of regulatory, crypto, \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 ; Cleve Mesidor, executive director, \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Foundation; and Lindsey Parker, chief technology officer, Washington, D.C.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY VALERIE PLESCH FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220615ei6f0005g\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

It was around when his small-time Bitcoin-cash exchange business blew up and he was handling millions of dollars, and the whole thing turned into what federal prosecutors called a money-laundering operation.\par \par \uc2 It all started so innocently. Back when Bitcoin was new, there were people who wanted to flip Bitcoin for dollars and others who needed dollars for Bitcoin. In these early days of cryptocurrency, going from dollars to Bitcoin or vice versa wasn't as easy as it is now, but Mejia figured out how to make it simple enough. He became a ''human A.T.M.,'' balancing a trade of Bitcoin with a trade of dollars and charging a little vig each way. ''I'd make 150 bucks for the day,'' he said. ''And that was my day. That was my hustle.''\par \par \uc2 Word got around, and Mejia got new customers -- some of whom wanted to change quite a bit more money than he was accustomed to. ''Now, I'm not a stupid person,'' he told me. ''I knew these individuals weren't involved in the horse and concession trade like they said. This was getting out of control, and I was in too deep.'' He was putting 2,000 miles a week on his car, picking up suitcases filled with as much as $150,000, even $250,000, in cash, which he would have to take home until he could work out the Bitcoin flip. He asked me: ''So if you had that kind of money, Jack -- for example, if I may, under your bed -- could you sleep comfortably, really?''\par \par \uc2 Suddenly, he was demanding a lot more from his Xanax. ''It went from nervousness and stress to fear and depression,'' he said, all of which found creative ways to express itself. One day he woke up to find his eyes were bleeding from the inside. Mejia was diagnosed with retinopathy and began getting regular injections into his eyeballs to save his sight.\par \par \uc2 Then, one very early morning last winter, it all fell apart. Some 25 federal agents from a joint Homeland Security and I.R.S. task force stormed his house in Ontario, Calif. ''They pounced on my home like I was El Chapo,'' he said. His aunt and mother were handcuffed, and Mejia was detained in his den by agents who grilled him for hours.\par \par \uc2 Mejia, a \uc2 U.S. Army\uc2  veteran and former schoolteacher, insists he had never messed up like this before. He always thought of himself as a hardworking, regular guy. Mejia is good-looking in a middle-aged Vin Diesel sort of way. He certainly didn't recognize himself in the Department of Justice news release that was issued shortly after his arrest, painting him as an international financial mastermind facing as much as 25 years in federal prison.\par \par \uc2 He also couldn't get a straight answer about anything. He hadn't even been formally arrested yet; he was a ''target'' in a much bigger investigation. The federal authorities really wanted the identity of a certain guy whose money Mejia handled, but Mejia says he never met this person. He quickly suggested a proffer, a deal, but the feds wanted to know more about his client; Mejia insisted he didn't know any more and found himself in an impossible situation. If he didn't tell them something, he was facing serious time.\par \par \uc2 Of course, he hired a lawyer -- one who described himself as a cryptocurrency expert. But soon, Mejia discovered that their expensive sessions mostly involved Mejia's tutoring his own attorney in the complexities of the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . He was already going to plead out and sensed that he was in the grip of an inescapable process, so he fired that lawyer (and the next one) and wound up being represented by a court-appointed attorney.\par \par \uc2 In the meantime, he started scouring the internet madly, to see what he could learn about his future. ''I would scare myself watching videos of jail,'' he said. Mejia had entered one of the Kubler-Rossian periods of the prison-bound, self-terrorism. But then Mejia stumbled on a video of a guy named Justin Paperny, himself a former financial criminal, who was all over \uc2 YouTube\uc2  dispensing ''so you're going to prison'' advice in a confident peppy patter, answering questions newly charged defendants might not even think to ask. Mejia loved this guy and spent hours watching his videos. ''It would kind of calm my anxiety,'' he said. The big fears started to seem less terrifying. He learned that he would most likely be going to a low-security prison, where ''violence is not even common, let alone rape or anything like that.''\par \par \uc2 Justin Paperny leads White Collar Advice, a firm of 12 convicted felons, each with their own consulting specialty based on where they served time and their own sentencing experiences. After a deep dive into Paperny's \uc2 YouTube\uc2  lessons, Mejia knew he had to hire him. This was 21st-century America, and this was precisely what he needed: a prison consultant.\par \par \uc2 Maybe you've heard of these consultants recently. After a prominent felon is sentenced, a spate of stories often appear about these backstage fixers for the wealthy, consultants who can help get a client into prisons that one might prefer -- say, a prison that has superior schooling or CrossFit-level gyms or lenient furlough policies or better-paying jobs or other refined specialties. The federal prison in Otisville, N.Y., for example, is also known as ''federal Jewish heaven'' because of its good kosher food (decent gefilte fish, they say, and the rugelach's not bad). When those Varsity Blues parents were busted for paying backdoor operatives to engineer their kids' college admissions, it was also reported that many hired prison consultants to game out the aftermath.\par \par \uc2 Paperny's business is a natural market outgrowth of a continuing and profound shift in America's judicial system. Almost everyone facing charges is forced to plead guilty (or face an angry prosecutor who will take you to trial). In 2021, 98.3 percent of federal cases ended up as plea bargains. It's arguable that in our era of procedural dramas and endless ''Law & Order'' reruns, speedy and public trials are more common on television than in real-life courthouses. What people like Mejia have to deal with as they await sentencing is a lot of logistics.\par \par \uc2 The idea of a prison consultant might conjure an image of an insider broker or fixer, but they're really more like an SAT tutor -- someone who understands test logic and the nuances of unwritten rules. Yet prison consulting also involves dealing with a desolate human being who has lost almost everything -- friends, family, money, reputation -- and done it in such a way that no one gives a damn. So they're also a paid-for best friend, plying their clients with Tony Robbins-style motivational insights, occasionally mixed with powerful sessions about the nature of guilt and shame.\par \par \uc2 On television, the journey to prison is nearly instantaneous: a jump cut to a slamming cell door. But in the real world, it's a set of steps, routine bureaucratic actions that involve interviews, numerous forms to complete and dates with officials. A lawyer is your legal guide to staying out of prison, but once that becomes inevitable, a prison consultant is there to chaperone you through the bureaucracies that will eventually land you in your new home, easing your entry into incarceration -- and sometimes even returning you to the outside, utterly changed.\par \par \uc2 When I first started talking to Mejia and sitting in on his consultations, about a year ago, there was rarely a meeting when he wouldn't slip in some version of the story of his crime. Mostly he tried to emphasize that he wasn't as guilty as his plea made him out to be, that he wasn't really, deep down, a criminal at all. He would tell it over and over again; it would pop up in almost any conversation, often wedged into a conversation after a ''for the record'' or ''I just want to say'' or ''Jack, you might be interested to know.''\par \par \uc2 The tone and the desperation of that repeated story -- I was in over my head; I'm not a bad guy -- always had a kind of curdling effect on the listener. It was tiresome, but also, on some level, it felt familiar. In much less calamitous circumstances, we've all vamped our way through some variation of it. It's every culprit's first draft of his own story, because it's human nature; it's irresistible. In ''The Shawshank Redemption,'' when Tim Robbins first insists that he did nothing wrong, Morgan Freeman beams. ''Hell, you'll fit right in, then,'' he says. ''Everyone's innocent in here.''\par \par \uc2 One of the first things Paperny advises a client like Mejia to do is to stop doing that, especially before sentencing. You pleaded guilty already. You did it. Own it -- because the vamping will almost certainly annoy any judge or civil servant who hears it, and you'll wind up with a much longer sentence. That's arguably the most crucial piece of advice that Paperny provides to his clients, for the simple reason that when you're going to prison, you have to formally tell your story to all kinds of people.\par \par \uc2 The storytelling officially begins a few weeks after a guilty plea (or a conviction by trial) in a sit-down interview with a law-enforcement officer whose specialty is writing up a pre-sentencing report, which will be given to the presiding judge. The descriptions of the crime come largely from the plea agreement, which is, naturally, centered on the proposition that you are a heinous criminal and a moral fugitive. Think of a Wikipedia biography that tells the story of the worst moment of your life, with everything else about you salted away in footnotes. This is what the sentencing judge will read before deciding precisely how long you will be confined -- and it's a story that will follow you throughout your stay with the state.\par \par \uc2 ''They call the pre-sentencing report the Bible in prison, because it is one of the first things a case manager or counselor will rely upon,'' Paperny said. ''It will influence early release, your half-house time, your bunk, your job and so on.'' And the person writing that story for you is someone who's already heard every version of the breathy, stem-winding explanation imaginable. ''They're used to us saying, 'We're sorry because we got caught,''' Paperny said during one of his meetings with Mejia. ''Or, 'We paid back the money because we don't want to go to jail,' or, 'We cooperated to avoid prison.'''\par \par \uc2 Many lawyers send their clients into this interview with the standard legal advice to say as little as possible and limit the damage -- good advice during an arrest or even in the courtroom. ''But this is the most important interview the defendant will ever have, and you'd be stunned at how many defendants do not prepare,'' Paperny said. ''This is a chance for you to change the narrative.'' At the moment Mejia says hello to the interviewer, all the material the officer has on the table is focused on the crime. And if Mejia surrenders to the mighty tug of self-exoneration, then the focus of the story remains the legal transgression and the biography instantly turns into a profile of a career criminal.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Paperny and his colleagues coax a full biography out of each client. They encourage you to write out a full life story in the form of a letter, then rewrite it with editors working through every line, then ask you to read it over and over until, eventually, you sit down for a mock interview. By the time the officer is conducting the real interview, the story he hears is a full autobiography with a beginning, a middle and an end. And somewhere in there is this speed bump in the narrative -- your crime.\par \par \uc2 During these early sessions, a client will often spend time with Brad Rouse, who is the firm's expert in written narrative. In his previous career, Rouse was a well-known theater director in New York, a Harvard graduate whose credits include the 2012 musical about Andy Warhol, ''Pop!'' and Billy Porter's 2005 one-man show, ''Ghetto Superstar.'' His 2001 revival of the Harold Arlen musical ''Bloomer Girl'' earned him a segment on \uc2 CBS\uc2 's ''60 Minutes II.'' But those aren't his real credentials. Like everyone on Paperny's consulting team, Rouse has served time in federal lockup. About 15 years ago, he fell heavily into drug use and ended up dealing ''five, six, seven types of drugs'' -- until some 10 agents burst into his West Village apartment.\par \par \uc2 Often, when clients first encounter Rouse, they are in that post-plea misery marked by social paralysis, thousand-yard stares and near catatonia. It's a delicate time. Suicide is a real risk. ''I remember when I piled furniture up in front of my window, because I'm on the sixth floor,'' he said. ''I had such a desire to kill myself.'' Many of the people he talks to have basically been law-abiding high achievers who justified crossing some line for the first time, lost everything and were staring into a near future of incarceration. ''They feel like they've dropped through the dance floor and it's over,'' he told me. That's where the conversation often starts -- scattered details, eventually gathered into coherence. ''It's like directing a one-man show,'' he said, except the audience is also one person, the judge.\par \par \uc2 Throughout the spring, Mejia was kicking drafts of the letter back and forth with Rouse and Paperny, and I read them as they became more and more refined. Mejia's pre-sentencing interview was scheduled in June, and by early summer, a different character began to come into focus -- a 15-year-old striver who rode a bus for an hour to work as a liquor-store stock boy and who once won a competition with his ''King Lear'' monologue, who then left home to become a reconnaissance specialist in the Army before returning to Los Angeles for college and eventually a master's in business administration. Mejia's story (which is about half as long as this article) has a Hallmark TV-movie quality to it. But the result is intriguing, almost like one of those standout obituaries, only the subject is still alive.\par \par \uc2 One unexpected feature of these narratives is how much of the story hints at a rehabilitation that has yet to fully manifest. More than a few felons awaiting sentencing told me that they were already paying back their victims. Many just get jobs -- one former C.E.O. I spoke with was working for minimum wage -- while others have started entire businesses and kept them operating straight through a lengthy prison term. Part of the reason Paperny pushes his clients to get back to work, any work, is to provide some good, upright-citizen material for the pre-sentencing report, but also to break out of the paralysis that Rouse describes. After Paperny got caught, he remembers letting whole days and weeks go by, ordering two double cheeseburgers, two fries and a shake from In-N-Out while compulsively playing online chess, until the onetime trim U.S.C. college baseball player staggered around his house topping 200 pounds.\par \par \uc2 If you've ever listened to a podcast, maybe you've heard an ad for MeUndies. The company was started by a man named Jonathan Shokrian, just before he was sentenced to a short prison term in 2014. He hired Paperny on his way in and ran the company from prison, later expanding it after meeting a bank robber named Grease who, it turns out, was a marketing savant (look it up; worth the read). So by the time Mejia was prepping for his pre-sentencing interview, he had already set up several new enterprises, one of them an online store that sells Rolexes, which can be paid for with crypto (watchhodler.com).\par \par \uc2 But how the letter handles the present tense is the most vivid transformation. All the self-exoneration has been slyly edited out. The first-person confessional tone is searing. ''I write this letter feeling humiliated and heartbroken,'' Mejia begins. ''I know now that I crossed a red line that exists for important reasons. At first, exchanging cash for Bitcoin seemed legitimate. I see now that I was wrong.'' He closes by addressing the judge directly: ''It was important for me to show you who I really am. I accept full responsibility for my action and will never return to your courtroom as a criminal defendant.''\par \par \uc2 The tenor here feels pious, as though somehow the whole process has reverted to the religious origins of incarceration. Guilt, confession, penitence -- this legacy vocabulary of criminal justice calls back to a time when confinement was about reform and salvation, before modern punishment turned exclusively on physical torture, the amateur savagery of shower-rape jokes, random beat-downs, the cruelty of solitary. But put all the parts together, and the buoyant takeaway for any judge reading it is that maybe his job is already done. Nothing isolates one's crime, and all the moral dereliction that comes with it, quite like a story in which the jail time, which hasn't even started, already seems to be receding into the past.\par \par \uc2 When the rapper Stat Quo was busted on charges of participating in a scheme to steal millions of frequent-flier miles, naturally he hired a lawyer, but still he was freaking out. ''So I went on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 . And I was just looking up, you know, 'What do you do when you have been named in an indictment?''' Stat Quo, legally Stanley Benton, came across the same videos Mejia found and started, in his words, ''binge watching.'' Every topic that was haunting him -- what to do when you're actually indicted, picking a lawyer, preparing a sentencing memorandum -- each had its own video, narrated with Paperny's trademark confidence. ''OK,'' Stat Quo remembers thinking, ''this guy knows what he's talking about.'' So he hired him.\par \par \uc2 On the morning I caught up with Stat Quo, he had just gotten back from a Pasadena kitchen where he was cooking breakfast for the homeless three mornings a week. He started doing it years ago, long before he got in trouble, and stayed with it. ''Actually, it's important for me to see that, you know what I mean? Because you know this Hollywood stuff that I'm in -- you will lose sight of reality sometimes, you know. My friends' houses look like malls.''\par \par \uc2 His full story was pitch perfect. He'd never tangled with the law before, and he has a family. Still, he had the usual long-winded take on his own innocence (his friend had offered him discounted airline tickets, and he bought them without knowing that this friend had gotten them by hacking into other people's accounts and stealing their miles). But when Stat Quo sat down to work on his narrative, he totally got it. He knew that anyone walking into a pre-sentencing interview is presumed to be a hardened criminal, but a Black rapper?\par \par \uc2 ''My case was out of Dallas, Texas. And let's be honest here,'' he said, ''not the most progressive state for a Black man. And listen, I'm not Drake black. I'm, like, Shaka Zulu black. You know what I'm saying?'' Three of the other defendants who used these stolen miles got real time. ''One guy got up there trying to explain all kinds of [expletive] and making excuses. That's the wrong thing to do. But he didn't have anyone to tell him, because that's just your natural instinct when you get in front of somebody. 'Judge, wait a minute, man. I ain't do nothing. Come on now. Hold on, man. You know, I'm just out here' -- slam.'' That guy was sentenced to two and a half years.\par \par \uc2 ''My judge saw me differently,'' he said. ''She's like, 'Based on what I've read about you, you shouldn't even be in here.''' In the sentencing hearing, Judge Jane Boyle said aloud, ''I wonder if he even should have been prosecuted.'' Then she said, ''I'd like to give you six months probation, but I can't.'' Then she turned to a court officer for clarification. ''Do I have to give him,'' she asked, ''a year probation?'' Informed that the guidelines required at least one year of probation, she imposed exactly that. ''That's because she was able to read my story,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Much of Paperny's advice comes from his own attempts to avoid prison when the Ponzi scheme he enabled collapsed. After being nabbed, he figured he would outsmart the feds with a series of artful dodges and deceptions. In the midst of constructing this web of lies, Paperny insisted that he take a lie-detector test. ''I immediately Googled for information on polygraph examinations,'' Paperny writes in his self-published confessional, ''Lessons From Prison.'' He found a $350 online course, which taught him all the ''ostensibly proven techniques'' to evade the lie detector. ''By tightening my sphincter when answering questions,'' he wrote, ''I supposedly could manipulate the machine's findings of truth to suit my purpose.'' And yet even though he ''practiced so fervently'' and then ''squeezed my innards when appropriate,'' the polygraph administrator informed him afterward that ''the machine indicated with an accuracy measurement of better than 99.99 percent'' that he was lying.\par \par \uc2 ''Justin,'' he added, ''you're going to prison.''\par \par \uc2 Once that reality set in, Paperny prepared the same way everyone does, and how his clients still do -- Googling ''what happens when you go to prison?'' He learned a jumble of information, but then the day came. Paperny reported to the Taft federal prison camp in California, changing his street clothes for a prison outfit. He quickly discovered that there are lots of rules in prison that \uc2 Quora\uc2  doesn't have the answers to, and routines you have to discover by yourself.\par \par \uc2 Soon enough, he met people and was told about people. There was a guy known as Dopey, another known as Road Runner. He heard about a mysterious figure named the Kingpin, who had served the longest and hardest time. And then there was Drew, the hustler on his floor who lured Paperny into accepting a contraband mattress, a dangerous first step because getting caught by the guards doing anything shady can easily win you an extended sentence. It was all dizzying, so Paperny decided to lie low and do what most inmates do -- exercise and try to stay out of trouble.\par \par \uc2 After a few days, the Kingpin was in the TV room and introduced himself. His name was Michael Santos, and he was busted for dealing in 1987, at the height of President \uc2 Ronald Reagan\uc2 's war on drugs. For a first offense, at age 23, Santos was sent to federal prison for 45 years. Whatever Paperny might have been expecting -- a battle-scarred lifer, a guy who could turn a Bic pen into a shiv -- Santos wasn't it. Instead, he was a self-educated man whose years of reading transformed him into something far beyond your typical jailhouse lawyer -- more of a jailhouse philosopher, concerned with the metaphysics of confinement.\par \par \uc2 Santos wanted to know if Paperny had ever read ''The Divine Comedy.'' ''In Dante's epic poem,'' he said, ''Virgil offered Dante a way out of the forest.'' Santos encouraged him not to worry so much about the softball league or the card games or all the other time-wasters available to prisoners who instinctively believe that their years behind bars are meant to be useless. He encouraged Paperny to read Aristotle and to ''know thyself.'' He told him he should really read Sun Tzu, too, and learn to ''know thy enemy.''\par \par \uc2 Like any sane convict, Paperny thought: You're kidding me. That's the wisdom of the centuries? Are you serious? Paperny wondered what the point was of all this \uc2 Reader's Digest\uc2  philosophy, but he found the books interesting. Who, he wondered, was his ''enemy''? Maybe, Santos told Paperny, the enemy is not a who. ''Maybe it's a what,'' he said. ''Maybe it's a prison term. Maybe it's an unfulfilling career that leads you to misery, or to bad decisions that land you in prison.''\par \par \uc2 At the time, Paperny was dealing with a lot of practical prison problems. He was working in the kitchen, under the thumb of an aggressive inmate who trafficked liberally in Holocaust denial. And then there was Santos, slowly teaching him to look past the office politics of prison and try to see his confinement as a bounty, a gift of years to prepare for what comes next. Think of prison as a business-planning session, Santos told him -- he'd been thinking that way for years. He'd already written several books, about getting through prison. Paperny was due to get out a lot earlier than he was, Santos pointed out, so maybe he could get a jump on the obvious business idea -- advising incoming felons on how best to handle a future of prison. When Paperny got out in 2009, he founded the business, with \uc2 Santos\uc2  joining on his release four years later.\par \par \uc2 Today, Paperny and \uc2 Santos\uc2  are business partners, co-founders of White Collar Advice and another business called Prison Professors, which is \uc2 Santos\uc2 's attempt to make their services and philosophy available to anyone, not just the white-collar felons who can afford their fees. (Paperny told me those fees range from a few thousand dollars into the six figures.) \uc2 Santos\uc2 's intention, long before he got out, was always much bigger than consulting with white-collar criminals, whom he described as merely the ''consumer side'' of the business.\par \par \uc2 ''It's way more important to me to help the million people that are in prison who keep recidivating,'' he said. To that end, the other side of the business seeks to recreate for thousands of prisoners a certain encounter Paperny had not long after meeting Santos. ''When I went in, I was a fat, miserable, self-loathing white-collar defendant blaming everyone but myself,'' Paperny said, ''and adjusted to prison like you do, complaining and exercising seven, eight hours a day.'' Then the Taft prison camp philosopher sidled up to him at the gym one day. ''And Santos said to me, kind of joking, like, 'Hey, bud, how much are people going to pay you to do those pull-ups when you get out?' And I'm like, 'Nobody.' And it was an aha moment.'' Santos believes that inmates should think of confinement not as punishment but as a continuing education for a future newly conceived.\par \par \uc2 ''Our team,'' Paperny said, ''is a big proponent for avoiding recreational sports in prison, like softball, because unless you're going to be a softball player when you come home, then I don't think you should play softball four days a week -- so, every choice should relate to the life you want to live when you come home.''\par \par \uc2 When Santos did get out in 2013, he had to get familiar with a few new technologies -- email, \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , basically the entire internet -- but has since crafted a series of videos into a kind of freshman course on how to navigate prison. They are now available in all the prisons of Washington State and California, sometimes with the lure of sentence reduction for inmates who complete them. A former warden who knew Santos has helped install them in the parts of the federal prison system. There are courses on setting goals, being accountable, attitude. ''You're not doing this for a G.E.D. certificate or to get a lower bunk pass or an extra bowl of Wheaties,'' \uc2 Santos\uc2  said, but to attain ''success as you define it.'' No matter how energized Santos might get talking about these expanding programs, he's still the jailhouse philosopher and epigrammatic inmate who can casually sit back at the end of a riff to tell you that he means to upend the entire American penitentiary system through the prisoners themselves -- to bend the arc of justice back to its history, when confinement was a call not for sadism and misery but for contrition and deliverance.\par \par \uc2 On the morning of Mejia's sentencing last November, Mejia met up with Paperny outside a coffee shop in Santa Ana. It was on an elegant block shaded by Chinese elm trees and crepe myrtle -- with the stunning, new Ronald Reagan Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse looming high above. Clerks and bailiffs with their belt badges and ID lanyards stood around drinking coffees. Mejia showed up in a shiny new suit and introduced Paperny to his fianc\u233\'00\'E9e and his mother. He excitedly told us that the day before, his lawyer briefed him on some new, clever arguments he would be using to ask for no jail time, just probation and home confinement.\par \par \uc2 Paperny held out an open hand, as if to slow things down, and reminded Mejia that the state was asking for nearly five years. It would be unusual for a judge to stiff a prosecutor by giving Mejia no time at all. ''I wouldn't be surprised if you got three years,'' he said, trying to lower expectations. Paperny often finds himself at odds with the lawyers, mostly over details where he's relying on his own hard-won experience.\par \par \uc2 The expectations game aside, Paperny was very concerned, agitated almost, about some specific advice he had written to Mejia in emails and mentioned in numerous Zoom consults. There were a series of steps that had to be taken to secure the best possible outcome. There would be a back and forth between the two lawyers, and then the judge would pronounce a sentence. Right afterward, Mejia had to make sure his lawyer asked two questions: Will the judge recommend a drug-rehabilitation program? (This can knock up to a year off a sentence.) And would the judge recommend that Mejia go to the low-security camp in Oregon?\par \par \uc2 Inside, Judge Cormac Carney of Federal District Court reviewed the details of the crime and noted that his sentencing guidelines called for 57 to 71 months. Before he invited each side to make arguments about what the actual sentence should be, he spoke expansively about Mejia's army experience, his hardship as a child, his eye disease -- clearly, some version of Mejia's biography had made its way to the judge's bench through the official bureaucratic channels that Paperny taught him to work. Then the prosecutor, Jason Pang, took the lectern and also admitted that he was impressed with Mejia's story, noting that Mejia's plea and expression of remorse were ''worthy things'' and that his military service was ''something that the court needs to consider.'' He recommended ''the low end of the sentencing guidelines.''\par \par \uc2 Mejia's court-appointed attorney, Michael Crain, stepped up and dialed things all the way back to the case itself. Mejia got busted, he explained, because a confidential informant got him talking about laundering money with crypto. Crain challenged the government's tactics, arguing that the C.I. was probably trying to lower his own sentence and that much of what Mejia had said that implicated him in major felonies was really nothing more than ''puffery.'' You could almost feel the air in the room change -- the morality play we'd all been watching had become a courtroom drama. He went on to pull from that week's headlines, pointing out that the day before the QAnon Shaman had gotten only 41 months in connection with the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. With that, Crain asked for probation. No jail time.\par \par \uc2 ''Well, after hearing from everybody,'' Carney said, ''I am going to impose a custodial sentence of 36 months. Three years.'' Mejia's mother, who was seated in the gallery, lowered her head. The room went silent. Paperny sat up on the edge of the bench, grabbing the back of the pew in front, and strained to make direct eye contact with Mejia, who didn't forget. He leaned over and whispered to Crain, who asked if the judge would back Mejia's request for drug rehab.\par \par \uc2 ''I will make a strong recommendation for that,'' he said cheerfully. Then Crain said he had another request. Mejia had asked him to be placed in a particular prison. ''My experience has been, I don't think the court is going to recommend a particular facility,'' he said very politely, ''but if the court is inclined to do so, we have a name in mind.''\par \par \uc2 ''I'll do it,'' Carney said.\par \par \uc2 ''It would be the Sheridan federal prison camp that's in Oregon,'' Crain said.\par \par \uc2 ''I'll make the recommendation,'' the judge said.\par \par \uc2 Paperny clenched his fist behind the bench and, safe from judicial review, pumped the smallest bit of air.\par \par \uc2 Within hours, many news outlets ran the story about a major financial criminal getting hard time. (Fox Business: ''Man gets 3-year prison sentence for Bitcoin money laundering.'') But outside the courtroom, Paperny, full of pep, pulled Mejia aside and explained the math. ''The day you show up, you'll get five months off for good time, that's 31 months,'' he said. ''And you'll get nine months off for completing the drug program, that's 22. And you'll probably get seven or eight months in the halfway house, so it's 12 to 13 months.'' Throw in his health issues and the Cares Act, if it applies, and Mejia might be home in less than a year. Paperny added that he had a few clients currently in Sheridan who would be there, first thing, like a welcome wagon.\par \par \uc2 It took a while before Mejia brightened up and then grew chatty. He turned to me to marvel over this odd sense of relief he was feeling -- of ''clarity,'' he said. Paperny whipped out a selfie stick, and he and Mejia recorded a real-time video about what just happened and Mejia's sense of purpose. Michael Santos, who was not there, was very much there. After Paperny turned off his phone, Mejia's talk quickly shifted to his businesses, the future. He told his family he was going to make the businesses run while he's gone. He was in full planning mode. There was plenty of time before he had to report to prison for him to make it into a ''turnkey situation'' for his employees. Down at the corner, a fresh set of bailiffs and clerks sipped their lattes. Just past the Chinese elm trees, Mejia took his fianc\u233\'00\'E9e's hand, and they walked away.\par \par \uc2 Jack Hitt is the creator and a co-host of the 2017 Peabody Award-winning podcast ''Uncivil.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Crypto interests are lobbying Gov. \uc2 Kathy Hochul\uc2  to veto a groundbreaking bill that would temporarily halt new crypto-mining projects at fossil-fuel burning plants.\par \par \uc2 ALBANY, N.Y. -- Across the nation, some states are trying to entice cryptocurrency mining companies to set up shop, offering tax incentives in the hopes of creating jobs and of expanding their footing in the tech industry.\par \par \uc2 In New York, lawmakers have moved in a different direction: In the waning hours of its 2022 session, the State Legislature last week unexpectedly passed a bill that would impose a two-year ban on new cryptocurrency mining permits, specifically at fossil-fuel burning plants, which some businesses have repurposed to power the energy-intensive activity.\par \par \uc2 The groundbreaking legislation, which would make New York the first state to enact such a moratorium, has the potential to influence regulations in other states or at the federal level.\par \par \uc2 The passage of the bill marked a significant defeat for a burgeoning, deep-pocketed industry at the hands of a grass-roots coalition of left-leaning lawmakers, climate activists and even winemakers, who argued that there would be an environmental cost to future cryptocurrency mining.\par \par \uc2 ''Other blue states could potentially introduce legislation like this, based on the efforts of the environmental lobby,'' said John Olsen, the lead representative in New York for the \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Association, an industry group that opposed the moratorium. ''That's certainly a concern.''\par \par \uc2 It is not clear, however, whether Gov. \uc2 Kathy Hochul\uc2  will sign the bill. And the cryptocurrency industry is expected to invest heavily in efforts to persuade her to reject the measure and to seek to influence other industry-friendly regulations in Albany.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hochul's campaign has already received $40,000 from Ashton Soniat, the chief executive of Coinmint, which has a crypto-mining operation on the grounds of a former aluminum plant in Massena, N.Y., a small town northeast of Niagara Falls.\par \par \uc2 A far larger political gift has gone to Ms. Hochul's lieutenant governor, Antonio Delgado, who is facing two primary challengers this month. A super PAC, backed by the founder of FTX, a major cryptocurrency exchange, has spent roughly $1 million on digital ads in the last few weeks in support of his campaign, according to state filings.\par \par \uc2 Michael Levine, a spokesman for the super PAC, said it was solely focused on supporting candidates it believes will back pandemic readiness measures. But the five ads it is running statewide also highlight Mr. Delgado's work on climate change, infrastructure, abortion and schools.\par \par \uc2 The firm is also paying $12,000 a month to a consulting firm, Hinman Straub, to lobby the state government on cryptocurrency regulations, according to state records. \uc2 Sam Bankman\uc2 -Fried, the founder of FTX, said in a statement that the company had applied for a trust charter to operate in New York and has been engaged in conversations with regulators about its application.\par \par \uc2 The governor, a moderate Democrat facing a primary election on June 28, has been noncommittal on whether she would sign the bill, a priority of environmental activists and the party's left flank. Ms. Hochul likely won't have to make a decision until Dec. 31.\par \par \uc2 ''We'll be looking at all the bills very, very closely,'' Ms. Hochul said during a news conference in Manhattan on Tuesday. ''We have a lot of work to do over the next six months.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Hochul has previously said that she was ''open minded'' about the moratorium, but that she was also mindful of not enacting legislation that could impede job creation in the upstate communities, where many of the mining operations are based.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin mining is a verification process essential to the Bitcoin economy. Powerful computers plug into the Bitcoin network and perform complex mathematical tasks to confirm the legitimacy of transactions, making quintillions of numeric guesses a second. As a reward for this service, the digital miners receive new Bitcoins, providing a financial incentive to keep the computers running.\par \par \uc2 In Bitcoin's early years, a crypto enthusiast could mine coins by running software at home, but as digital assets have become more popular, the amount of power necessary to generate Bitcoin has soared.\par \par \uc2 As cryptocurrencies have grown in value, Bitcoin mining has become a major industry. There are publicly traded crypto mining companies like \uc2 Riot \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  and \uc2 Marathon Digital Holdings\uc2 , worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Though estimates vary, there appear to be 19 mining operations in New York that are either fully operational or that could be by the end of the year, according to Assemblywoman Anna Kelles, a Democrat who sponsored the bill in the lower chamber.\par \par \uc2 The measure passed by the Democratic-controlled State Legislature is meant to narrowly target crypto-mining companies looking to repurpose some of the oldest, dirtiest fossil fuel plants in New York as they are taken out of service.\par \par \uc2 For the next two years, the bill would place a moratorium on new projects that utilize fossil-fuel plants to generate ''behind the meter'' electricity for crypto-mining, and require the state to study the industry's impact.\par \par \uc2 ''Any delay in signing the bill puts our state at a serious risk of many old, inefficient, retired power plants being purchased and turned back on for consolidated crypto-mining operations for private profit,'' Ms. Kelles said.\par \par \uc2 The proposed ban drew intense opposition from national cryptocurrency industry groups that worried the moratorium could be a precursor for similar regulations nationwide, and some lawmakers who said it unfairly targeted the fledgling industry.\par \par \uc2 The industry has had a warmer welcome in other states, leading some opponents of the ban to argue that those interested in mining in New York may simply relocate. Last year, Kentucky passed a pair of bills creating tax incentives for crypto-mining companies. Legislation proposed in Illinois in January would modify a state law to extend incentives to mining companies that set up shop there. And Texas and Georgia have both adopted friendly postures toward the industry.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a shame the Legislature has voted to impose a moratorium on Bitcoin miners in New York,'' Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, an industry advocacy group, said in a statement. ''This is a significant setback for the state and will stifle its future as a leader in technology and global financial services.''\par \par \uc2 The bill had passed the Assembly in April, but it had stalled for weeks in the Senate until it was unexpectedly revived and passed just before the Senate gaveled out of session early Friday morning, following frenzied lobbying efforts and late night discussions.\par \par \uc2 Senator Kevin Parker, a Democrat from Brooklyn who sponsored the bill, said that it was not meant to discourage the industry. ''If folks want to do cryptocurrency mining in the state of New York, which I'm very open to, then we need to do it in a sustainable way,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 The legislation in New York comes after China cracked down on crypto mining last year, forcing some operations to relocate to the United States. Some miners are now reviving broken-down coal plants, or using low-cost natural gas, to power their computers.\par \par \uc2 In New York, the spaces available for such businesses are former power plants scattered across upstate that were among the state's most polluting and inefficient. Restarting them would reverse the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that those shutdowns achieved. That would slow the state's progress toward climate goals that it is legally bound to meet, amid growing concern that it is already behind schedule.\par \par \uc2 The bill would not affect crypto mining projects that draw electricity from the grid. But some supporters say those, too, should be banned because they would hog precious electricity as the state scrambles to electrify houses, buildings and cars to meet climate goals.\par \par \uc2 The moratorium also would not affect existing projects like the highly debated one in Greenidge, on Seneca Lake, even though residents and tourism businesses in the surrounding Finger Lakes region championed the bill to prevent similar projects from taking root.\par \par \uc2 Also unaffected are boutique crypto miners, like individuals who operate from their homes, an important distinction meant to preserve crypto's potential benefit to marginalized people, according to Ms. Kelles.\par \par \uc2 The Senate had passed a broader version of the cryptocurrency moratorium bill last year, but it failed to gain sufficient traction in the Assembly. When the moratorium proposal resurfaced in 2022, during an election year for state lawmakers, it quickly became a hot-button issue as environmental groups renewed their push and the cryptocurrency industry began to marshal its own lobbying forces.\par \par \uc2 While some Democrats facing potential primaries from the left came under pressure to support this and other environmental legislation, others spoke out forcefully against it, arguing it would kill jobs and unfairly target one industry while letting other energy-intensive industries off the hook.\par \par \uc2 ''I think the majority of members still don't understand the industry and the technology,'' said State Senator Jeremy Cooney, a Democrat from Rochester, who opposed the moratorium. ''This is bigger than cryptocurrency. This is about, will New York be an open and inviting place to do business and engage in emerging technologies.''\par \par \uc2 Lobbyists from two national groups -- the \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Association and the \uc2 Digital Currency Group\uc2  -- also inserted themselves into the debate in New York, seeing the defeat of the bill as necessary to avoid similar legislation from spreading nationwide.\par \par \uc2 Even so, environmental groups kept clamoring, and so did Ms. Kelles, who called and texted her counterparts in the Senate to lobby them directly.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Liz Krueger\uc2 , a high-ranking Democrat from Upper Manhattan, said she also called and texted colleagues to convince them to switch their votes, and lobbied others in-person at the State Capitol on Thursday night.\par \par \uc2 ''Smart entrepreneurs going into the field of cryptocurrency will realize they can build a better mousetrap and get us to buy that if they're not destroying our environment,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Anne Barnard contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 A computer mining cryptocurrency in a former Alcoa aluminum plant in Massena, N.Y. Opponents in New York argue that there will be an environmental cost to future cryptocurrency mining.

\par\par \uc2 PAUL KRUGMAN\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 From the Big Short to the Big Scam\b0\par\par\uc2 By Paul Krugman \par \uc2 921 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 21\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Remember ''The Big Short''? The 2010 book by Michael Lewis, made into a 2015 film, told the story of the 2008 global financial crisis by following a handful of investors who were willing to bet on the unthinkable -- the proposition that the huge rise in housing prices in the years before the crisis was a bubble, and that many of the seemingly sophisticated financial instruments that helped inflate housing would eventually be revealed as worthless junk.\par \par \uc2 Why were so few willing to bet against the bubble? A large part of the answer, I'd suggest, was what we might call the incredulity factor -- the sheer scale of the mispricing the skeptics claimed to see. Even though there was clear evidence that housing prices were out of line, it was hard to believe they could be that far out of line -- that $6 trillion in real estate wealth would evaporate, that investors in mortgage-backed securities would lose around $1 trillion. It just didn't seem plausible that markets, and the conventional wisdom saying that markets were OK, could be that wrong.\par \par \uc2 But they were. Which brings us to the current state of crypto.\par \par \uc2 Last week the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2  reported that ''cryptocurrency is quickly becoming the payment of choice for many scammers,'' accounting for ''about one of every four dollars reported lost to fraud.'' Given how small a role cryptocurrency plays in ordinary transactions, that's impressive.\par \par \uc2 True, the sum reported by the F.T.C. isn't that big -- around $1 billion since 2021 -- but this counts only reported losses to outright fraud, where people were suckered into paying for nonexistent assets. It doesn't count scams that went unreported, let alone money invested in assets that existed, sort of, but were fundamentally worthless -- assets like TerraUSD, a ''stablecoin'' that was neither stable nor a coin. TerraUSD's collapse last month eliminated $18 billion in value, in some cases consuming people's life savings. As far as we know, TerraUSD's founders actually believed in their product and didn't simply steal investors' money, so they didn't engage in fraud in a legal sense. But their investors lost their savings anyway.\par \par \uc2 Who's next? As Hillary Allen recently wrote in The Financial Times, TerraUSD may have been exceptionally fragile, but the truth is that it's hard to see why stablecoins in general should exist. ''Stablecoins start with a convoluted and inefficient base technology in order to avoid intermediaries'' -- that is, conventional banks -- ''and then add intermediaries (often with apparent conflicts of interest) back in.''\par \par \uc2 As a number of analysts have pointed out, stablecoins may seem high-tech and futuristic, but what they most resemble are 19th-century banks, specifically U.S. banks during the ''free banking'' era before the Civil War, when paper currency was issued by largely unregulated private institutions. Many of these banks failed, in some cases due to fraud but mostly due to bad investments.\par \par \uc2 Now, some modern economists defend the free banking era. Perhaps not surprisingly, free-banking defenders, like crypto enthusiasts, tend to have a libertarian bent; the most ardent defenders of free banking are associated with right-wing think tanks that have also promoted environmental denialism and opposed measures against Covid-19. Still, during the free-banking era, private currencies did indeed circulate and function as mediums of exchange.\par \par \uc2 Arguably, however, that was because there were no better alternatives: greenbacks -- dollar notes issued by the \uc2 U.S. Treasury\uc2  -- didn't yet exist. Today greenbacks and government-insured bank deposits do exist, so stablecoins play almost no role in ordinary business transactions. What purpose, then, do these assets serve?\par \par \uc2 You can ask the same question about crypto in general. I've been in a number of meetings in which skeptics ask, as politely as they can, what cryptocurrencies do that can't be done more easily with more conventional means of payment. They also ask why, if crypto is the future, Bitcoin -- which was introduced in 2009(!) -- has yet to find any significant real-world uses. In my experience, the answers are always word salad devoid of concrete examples.\par \par \uc2 OK, criminals seems to find crypto useful; a recent Reuters investigation found that over the past five years the crypto exchange \uc2 Binance\uc2  has laundered at least $2.35 billion in illicit funds. But where are the legitimate applications?\par \par \uc2 Yet suggesting that crypto makes no sense runs up against the incredulity factor. At their peak last November, cryptocurrencies were worth almost $3 trillion; early investors made huge profits. Famous business schools offer \uc2 blockchain\uc2  courses; mayors compete over who can make their cities most crypto-friendly.\par \par \uc2 It sounds extreme and implausible to suggest that an asset class that has become so large, whose promoters have acquired so much political influence, could lack any real value -- that it is a house built not on sand, but on nothing at all.\par \par \uc2 But I remember the housing bubble and the subprime crisis. And if you ask me, it looks as if we've gone from the Big Short to the Big Scam.\par \par \uc2 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

\par\par \uc2 Science Desk; SECTD\par \b \uc2 The Theater Of Bitcoin\b0\par\par\uc2 By Siobhan Roberts \par \uc2 2,470 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Alyssa Blackburn, a data scientist at \uc2 Rice University\uc2  and \uc2 Baylor College of Medicine\uc2  in Houston, has spent several years performing digital detective work with her trusty lab assistant, Hail Mary, a shiny black computer with orange trim. She has been collecting and analyzing leaks from the Bitcoin \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , the immutable public ledger that has recorded all transactions since the cryptocurrency's launch in January 2009.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin represents a techno-utopian dream. \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2 , its pseudonymous inventor, proposed that the world run not on centralized financial institutions but on an egalitarian, math-based electronic money system distributed through a computer network. And the system would be ''trustless'' -- that is, it would not rely on a trusted party, such as a bank or government, to arbitrate transactions. Rather, as \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  wrote in a 2008 white paper, the system would be anchored in ''cryptographic proof instead of trust.'' Or, as T-shirts proclaim: ''In Code We Trust.''\par \par \uc2 The practicalities have proved complicated. Price turbulence is enough to induce the Bitcoin bends, and the system is environmentally destructive, since the computational network uses exorbitant amounts of electricity.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Blackburn said her project was agnostic to Bitcoin's pros and cons. Her goal was to pierce the scrim of anonymity, track the transaction flow from Day 1 and study how the world's largest cryptoeconomy emerged.\par \par \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  had presented the currency as anonymous: For Bitcoin transactions (buying, selling, sending, receiving et cetera), users employ pseudonyms, or addresses -- alphanumeric cloaks that hide their real identities. And there was apparent confidence in the anonymity; in 2011, \uc2 WikiLeaks\uc2  announced that it would accept donations via Bitcoin. But over time, research revealed data leakage; the identity protections weren't so watertight after all.\par \par \uc2 ''Drip-by-drip, information leakage erodes the once-impenetrable blocks, carving out a new landscape of socioeconomic data,'' Ms. Blackburn and her collaborators report in their new paper, which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal.\par \par \uc2 Aggregating multiple leakages, Ms. Blackburn consolidated many Bitcoin addresses, which might have seemed to represent many miners, into few. She pieced together a catalog of agents and concluded that, in those first two years, 64 key players -- some of whom were the community's ''founders,'' as the researchers called them -- mined most of the Bitcoin that existed at the time.\par \par \uc2 ''What they figured out, just how concentrated early mining and use of Bitcoin was, that's a scientific discovery,'' said Eric Budish, an economist at the \uc2 University of Chicago\uc2 . Dr. Budish, who has conducted research in this realm, received a two-hour video preview with the authors. Once he came to understand what they had done, he thought, ''Wow, this is cool detective work,'' he said. Referring to those early key players, Dr. Budish suggested that the paper be titled ''The Bitcoin 64.''\par \par \uc2 The computer scientist \uc2 Jaron Lanier\uc2 , an early reader of the paper, called the investigation ''important and significant'' in its ambitions and social implications. ''The nerd in me is interested in the math,'' said Mr. Lanier, who is based in Berkeley, Calif. ''The techniques used to extract information are interesting.''\par \par \uc2 The demonstration of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  leakage, he noted, will be surprising to some, not to others. ''This thing isn't hermetically sealed,'' Mr. Lanier said. He added: ''I don't think it's the end of the story. I think there's further innovation that will take place, extracting information from these types of systems.''\par \par \uc2 One of Ms. Blackburn's tactics was simple perseverance. ''I kicked it till it broke,'' she said, recalling how the principal investigator, Erez Lieberman Aiden, an applied mathematician, computer scientist and geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine and Rice University, characterized her method.\par \par \uc2 More precisely, Ms. Blackburn developed hacks for the period of time that was of particular interest: from the cryptocurrency's start to when Bitcoin achieved parity with the U.S. dollar in February 2011, which coincided with the establishment of the Silk Road, a Bitcoin-based black market. She leveraged human lapses such as insecure user behavior; she exploited operational features inherent to Bitcoin's software; she deployed established techniques for linking the pseudonymous addresses; and she developed new techniques. Ms. Blackburn was particularly interested in miners, the agents who verify transactions by engaging in an elaborate computational tournament -- a puzzle hunt, of sorts, guessing and checking random numbers against a target, in search of a lucky number. When a miner wins, they earn Bitcoin income.\par \par \uc2 Whether 64 seems like a small or large number of key miners depends on one's proximity to the crypto undertow. Scholars have questioned whether Bitcoin is truly a decentralized currency. From Dr. Lieberman Aiden's perspective, the population under investigation was ''even more concentrated than it seems.'' Although the analysis showed that the big players numbered 64 over two years, at any given moment, according to the researchers' modeling, the effective size of that population was only five or six. And on many occasions, just one or two people held most of the mining power.\par \par \uc2 As Ms. Blackburn described it, there were very few people ''wearing the crown,'' functioning as arbiters of the network -- ''which is not the ethos of decentralized trustless crypto,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Finding treasures in the data\par \par \uc2 For Ms. Blackburn and Dr. Lieberman Aiden, Bitcoin's data -- 324 or so gigabytes archived in the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  -- presented a cache of temptation. Dr. Lieberman Aiden's lab does biological physics and widely applied mathematics; one focus is three-dimensional genome mapping. But as a scholar, he is also intrigued by the use of new kinds of data to explore complex phenomena. In 2011, he published a quantitative cultural analysis using more than five million digitized books from 1800 to 2000, with Google Books and collaborators. ''Culturomics,'' he called it. For instance, the team introduced the \uc2 Google\uc2  Ngram Viewer, which lets users type in a word or phrase and observe its usage plotted over the centuries.\par \par \uc2 In the same spirit, he wondered what treasures might be submersed in Bitcoin's data lake. ''We literally have a record of every single transaction,'' he said. ''These are remarkable economic and sociological data sets. Clearly, there's a lot of information in there, if you can get at it.''\par \par \uc2 Getting at it proved nontrivial. Ms. Blackburn was barred from the university's supercomputing cluster -- with her file folder labeled ''Bitcoin,'' she was suspected of mining the cryptocurrency. ''I objected,'' she said. She said she tried to convince an administrator that she was conducting research, but ''they were completely unmoved.''\par \par \uc2 A key tactic of Ms. Blackburn's was to trace patterns in plots of numbers that in theory should have been random and meaningless. In one case, she was chasing the ''extranonce,'' one piece of the mining puzzle: a short field of 0s and 1s tucked within a longer string that encodes each block, or bundle, of transactions. The extranonce leaked information about a computer's activity. This led Ms. Blackburn to reconstruct the miners' behavior: when they were mining, when they stopped and when they started up again. She speculates that the extranonce's leaky behavior was tolerated because it allowed Bitcoin's creator to keep an eye on miners; the source code was modified to plug this leak shortly before \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  disappeared from the public Bitcoin community in December 2010.\par \par \uc2 Once Ms. Blackburn had put various toeholds to use -- allowing her to erode the identity-masking protections -- she began merging addresses, linking nodes on a graph, consolidating the effective population of mining agents. Then she cross-referenced and validated the results with information scraped from Bitcoin discussion forums and blogs. Initially, the catalog of agents who mined most of the Bitcoin tallied a couple of thousand; then it hovered for a while around 200. Ultimately, Hail Mary spit out 64. (Eventually, Hail Mary's brains were incorporated into the lab's computer cluster, Voltron.)\par \par \uc2 The study's purpose was not to name names; it's the job of the F.B.I. and the I.R.S. to bust Bitcoin criminals. But the researchers pinpointed the identities of a couple of the top players who were publicly known Bitcoin criminals: Agent No. 19 is Michael Mancil Brown, a.k.a. ''Dr. Evil,'' who was found guilty of a 2012 fraud and extortion scheme involving Mitt Romney, then a candidate for president. Agent No. 67 is associated with Ross Ulbricht, a.k.a. ''DreadPirateRoberts,'' creator of the Silk Road. Naturally, Agent No. 1 is \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  -- whose true identity the researchers did not try to determine.\par \par \uc2 Mark Gerstein, a professor of bioinformatics at \uc2 Yale University\uc2 , found in the research implications for data privacy. He recently stored a genome on a private \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , which allowed for a secure and tamperproof record. But he noted that in a public setting, as with Bitcoin's \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , a data set's size and subtle patterns made it susceptible to breaches, even as the data remained immutable. (Ms. Blackburn wasn't tampering with the Bitcoin \uc2 blockchain\uc2 's records.)\par \par \uc2 ''That's the amazing thing about big data,'' Dr. Gerstein said. ''If you have a big enough data set, it starts to leak information in unexpected ways.'' Even more so when data from different sources are connected, he said: ''When you combine one data set with another to make a bigger data set, nonobvious linkages can arise.''\par \par \uc2 'Decentralization theater'\par \par \uc2 Once Ms. Blackburn had assembled the catalog of agents, she analyzed the income they had reaped from mining. She found that within a few months of the cryptocurrency's introduction -- and contrary to Bitcoin's egalitarian promise -- a classic distribution of income inequality emerged: A small fraction of the miners held most of the wealth and power. (Mining income demonstrated what is called a Pareto distribution, after Vilfredo Pareto, a 19th-century economist.)\par \par \uc2 The lab unintentionally replicated this dynamic when they invented ''CO2 coin,'' a cryptocurrency that could be used to buy snacks from a student-run store. In due course, some CO2 miners became more successful than others, and the store marked up snack prices catering to the tastes of the rich.\par \par \uc2 ''The people who had a lot of crypto resources had very strong control over what the store would acquire, which other people didn't feel great about,'' Dr. Lieberman Aiden recalled. The economy collapsed -- that is, there was a revolt -- when the shop began charging in CO2 to use the coffee machine.\par \par \uc2 In the formal study, Ms. Blackburn also observed that the concentration of resources threatened the network's security, with a miner's computational resources being directly proportionate to his or her mining income. On several occasions, individual miners wielded more than 50 percent of the computational power and, as a result, could have taken over like a tyrant using what's called a ''51 percent attack.'' For instance, they could have cheated the system and repeatedly spent the same Bitcoins on different transactions.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Meiklejohn, a cryptographer at \uc2 University College London\uc2 , said that the investigation's findings\u226\'00\'E2\u8364\'20\'AC\u353\'01\'61 assuming they were error-free, provide empirical confirmation of an ''intuition that has been floating around in this space for a while.'' (Dr. Meiklejohn developed some address-linking techniques used in the investigation and recently devised a technique for tracking a type of transaction flow called a peel chain.)\par \par \uc2 ''We all kind of knew that mining was fairly centralized,'' she said. ''There aren't that many miners. This is true even today, of course, and it was even more true at the beginning.'' As for what should be done about it, ''we do need to really examine that question,'' she said. ''How do we make mining more decentralized?'' She thought the results of this investigation might encourage the field to take the issue more seriously.\par \par \uc2 But to add a twist, Ms. Blackburn found that while some miners had the power to execute 51 percent attacks, they repeatedly chose not to. Rather, they acted altruistically -- preserving the cryptocurrency's integrity, even though the decentralization-based fraud-prevention mechanism had been compromised.\par \par \uc2 In parsing this finding, Ms. Blackburn's team turned to the tools of experimental economics. They gathered human subjects online to participate in game-theory scenarios that modeled the ''social dilemma'' faced by the founders -- that is, how people behave when they find themselves as the trustee of an appreciating good.\par \par \uc2 ''In scenarios like this, it appears that people don't like to kill the golden goose -- they don't like to spoil it for the group,'' Dr. Lieberman Aiden observed. Whatever you believe about the motivations of the ''Bitcoin 64,'' he said, the fact that the network was vulnerable to individual decision makers changes the understanding of its security.\par \par \uc2 ''Sure, decentralization protects the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 ,'' he said. ''But even on occasions when the mining pool became centralized, the dominant miners declined to attack it. That is a very different picture than the idealized model people have for why these cryptocurrencies are secure.''\par \par \uc2 As the authors concluded in the paper: ''Although Bitcoin was designed to rely on a decentralized, trustless network of anonymous agents, its early success rested instead on cooperation among a small group of altruistic founders.''\par \par \uc2 For Glen Weyl, an economist at \uc2 Microsoft Research\uc2  who was consulted on the research, this finding demonstrates how decentralization played a rhetorical rather than substantive role. ''And that rhetorical role was very powerful -- it bound together this community, much as other myths have bound together other communities, like nations,'' Dr. Weyl said. But the myth and the promise, he said, were in tension with the reality that emerged. ''It's just fascinatingly ironic, and also predictable, repeating the historical patterns it aspires to erase.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lanier called it ''decentralization theater.'' Cryptocurrencies create an illusion: '''Now we're in utopia. Everything's decentralized. Everybody's equal.' There's this notion of democracy without annoyance.''\par \par \uc2 But, he said, these systems end up hiding a new elite, which is probably just an old elite in a new arena. And the technology cuts both ways. ''Whatever you think you can achieve using new algorithms, or big data, or whatever, can also be used against you,'' Mr. Lanier said. ''The same algorithms can be used by scientists to interrogate and investigate these castles that are put up by the new elite.''\par \par \uc2 One moral of the story, Ms. Blackburn said, is simply: ''You have to be careful.'' There is a limited timeline for encryption, ''a horizon beyond which it will no longer be useful. When you are encrypting private data and making it public, you cannot assume that it'll be private forever.''\par \par \uc2 Alyssa Blackburn, left, a data scientist, and Erez Lieberman Aiden, a computer scientist, tested Bitcoin's identity protections and claims of decentralization.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Thefts, Fraud and Lawsuits At Large NFT Marketplace\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,821 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 OpenSea, one of the highest-profile crypto start-ups, is facing a backlash over stolen and plagiarized nonfungible tokens.\par \par \uc2 Chris Chapman used to own one of the most valuable commodities in the crypto world: a unique digital image of a spiky-haired ape dressed in a spacesuit.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chapman bought the nonfungible token last year, as a widely hyped series of digital collectibles called the Bored Ape Yacht Club became a phenomenon. In December, he listed his Bored Ape for sale on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, setting the price at about $1 million. Two months later, as he got ready to take his daughters to the zoo, OpenSea sent him a notification: The ape had been sold for roughly $300,000.\par \par \uc2 A crypto scammer exploited a flaw in OpenSea's system to buy the ape for significantly less than its worth, said Mr. Chapman, who runs a construction business in Texas. Last month, OpenSea offered him about $30,000 in compensation, he said, which he turned down in hopes of negotiating a larger payout.\par \par \uc2 The company has made ''a lot of stupid, dumb mistakes,'' Mr. Chapman, 35, said. ''They don't really know what they're doing.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chapman is one of many crypto enthusiasts who have raised questions about OpenSea, an \uc2 eBay\uc2 -like site where people can browse millions of NFTs, buy the images and put their own up for sale. In the last 18 months, OpenSea has become the dominant NFT marketplace and one of the highest-profile crypto start-ups. The company has raised more than $400 million from investors, valuing it at a staggering $13.3 billion, and recruited executives from tech giants like \uc2 Meta\uc2  and \uc2 Lyft\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But as OpenSea has grown, it has struggled to prevent theft and fraud. The glitch that cost Mr. Chapman his ape has led to months of recriminations, forcing the start-up to make more than $6 million in payouts to NFT traders.\par \par \uc2 Customers also complain that OpenSea is slow to block the sale of NFTs that were seized by hackers, who can turn a quick profit by flipping the stolen goods. And plagiarized art has proliferated on the site, outraging artists who once viewed NFTs as a financial lifeline. The company is facing at least four lawsuits from traders, and one of its former executives was indicted this month on charges related to insider trading involving NFTs.\par \par \uc2 OpenSea's troubles are piling up just as demand for NFTs cools amid a crash in cryptocurrency prices. NFT sales have dropped about 90 percent since September, according to the industry data tracker NonFungible. OpenSea is also contending with competition from newer marketplaces built by established crypto companies like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The company's clashes with users illustrate some of the central tensions of web3, a utopian vision of a more democratic internet controlled by regular people rather than giant tech companies. Like many crypto platforms, OpenSea does not collect the names of most of its customers and advertises itself as a ''self-serve'' gateway to a loosely regulated market. But users increasingly want the company to act more like a traditional business by compensating fraud victims and cracking down on theft.\par \par \uc2 In three interviews, OpenSea executives acknowledged the scale of the problems and said the company was taking steps to improve trust and safety. OpenSea, which is based in New York, has hired more customer-service staff, with the aim of responding to all complaints within 24 hours. The company freezes listings of stolen NFTs and has a new screening process to prevent plagiarized content from circulating on the platform.\par \par \uc2 ''Like every tech company, there's a period where you're catching up,'' said Devin Finzer, 31, OpenSea's chief executive. ''You're trying to do everything you can to accommodate the brand-new users that are coming into the space.''\par \par \uc2 OpenSea was founded four and a half years ago by Mr. Finzer, a \uc2 Brown University\uc2  graduate whose previous start-up, a personal-finance app, was sold to the financial technology company \uc2 Credit Karma\uc2 , and Alex Atallah, a former engineer at the software firm \uc2 Palantir\uc2 . They are now among the world's richest crypto billionaires, according to Forbes.\par \par \uc2 Their business model is simple. OpenSea takes a 2.5 percent cut each time an NFT is sold on its platform. Last year, business spiked as NFTs became a cultural sensation and the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies skyrocketed.\par \par \uc2 Practically overnight, OpenSea went from an obscure start-up to one of the most powerful middlemen in the crypto industry, which soon led to problems.\par \par \uc2 ''It would be difficult for any company to pivot and accommodate that kind of increase so quickly,'' said Carrie Presley, who worked for OpenSea for a few months last year. ''It was very chaotic.''\par \par \uc2 Because OpenSea collects a fee from each NFT sale, some users argue that the company has a financial incentive not to clamp down on the sale of stolen goods. This year, Robert Armijo, an investor in Nevada, sued OpenSea for failing to stop a hacker who had stolen several of his NFTs from selling one of them on the platform. (OpenSea's lawyers called the complaint ''a nonstarter'' and said the company acted promptly to stop the other stolen NFTs from being sold.)\par \par \uc2 In February, Eli Shapira, a former tech executive, clicked on a link that he said gave a hacker access to the digital wallet where he stores his NFTs. The thief sold two of Mr. Shapira's most valuable NFTs on OpenSea for a total of more than $100,000.\par \par \uc2 Within hours, Mr. Shapira contacted OpenSea to report the hack. But the company never took action, he said. Since then, he has used public data to track the account that seized his NFTs and has seen the hacker sell other images on OpenSea, possibly from more thefts.\par \par \uc2 ''It's very easy for these hackers to go and open an account there and immediately trade or sell whatever they've stolen,'' Mr. Shapira said. ''All of these guys need to step up security.''\par \par \uc2 Last month, after \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  asked OpenSea about the case, the company responded to Mr. Shapira and froze any future sales of the stolen NFTs.\par \par \uc2 Anne Fauvre-Willis, who oversees OpenSea's customer-support efforts, said the company had been working to improve response times when users reported thefts.\par \par \uc2 ''Getting faster is important,'' she said. ''That's something that we are investing in today and will continue to make a huge investment on going forward.''\par \par \uc2 OpenSea has also seen a surge of plagiarism, as sellers convert traditional artwork into NFTs and then list the images for sale without compensating the original creator.\par \par \uc2 DeviantArt, an artists' collective owned by the web-development firm Wix, runs software that scans millions of NFTs every day to detect images plagiarized from the work of its artists. The program has identified more than 290,000 instances of plagiarism on OpenSea and other NFT marketplaces.\par \par \uc2 ''There is almost no kind of accountability,'' said Liat Karpel Gurwicz, DeviantArt's chief marketing officer.\par \par \uc2 OpenSea offers a tool that lets people create NFTs with a few clicks, converting regular images into unique items whose authenticity is recorded on a public ledger called a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . In January, the company said it would limit the number of NFTs that users could make with the tool. But after a backlash from NFT fans, OpenSea reversed course and said in a tweet that it would eliminate the cap, even though many of the new creations had turned out to be ''plagiarized works, fake collections and spam.''\par \par \uc2 ''They've bastardized the concept of what NFTs were supposed to be,'' said Aja Trier, an artist in Texas whose work has been copied and sold on OpenSea. ''It dilutes the market for my work.''\par \par \uc2 In May, OpenSea announced that it was using image-recognition technology to crack down on plagiarism. But the scanning service compares newly uploaded images only with other NFTs listed on OpenSea, making it unlikely to detect artwork plagiarized from other websites.\par \par \uc2 Shiva Rajaraman, a former vice president at \uc2 Meta\uc2  and \uc2 Spotify\uc2  who works on OpenSea's product team, said the company hoped to expand its anti-plagiarism dragnet. ''We'll work on partnerships with other people to get that original work,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chapman, a former college basketball player, started experimenting with crypto last year. He bought a Bored Ape for a few hundred dollars, and later traded it for the ape in astronaut gear because it evoked the space age history of Houston, his hometown. He started wearing a Bored Ape sweatshirt, and his mother-in-law bought him an ape-branded water bottle.\par \par \uc2 In September, Mr. Chapman listed his space ape on OpenSea, setting the price at 90 Ether. Three months later, he raised the price to 269 Ether, or about $1.1 million, in line with the skyrocketing value of other Bored Ape NFTs. He was planning to sell the NFT for enough that he could immediately buy another, less valuable space ape and pocket any profits from the trade.\par \par \uc2 In February, the ape sold for the original listing of 90 Ether, or roughly $300,000. Savvy traders had exploited a glitch that allowed them to activate out-of-date sales listings on OpenSea.\par \par \uc2 On Feb. 18, Mr. Finzer announced that OpenSea had updated its technology to prevent thieves from reactivating old listings. The company reimbursed some victims, asking them to sign nondisclosure agreements in exchange for payouts.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chapman said OpenSea had initially offered him a refund of just the 2.5 percent fee it received when his space ape was sold. Last month, he said, OpenSea increased its offer to 15 Ether, or a little under $30,000 at today's prices, after his lawyer wrote to the company. OpenSea declined to comment on his case.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chapman is holding out for a bigger reimbursement. As the owner of a Bored Ape NFT, he would have been entitled to a large share of ApeCoin, a cryptocurrency that was launched in March. Ape NFT owners each received a chunk of coins worth more than $100,000 at the time.\par \par \uc2 Because he had lost his ape, Mr. Chapman missed out on his anticipated ApeCoin windfall, which he had planned to use to buy a house close to his wife's family outside downtown Houston.\par \par \uc2 ''I could have the ApeCoin right now, and have a down payment for my house,'' he said. ''That's all gone.''\par \par \uc2 Chris Chapman said a flaw in OpenSea's system allowed a trader to buy his NFT for less than a third of the price.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Worker at NFT Site Faces Insider Trading Charges\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 522 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 6\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The employee of OpenSea was released on $100,000 bail after pleading not guilty.\par \par \uc2 Manhattan prosecutors on Wednesday accused a former employee of OpenSea, an auction site for the digital goods known as nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, of insider trading. It is believed to be the first such case filed related to a cryptocurrency company.\par \par \uc2 Nathaniel Chastain, a 31-year-old former product manager at OpenSea, is accused of using his knowledge of which NFTs would be featured on the site's home page to secretly purchase from those collections in advance and then profit when auctions increased their value, according to a report in the DealBook newsletter.\par \par \uc2 ''Today's charges demonstrate the commitment of this office to stamping out insider trading -- whether it occurs on the stock market or the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 ,'' said \uc2 Damian Williams\uc2 , the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. The Justice Department, in the past year, has expanded its crypto enforcement team and brought more fraud cases related to digital assets in an effort to send the message that it is keeping an eye on the market.\par \par \uc2 The criminal case may be the first of its kind, but NFT frauds and hacks are common, and the case lends credence to the concerns of some critics that the culture of anonymity on \uc2 blockchain\uc2  platforms attracts untrustworthy actors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chastain was arrested on Wednesday and released on $100,000 bail after pleading not guilty. His lawyer declined to comment to reporters after the hearing.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chastain is accused of taking advantage of anonymous digital wallets and accounts in the alledged fraud. Last summer, he bought about 45 NFTs on at least 11 occasions, selling them at two to five times as much as he paid for them, according to the indictment. He moved cryptocurrency and digital collectibles among anonymous Ethereum wallets and OpenSea accounts he had set up.\par \par \uc2 Proponents say NFTs create a new kind of value by authenticating ownership of digital files of all kinds, including art, audio and video. Last year, it seemed that suddenly almost everyone was into NFTs. Mr. Chastain rode that wave. While insider trading usually involves publicly traded securities, the indictment does not get into whether NFTs fall into that category. It focuses instead on accusations of Mr. Chastain's abuse of OpenSea's confidential business information, which would have violated an agreement he signed when he was hired.\par \par \uc2 ''When we learned of Nate's behavior, we initiated an investigation and ultimately asked him to leave the company,'' a spokesman from OpenSea said in a statement. ''His behavior was in violation of our employee policies and in direct conflict with our core values and principles.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Chastain was charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of money laundering, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years. If convicted, he will have to forfeit the NFTs he bought in the scheme. Will any potential notoriety from the case increase the value of his collectibles? Perhaps they'll be auctioned on OpenSea again.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220603ei630004o\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 TIMES INSIDER\par \uc2 Metropolitan Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Keeping Up With Cryptocurrency\b0\par\par\uc2 By Emmett Lindner \par \uc2 919 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 June 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 David Yaffe-Bellany, who covers cryptocurrencies for The Times, talks about the crash of an industry that is firmly rooted in global culture.\par \par \uc2 Times Insider explains who we are and what we do and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\par \par \uc2 In an ad campaign during the 2022 Super Bowl, the actor Matt Damon stands on a ship in outer space, looking out over a giant red planet. ''Fortune favors the brave,'' he says. Super Bowl ads can cost up to $7 million for 30 seconds; this one was for Crypto.com and championed those brave enough to invest in what was then a booming industry. Three months later, crypto came crashing down.\par \par \uc2 Several digital currencies collapsed in mid-May, and more than $300 billion was wiped out after a price drop. The price of Bitcoin, for example, plunged from a high last year of nearly $70,000 a share to less than $30,000. Some crypto investors who had become millionaires lost it all.\par \par \uc2 David Yaffe-Bellany, who has covered cryptocurrencies and fintech for The Times since January, has reported on the industry while it soared to new heights -- and as it suddenly came tumbling down. In an interview, he talked about covering a complicated beat that looms large over global culture. This interview has been edited.\par \par \uc2 How do you think about reporting on crypto?\par \par \uc2 People in the industry talk about crypto years the same way we talk about dog years because the industry is changing so quickly. Since I first started this job, the energy around crypto has changed a few times. We're still in that boom period, to some degree. There are still tons of crypto companies starting out, still spending lots of money. But there's a sense now that we're in a crypto winter. Now, a lot of what we're doing is trying to assess the damage of what happened in the crypto crash, especially to regular investors. And we're trying to figure out what the story lines will be over the rest of the year, as the market actually goes down even more and crypto companies try to stabilize.\par \par \uc2 We're writing for an audience that is still trying to get its head around this complicated world. Participating in that kind of process with them -- and getting experts to explain how things work in the most concise, straightforward way possible -- is really valuable.\par \par \uc2 There's a real intellectual richness in trying to understand how all of this works and the financial engineering and the philosophical underpinnings -- but also it's an industry populated by people with wild personalities who are trying to do really ambitious things. Watching them succeed to some degree and fail to some degree is very journalistically interesting.\par \par \uc2 You were hired to cover crypto in January. What was happening in the crypto world at the time that made you want to cover it?\par \par \uc2 Last year was huge for crypto. A lot of my early discussions about the job involved questions like, how do we convey this kind of boom atmosphere to our readers? The price of Bitcoin reached nearly $70,000 in November, the highest it's ever been. Companies were forming practically every day; venture capital firms were splashing billions of dollars funding new crypto start-ups. And culturally, crypto was permeating everything. Sports teams were naming their stadiums after crypto companies, there were commercials with big celebrities. I think regular people were constantly getting bombarded by crypto and trying to figure out what it all meant.\par \par \uc2 Has anything during your coverage surprised you?\par \par \uc2 I have been pleasantly surprised by the willingness of people in the industry to open up and tell us about their projects and be relatively candid about their concerns about the future of the industry. There's a lot of rhetoric in the crypto industry that's very critical of the mainstream press. But I've found that, for the most part, people are willing to engage with us, understanding that we're writing for an audience that's not as immersed in the daily ups and downs of the market.\par \par \uc2 Do you view crypto as something tied to other cultural trends?\par \par \uc2 It claims that it's going to transform the art world and it's going to transform all sorts of industries outside of the normal tech industry. Fashion companies will be able to authenticate designer clothing using the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , the real estate industry will be transformed because this will be a way to verify property ownership. You have to be open to dipping your toe into those other ecosystems -- as well as trying to understand them as thoroughly as you can.\par \par \uc2 I think the crypto markets are more closely tied to the traditional markets than crypto evangelists are comfortable with. The foundational idea of crypto was that it would be this independent store of value that wouldn't be influenced by the constantly changing macroeconomic trends that are affecting the broader markets. But we certainly haven't reached a point yet where crypto is isolated from those broader trends in terms of its long term prospects.\par \par \uc2 It's very hard to predict. The crash of the last month has been bad, but crypto is not over. The industry isn't dead. Prices could go way back up in the next month. The volatility of the market is something that we've seen over and over.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220603ei6300047\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The cryptocurrency market has been in a meltdown. Digital currencies, along with other \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based properties, have plunged in value, lending credence to skeptics who have regarded the crypto phenomenon as a fad.\par \par \uc2 But crypto companies appear to be here to stay in New York, at least for the foreseeable future, judging from the way they have been leasing Manhattan office space.\par \par \uc2 It would seem contradictory that businesses known for decentralization and digital assets are even interested in real-world space. Remote work is common at many web3 companies, which include cryptocurrencies and platforms for nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. And companies are reconsidering the role of the office after the success of work-from-home efforts during the pandemic and the subsequent embrace of hybrid schedules.\par \par \uc2 But for the last couple of years, cryptocurrency firms have been setting up or expanding offices in New York, often in edgier, somewhat peripheral locations, as opposed to marquee parts of Midtown Manhattan.\par \par \uc2 This month, Solana Labs, a cryptocurrency platform, signed a lease for 20,000 square feet across four floors of a new office building in the Bowery. A few blocks away, EmpireDAO, whose name incorporates the acronym for ''decentralized autonomous organization,'' has opened a co-working space for crypto entrepreneurs in a graffiti-covered building.\par \par \uc2 Manhattan office availability rates hit 19 percent in May, up from about 12 percent before the pandemic, according to \uc2 Newmark\uc2 , a real estate firm, and landlords have welcomed the new category of companies, many of them having secured recent rounds of fund-raising.\par \par \uc2 But it is unclear how the turbulence in the market will affect the longevity of some web3 companies. And the flurry of real estate activity is unlikely to make a dent in the vacancy problem because there are so few of these companies and they tend to take short-term leases for modest amounts of space, industry experts say.\par \par \uc2 ''It's still a small tenant in the scheme of things,'' said Phil Ryan, director of U.S. office research for the real estate firm \uc2 JLL\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Crypto and related companies are believed to occupy less than a million square feet of an estimated 4.4 billion square feet of office space in the United States. The numbers have grown quickly, though.\par \par \uc2 ''We've gone from essentially no companies focused on this in 2015 to about 835,000 square feet now,'' Mr. Ryan said, adding that leasing has jumped 68 percent since 2020.\par \par \uc2 Most web3 companies have gravitated to three locations in the United States: Silicon Valley, the tech hotbed where many companies get their start; New York, a growing tech hub and longtime financial center; and Miami, whose mayor, like New York's Eric Adams, has cheered on the sector by accepting his paycheck in cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 In upstate New York, data centers devoted to crypto mining -- the energy-guzzling process of verifying digital transactions -- have sprung up. These operations have faced pushback from environmental groups and public officials because the sites use electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels, threatening the state's effort to lower greenhouse gas emissions. The outcry has prompted the State Assembly to pass a bill that would place a moratorium on certain crypto mining operations.\par \par \uc2 In Manhattan, the cryptocurrency action is mostly centered on office space. \uc2 Savills\uc2 , a real estate brokerage firm, counts leases of more than 5,000 square feet for 30 notable \uc2 blockchain\uc2  companies around the borough, but an unknown number of firms occupy less space.\par \par \uc2 ''Companies are putting their toe in the water, establishing a physical presence and feeling out what having an office brings to the company,'' said Zev Holzman, an executive managing director of \uc2 Savills\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many web3 companies have been attracted to move-in-ready space that has allowed them to get up and running quickly. In January, \uc2 Cipher Mining\uc2  leased space at One Vanderbilt, \uc2 SL Green Realty\uc2 's new office building next to Grand Central Terminal. The lease was for 6,500 square feet of furnished space in Altus Suite, \uc2 SL Green\uc2 's in-house flex office brand.\par \par \uc2 But others are leasing and customizing their own spaces. The cryptocurrency exchange \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  is subletting 30,000 square feet in Hudson Yards after it became the first major crypto company in the United States to go public last year.\par \par \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 , a cryptocurrency data and transaction company, recently made a deal for about 77,000 square feet -- a significant amount of space in the crypto world -- at 114 Fifth Avenue. The company previously sublet about half that amount of space in the building but converted the deal into a direct lease and took possession of two additional floors.\par \par \uc2 ''The entire area around Union Square has become a crypto hub,'' said \uc2 Michael Gronager\uc2 , the company's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Interest is starting to creep north. The brokerage firm Adams & Company has a few crypto-related firms in its buildings on West 24th Street, including two that recently signed three-year leases, traditionally considered short term in commercial real estate.\par \par \uc2 ''These companies don't know how they're going to grow, and long term is not a risk they're necessarily willing to take,'' said James B. Buslik, a principal at the company.\par \par \uc2 Renting space to crypto companies is no different from renting to any other company, he added.\par \par \uc2 ''Anytime we have an offer from a tenant, we are evaluating them as to how they've performed to date and what the future looks like and the strength of their business,'' he said. ''I don't think we're looking at crypto or NFT any different than how we look at a mom-and-pop business.''\par \par \uc2 But in some cases, web3 is changing real estate. \uc2 WeWork\uc2 , for example, has been accepting cryptocurrency for rent payments since last year. And Jamestown, a real estate firm, recently announced a partnership with \uc2 BitPay\uc2  that will enable tenants to pay rent in cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 In March, Okada & Company, a family-owned real estate company, began offering an NFT to persuade brokers to help secure a tenant in a commercial building on West 24th Street. The incentive is for membership to a private dining club that bills itself as ''the world's first NFT restaurant.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's a way to embrace what's happening within the world of commerce and technology,'' said Christopher N. Okada, the company's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 At first, brokers seemed uninterested. ''Some were like, 'Can I just have the cash?''' he said. Then they began putting the NFT in letters of intent during negotiations.\par \par \uc2 Still, when Okada first offered the NFT, it was valued at about $12,000; it's now worth half that.\par \par \uc2 While his company seeks tenants for the building, it is also putting the property up for sale as an NFT -- essentially a ticket to acquire the deed.\par \par \uc2 Houses have been sold this way, but Mr. Okada, who is offering his building on OpenSea for $29.5 million or 15,105 Ether, the cryptocurrency that can be used to purchase the NFT, said he believed this was the first time a commercial building in New York had gone the same route.\par \par \uc2 Whether this is the wave of the future or a marketing gimmick remains to be seen, insiders say.\par \par \uc2 Solana, which took a 10-year lease at 141 East Houston, does not intend to fill up its new office with desk space for employees -- the company does not require daily appearances. Instead, it plans to build out the space for meetings and boot camps, known as hacker houses.\par \par \uc2 Solana also plans to occupy a floor at EmpireDAO, the new web3 co-working operation, at 190 Bowery, a six-story former bank with landmark status that was the longtime home of the photographer Jay Maisel. Solana is taking the floor meant for TerraUSD, a stablecoin that imploded this month.\par \par \uc2 EmpireDAO is envisioned as a sort of maker space for the web3 community. Its management system will be based on cryptocurrency, said Mike Fraietta, EmpireDAO's founder, but its landlord, RFR, requires rent payments the old-fashioned way.\par \par \uc2 ''Our lenders require U.S. dollars, we're making our mortgage payments in U.S. dollars, and that means our rents have to come in U.S. dollars,'' said AJ Camhi, director of leasing at RFR Realty.\par \par \uc2 Clockwise from top: Mike Fraietta, the founder of EmpireDAO, recently opened a co-working space for crypto entrepreneurs in Lower Manhattan; the landmark building has many original details; a developer's laptop at the co-working space; the six-story building is at 190 Bowery.; The EmpireDAO co-working space in the Bowery. Cryptocurrency firms have been leasing space in New York, often in edgier locations. EmpireDAO's management system is based on cryptocurrency, but its landlord requires rent in U.S. dollars.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Logan Paul had a message for his six million \uc2 Twitter\uc2  followers: He was ''all in'' on a new cryptocurrency called Dink Doink.\par \par \uc2 According to the project's creator, Dink Doink investors would receive shares of a cartoon character, entitling them to a portion of the proceeds if the googly-eyed figure ever appeared in a TV show or movie. Last June, Mr. Paul, a 27-year-old boxer and social-media influencer, praised Dink Doink on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and in a public Telegram chat, before endorsing it again on his podcast, ''Impaulsive.''\par \par \uc2 But by mid-July, the price of Dink Doink had plummeted to a fraction of a cent, and Mr. Paul was facing an online backlash. In his endorsements, he had failed to mention some relevant information: He and the project's creator were friends, and they had come up with the idea for the cryptocurrency together. He had also received a large allocation of Dink Doink coins when it launched.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know what went absurdly wrong,'' Mr. Paul said in an interview. ''That's the project from hell, and I just wiped my hands of that.''\par \par \uc2 The collapse in crypto prices this month has renewed scrutiny of the celebrity marketers who sell virtual currencies to the masses. Over the last year, the actor Matt Damon and the comedian Larry David have starred in high-profile TV commercials for crypto platforms, trumpeting digital assets as an unmissable moneymaking opportunity. Those ads drew criticism from crypto skeptics, but they were tied to mainstream companies with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.\par \par \uc2 A far seedier form of crypto promotion has flourished on social media, rife with undisclosed conflicts of interest and exaggerated claims about skyrocketing profits. Celebrity influencers like Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather have made millions of dollars endorsing specific and often dubious crypto investments, urging fans to buy obscure coins that quickly crashed in value, or shilling little-known collections of nonfungible tokens, the unique digital files known as NFTs.\par \par \uc2 In some cases, promoters like Mr. Paul have admitted that they failed to disclose personal or financial ties to projects advertised on their feeds, a potential violation of federal marketing regulations. And even before the crypto market's recent downturn, a series of these influencer-backed ventures had crashed spectacularly, hurting amateur traders and prompting lawsuits that could force some celebrities to compensate investors for their losses.\par \par \uc2 ''You have this shameless profiteering from celebrities and others, who aren't at all disinterested or impartial,'' said John Reed Stark, a former chief of the internet enforcement branch at the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . ''There is a lot of potential for harm.''\par \par \uc2 Crypto entrepreneurs hire influencers to push up the value of their digital currencies, hoping to ignite the sort of online hype that briefly turned Dogecoin, a joke currency based on a meme, into one of the most valuable crypto investments.\par \par \uc2 Some promoters are not well known outside crypto circles but have large followings on social media, where they broadcast market tips, interspersed with sponsored content. Others are major celebrities like Ms. Kardashian, who is facing a lawsuit from investors over her marketing of an obscure cryptocurrency called EthereumMax.\par \par \uc2 The amounts paid to crypto promoters can be astronomical. An NFT project called Hive Investments has been recruiting influencers, offering payments as large as $400,000, according to a presentation reviewed by \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Jordan Belfort, the former stockbroker whose memoir inspired the 2013 movie ''The Wolf of Wall Street,'' was once offered $250,000 to change his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  profile picture to an NFT. Mr. Belfort, who recently rebranded himself as a crypto guru, turned down the offer.\par \par \uc2 ''We don't want to be a part of things that basically exist purely to separate people from their money,'' said Matt Hirschberg, Mr. Belfort's business partner. ''I've had people offer us guarantees of up to at least $10 million just to get involved.''\par \par \uc2 Crypto promotion occupies a legal gray area. Under federal law, people marketing securities are required to publicly disclose payments for promotions. In 2018, Mr. Mayweather paid more than $600,000 to settle S.E.C. charges that he had failed to properly disclose his compensation for marketing initial coin offerings, the crypto equivalent of an initial public offering on Wall Street. But the rule he broke applies only to securities, like stock in a company, and it is unclear which crypto products meet that legal standard.\par \par \uc2 Crypto promoters could also run afoul of the \uc2 Federal Trade Commission\uc2 's rules, which require marketers of all kinds to disclose when they have a financial stake in the projects they endorse.\par \par \uc2 ''Companies and the social media influencers of the world view this as the Wild West,'' said David Klein, a lawyer in New York who specializes in marketing rules. ''The old-world laws still apply, and you have to follow the guidelines. Otherwise, the regulators will come calling.''\par \par \uc2 Even celebrities who disclose crypto payments have found themselves in legal trouble. Last summer, Ms. Kardashian endorsed EthereumMax in an \uc2 Instagram\uc2  post with a brief disclaimer at the bottom: ''#ad.'' Few crypto insiders had heard of EthereumMax, which is different from Ethereum, one of the most popular crypto platforms.\par \par \uc2 The promotion led to a surge of trading, but EthereumMax's price soon collapsed. This year, nine traders who had bought EthereumMax sued Ms. Kardashian, the project's founders and other promoters, including Mr. Mayweather and the former basketball star Paul Pierce, accusing them of disguising their control over EthereumMax tokens and circulating ''misleading'' advertisements.\par \par \uc2 According to the lawsuit, Mr. Pierce received more than 15 trillion EthereumMax tokens in exchange for tweets endorsing the coin. None of the tweets excerpted in the lawsuit mentioned a business relationship with the token's creators. Shortly after promoting the project, the lawsuit claimed, Mr. Pierce sold his tokens -- an apparent ''pump and dump'' operation in which he profited by encouraging fans to buy the tokens, before selling his own holdings at a higher price.\par \par \uc2 A lawyer for Ms. Kardashian said the suit's allegations ''lack merit.'' Mr. Mayweather, Mr. Pierce and the project's founders did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 As crypto prices have crashed, investors have also turned on lower-profile influencers who post sponsored content on social media. Ben Armstrong, a crypto influencer with almost one million \uc2 Twitter\uc2  followers, runs a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  channel where he discusses market trends and talks up his favorite projects. He used to charge start-up founders $40,000 for a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  interview, but discontinued the service this year after his price sheet was posted publicly by an influential crypto sleuth.\par \par \uc2 Some of the projects that Mr. Armstrong promoted were small-time, experimental crypto ventures that eventually encountered problems. In those cases, he said, he considered himself a victim, too.\par \par \uc2 ''They're preying on the novice crypto influencer who just got popular and is trying to figure out what they should and shouldn't be doing,'' he said. ''It's hard to go from 12,000 followers to a million in one year and make all the right decisions.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul rose to fame as a video blogger and an occasional actor; \uc2 YouTube\uc2  once reprimanded him for publishing footage of a dead body he found in a Japanese forest. Over the years, he has parlayed his internet fame into an eclectic array of entrepreneurial pursuits, including a line of energy drinks.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul became interested in crypto last year as the market for NFTs started booming. In a recent interview, he acknowledged that he was still learning how to navigate the crypto market, even as he tried to profit from the technology. ''I'm an extreme ideas person, not much of an executor,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul was involved in some of the initial brainstorming for the Dink Doink project. But the venture was ultimately spearheaded by one of his roommates, Jake Broido, who gave Mr. Paul 2.5 percent of the tokens that were initially issued.\par \par \uc2 In a tweet last June, Mr. Paul called it one of the ''dumbest, most ridiculous'' cryptocurrencies he had encountered, and circulated a video of a cartoon character singing sexually explicit lyrics. ''That's why I'm all in,'' he added. He also appeared in a shaky-cam video on Telegram in which he hailed Dink Doink as possibly his favorite crypto investment.\par \par \uc2 The campaign was a flop, and Mr. Paul was pilloried by \uc2 YouTube\uc2  critics. The price of Dink Doink hovered well below a cent, before falling even further in value over the summer. Mr. Paul said he had never sold his tokens or profited from the project. But he said he regretted promoting the coin without disclosing his financial stake. ''I definitely didn't act as responsibly as I should have,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Not long after Dink Doink's crash, Mr. Paul started an NFT collection called CryptoZoo, which was widely mocked for featuring stock images of animals. Mr. Paul blamed the staff who helped run the project for CryptoZoo's problems. Now, he's working with a new team on a crypto venture called Liquid Marketplace, which uses \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology to let investors buy fractions of physical objects.\par \par \uc2 The recent crypto crash ''will definitely weed out the weak,'' Mr. Paul said. But he added that it had also made him rethink some of his promotions, after he personally lost $750,000.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want anyone to feel like they've been screwed because of any sort of move they've made because of me,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Paul knows what it feels like to be on the receiving end of a deal gone sour. Last year, he fought Mr. Mayweather in a Las Vegas boxing exhibition that drew more than one million pay-per-view customers. Months later, Mr. Paul claimed that Mr. Mayweather still hadn't fully compensated him for the fight. (Mr. Mayweather responded: ''Be happy with the biggest payday you ever got in your life.'')\par \par \uc2 The event itself was a cryptocurrency promotion: Fans were encouraged to buy tickets using EthereumMax.\par \par \uc2 Kitty Bennett contributed research.\par \par \uc2 Kitty Bennett contributed research.\par \par \uc2 Logan Paul, center, a boxer and influencer, didn't mention his stake in Dink Doink when he promoted it.

\par\par \uc2 PAUL KRUGMAN\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Is Crypto Facing the Music?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Paul Krugman \par \uc2 1,147 \uc2 words\par \uc2 22 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Last week TerraUSD, a stablecoin -- a system that was supposed to perform a lot like a conventional bank account but was backed only by a cryptocurrency called Luna -- collapsed. Luna lost 97 percent of its value over the course of just 24 hours, apparently destroying some investors' life savings.\par \par \uc2 The event shook the crypto world in general, but the truth is that this world was looking pretty shaky even before the Terra disaster. Bitcoin, the original cryptocurrency, peaked last November and has since declined by more than 50 percent.\par \par \uc2 Here's one way to think about that decline. Almost everyone is concerned about the rising cost of living; the Consumer Price Index -- the cost of a representative basket of goods and services -- has gone up about 4 percent over the past six months. But the cost of the same basket in Bitcoin has risen around 120 percent, which means inflation at an annualized rate of about 380 percent.\par \par \uc2 And other cryptocurrencies have performed far worse. Two cities -- Miami and New York -- have introduced their own cryptocurrencies, with enthusiastic support from their mayors. MiamiCoin is down more than 90 percent from its peak, and NewYorkCityCoin is down more than 80 percent.\par \par \uc2 By now, we've all heard of them, but what exactly are cryptocurrencies? Many people -- including, I fear, many people who have invested in them -- probably still don't fully understand them. Saying that they're digital assets doesn't really get at it. My bank account, which I mainly reach online, is also a digital asset, for all practical purposes.\par \par \uc2 What's distinctive about cryptocurrencies is how ownership is established. I own the money in my bank account because the law says I do, and the bank enforces that legal claim by requiring, one way or another, that I prove that I am, in fact, me. Ownership of a crypto asset is established through what's known as the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , an encrypted (hence the name) digital record of all previous transfers of ownership that supposedly obviates the need for an external party, such as a bank, to validate a claim.\par \par \uc2 What's the point of this kind of decentralized finance, and what purpose does it serve? Well, I'll get to all that.\par \par \uc2 Though cryptocurrencies are currently way down, boosters -- and as anyone who's played in this space can tell you, there are few boosters quite as boosterish -- will reassure you that this has happened before. Bitcoin, in particular, has always bounced back from previous dips, and investors who HODLed (held on for dear life to their coins, despite falling prices) have ended up with huge capital gains. But there are reasons to believe that this time may be different.\par \par \uc2 In the past, cryptocurrencies kept going up by attracting an ever-growing range of investors. Crypto was once held by a small clique that often had the feel of a cult, motivated in part by a combination of libertarian ideology and fascination with the clever use of technology. Over time, rising crypto prices drew in large numbers of additional investors and some big Wall Street money.\par \par \uc2 And in the past year or so, crypto marketing has gone really mainstream, with endorsements from celebrities -- including Matt Damon, Kim Kardashian and Mike Tyson -- not to mention political figures like Mayor Eric Adams of New York and the (unsuccessful) Republican Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who declared his intention to make Ohio ''pro-God, pro-family, pro-Bitcoin.'' Given all this, it's hard to see who else there might be to recruit into crypto investing.\par \par \uc2 One disturbing aspect of this marketing push, by the way, is that those who bought cryptocurrencies relatively recently -- and have therefore lost a lot of money in the crypto crash -- probably consist disproportionately of the kind of people most likely to be influenced by celebrity endorsements. That is, they are probably poorer and less sophisticated than the average investor and badly positioned to handle the losses they've taken over the past few months.\par \par \uc2 In any case, as we look forward, the value of cryptocurrencies will have to rest on their underlying economic uses, which are ...\par \par \uc2 Well, that's just the thing. I've heard many discussions in which crypto supporters have been asked exactly what economic role crypto can play that isn't more easily and cheaply achieved through other means -- debit cards, Venmo, etc. Other than illegal transactions, in which crypto may sometimes offer anonymity, I have yet to hear a coherent answer.\par \par \uc2 As it is, cryptocurrencies play almost no role in economic transactions other than speculation in crypto markets themselves. And if your answer is ''give it time,'' you should bear in mind that Bitcoin has been around since 2009, which makes it ancient by tech standards; \uc2 Apple\uc2  introduced the iPad in 2010. If crypto was going to replace conventional money as a medium of exchange -- a means of payment -- surely we should have seen some signs of that happening by now. Just try paying for your groceries or other everyday goods using Bitcoin. It's nearly impossible.\par \par \uc2 And then there's El Salvador, which tried to force the process by making Bitcoin legal tender and heavily promoting and subsidizing its use, in an attempt to make it a true medium of exchange. All indications are that the experiment has been an abject failure.\par \par \uc2 But can crypto really have become such a big deal without any clear economic rationale other than pure speculation? Can it really be just a bubble inflated by FOMO, fear of missing out? Those who question crypto's purpose are constantly confronted with the argument that the sheer scale of the industry -- at their peak, crypto assets were worth almost $3 trillion -- and the amount of money true believers have made along the way proves the skeptics wrong. Can we, the public, really be that foolish and gullible?\par \par \uc2 Well, maybe the crypto skeptics are wrong. But on the question of folly and gullibility, the answer is yes, we can.\par \par \uc2 Quick Hits\par \par \uc2 El Salvador's Bitcoin experiment may cause a debt crisis.\par \par \uc2 Which is why the \uc2 International Monetary Fund\uc2  urged the country to call the whole thing off.\par \par \uc2 A different kind of crypto crisis in, of all places, Kazakhstan.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin mining is getting banned around the world.\par \par \uc2 We want to hear from you.\par \par \uc2 Tell us about your experience with this newsletter by answering this short survey.\par \par \uc2 Facing the Music\par \par \uc2 Not the Eurovision winners, but a great band from Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 Feedback\par \par \uc2 If you're enjoying what you're reading, please consider recommending it to friends.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Trash Talk Can't Save Crypto Fund\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany and Erin Griffith \par \uc2 1,748 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Do Kwon, a South Korean entrepreneur, hyped the Luna and TerraUSD cryptocurrencies. Their failures have devastated some traders, though not the investment firms that cashed out early.\par \par \uc2 Do Kwon, a trash-talking entrepreneur from South Korea, called the cryptocurrency he created in 2018 ''my greatest invention.'' In countless tweets and interviews, he trumpeted the world-changing potential of the currency, Luna, rallying a band of investors and supporters he proudly referred to as ''Lunatics.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kwon's company, Terraform Labs, raised more than $200 million from investment firms such as \uc2 Lightspeed Venture Partners\uc2  and \uc2 Galaxy Digital\uc2  to fund crypto projects built with the currency, even as critics questioned its technological underpinnings. Luna's total value ballooned to more than $40 billion, creating a frenzy of excitement that swept up day traders and start-up founders, as well as wealthy investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kwon dismissed concerns with a taunt: ''I don't debate the poor.''\par \par \uc2 But last week, Luna and another currency that Mr. Kwon developed, TerraUSD, suffered a spectacular collapse. Their meltdowns had a domino effect on the rest of the cryptocurrency market, tanking the price of Bitcoin and accelerating the loss of $300 billion in value across the crypto economy. This week, the price of Luna remained close to zero, while TerraUSD continued to slide.\par \par \uc2 The downfall of Luna and TerraUSD offers a case study in crypto hype and who is left holding the bag when it all comes crashing down. Mr. Kwon's rise was enabled by respected financiers who were willing to back highly speculative financial products. Some of those investors sold their Luna and TerraUSD coins early, reaping substantial profits, while retail traders now grapple with devastating losses.\par \par \uc2 Pantera Capital, a hedge fund that invested in Mr. Kwon's efforts, made a profit of about 100 times its initial investment, after selling roughly 80 percent of its holdings of Luna over the last year, said Paul Veradittakit, an investor at the firm.\par \par \uc2 Pantera turned $1.7 million into around $170 million. The recent crash was ''unfortunate,'' Mr. Veradittakit said. ''A lot of retail investors have lost money. I'm sure a lot of institutional investors have, too.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kwon did not respond to messages. Most of his other investors declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Kathleen Breitman, a founder of the crypto platform Tezos, said the rise and fall of Luna and TerraUSD were driven by the irresponsible behavior of the institutions backing Mr. Kwon. ''You've seen a bunch of people trying to trade in their reputations to make quick bucks,'' she said. Now, she said, ''they're trying to console people who are seeing their life savings slip out from underneath them. There's no defense for that.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kwon, a 30-year-old graduate of \uc2 Stanford University\uc2 , founded Terraform Labs in 2018 after stints as a software engineer at \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  and \uc2 Apple\uc2 . (He had a partner, Daniel Shin, who later left the company.) His company claimed it was creating a ''modern financial system'' in which users could conduct complicated transactions without relying on banks or other middlemen.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Shin and Mr. Kwon began marketing the Luna currency in 2018. In 2020, Terraform started offering TerraUSD, which is known as a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to serve as a reliable means of exchange. Stablecoins are typically pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar and are not supposed to fluctuate in value like other cryptocurrencies. Traders often use stablecoins to buy and sell other riskier assets.\par \par \uc2 But TerraUSD was risky even by the standards of experimental crypto technology. Unlike the popular stablecoin Tether, it was not backed by cash, treasuries or other traditional assets. Instead, it derived its supposed stability from algorithms that linked its value to Luna. Mr. Kwon used the two related coins as the basis for more elaborate borrowing and lending projects in the murky world of decentralized finance, or DeFi.\par \par \uc2 From the beginning, crypto experts were skeptical that an algorithm would keep Mr. Kwon's twin cryptocurrencies stable. In 2018, a white paper outlining the stablecoin proposal reached the desk of Cyrus Younessi, an analyst for the crypto investment firm Scalar Capital. Mr. Younessi sent a note to his boss, explaining that the project could enter a ''death spiral'' in which a crash in Luna's price would bring the stablecoin down with it.\par \par \uc2 ''I was like, 'This is crazy,''' he said in an interview. ''This obviously doesn't work.''\par \par \uc2 As Luna caught on, the naysayers grew louder. Charles Cascarilla, a founder of Paxos, a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company that offers a competing stablecoin, cast doubt on Luna's underlying technology in an interview last year. (Mr. Kwon responded by taunting him on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''Wtf is Paxos.'') Kevin Zhou, a hedge fund manager, repeatedly predicted that the two currencies would crash.\par \par \uc2 But venture investment came pouring in anyway to fund projects built on Luna's underlying technology, like services for people to exchange cryptocurrencies or borrow and lend TerraUSD. Investors including Arrington Capital and Coinbase Ventures shoveled in more than $200 million between 2018 and 2021, according to PitchBook, which tracks funding.\par \par \uc2 In April, Luna's price rose to a peak of $116 from less than $1 in early 2021, minting a generation of crypto millionaires. A community of retail traders formed around the coin, hailing Mr. Kwon as a cult hero. \uc2 Mike Novogratz\uc2 , chief executive of \uc2 Galaxy Digital\uc2 , which invested in Terraform Labs, announced his support by getting a Luna-themed tattoo.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Kwon, who operates out of South Korea and Singapore, gloated on social media. In April, he announced that he had named his newborn daughter Luna, tweeting, ''My dearest creation named after my greatest invention.''\par \par \uc2 ''It's the cult of personality -- the bombastic, arrogant, Do Kwon attitude -- that sucks people in,'' said Brad Nickel, who hosts the cryptocurrency podcast ''Mission: DeFi.''\par \par \uc2 Earlier this year, a nonprofit that Mr. Kwon also runs sold $1 billion of Luna to investors, using the proceeds to buy a stockpile of Bitcoin -- a reserve designed to keep the price of TerraUSD stable if the markets ever dipped.\par \par \uc2 Around the same time, some of the venture capital firms that had backed Mr. Kwon started to have concerns. Hack VC, a venture firm focused on crypto, sold its Luna tokens in December, partly because ''we felt the market was due for a broader pullback,'' said Ed Roman, a managing director at the firm.\par \par \uc2 Martin Baumann, a founder of the Hong Kong-based venture firm CMCC Global, said his company sold its holdings in March, at about $100 per coin. ''We had gotten increasing concerns,'' he said in an email, ''both from tech side as well as regulatory side.'' (CMCC and Hack VC declined to comment on their profits.)\par \par \uc2 Even Mr. Kwon alluded to the possibility of a crypto collapse, publicly joking that some crypto ventures might ultimately go under. He said he found it ''entertaining'' to watch companies crumble.\par \par \uc2 Last week, falling crypto prices and challenging economic trends combined to create a panic in the markets. The price of Luna fell to nearly zero. As critics had predicted, the price of TerraUSD crashed in tandem, dropping from its $1 peg to as low as 11 cents this week. In a matter of days, the crypto ecosystem Mr. Kwon had built was essentially worthless.\par \par \uc2 ''I am heartbroken about the pain my invention has brought on all of you,'' he tweeted last week.\par \par \uc2 Some of Mr. Kwon's major investors have lost money. \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2 , chief executive of the crypto exchange \uc2 Binance\uc2 , which invested in Terraform Labs, said his firm had bought $3 million of Luna, which grew to a peak value of $1.6 billion. But \uc2 Binance\uc2  never sold its tokens. Its Luna holdings are currently worth less than $3,000.\par \par \uc2 That loss is still only a drop in the bucket for a company as large as \uc2 Binance\uc2 , whose U.S. arm is valued at $4.5 billion.\par \par \uc2 ''Most of the V.C.s have the analysts they need to assess these things,'' Mr. Nickel said. ''They may have figured they could cash out on the backs of retail.''\par \par \uc2 Much of the pain of the collapse has instead been felt by regular traders. On a Reddit forum for Luna evangelists, users shared lists of suicide hotlines, as people who had poured their savings into Luna or TerraUSD expressed despair.\par \par \uc2 The crash has also devastated the enthusiasts who were building start-ups that used the crypto infrastructure developed by Mr. Kwon.\par \par \uc2 Neel Somani, 24, quit his job as a quantitative researcher at \uc2 Citadel\uc2 , a hedge fund, in February to work on a project that connected Luna's underlying \uc2 blockchain\uc2  to Ethereum, another crypto system.\par \par \uc2 In April, Mr. Somani joined Terra Hacker House, a monthlong program in a Chicago office sponsored by Terraform Labs and its investors, designed to incubate projects built on Mr. Kwon's technology. Within a few weeks, Mr. Somani lined up $10 million in commitments for venture funding that valued his project, Terranova, at $65 million. He was close to hiring three employees, he said, and had 40 customers excited about the idea.\par \par \uc2 After Luna and TerraUSD tumbled, Mr. Somani and his fellow hackers initially thought Mr. Kwon and his partners could turn things around. But by last Tuesday, Mr. Somani realized it was over, and felt relieved he hadn't yet accepted the funding. He lost around $20,000 of Luna, he said, which didn't bother him since he has made money on other risky stock and crypto bets.\par \par \uc2 Over the last week, the desks at the hacker house have emptied. A Telegram group called Rebuilding Terra, with nearly 200 members, has been actively discussing how to salvage projects and funds.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Somani is sanguine. ''For those of us who are crypto builders, the feast and famine mentality comes really naturally, and that's maybe what attracted us to the community,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, he plans to pitch his now-obsolete technology at the hacker house's demo day. Most other groups have left the program, he said, so he expects less competition for a $50,000 first-place prize.\par \par \uc2 ''It's in U.S. dollars,'' he said. ''I asked.''\par \par \uc2 Kirsten Noyes contributed research.\par \par \uc2 Kirsten Noyes contributed research.\par \par \uc2 Before the cryptocurrency he created collapsed, Do Kwon dismissed critics this way: ''I don't debate the poor.''

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Weighing Cryptocurrency's Role in Abortion Access\b0\par\par\uc2 By Anna P. Kambhampaty, Alisha Haridasani Gupta and Valeriya Safronova \par \uc2 1,878 \uc2 words\par \uc2 15 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the loud and confusing world of cryptocurrencies, fund-raising efforts are forming around all sorts of causes. Groups known as decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs, have sent aid to Ukrainians whose lives have been upended by war, worked to offset carbon emissions, bought land and collected NFTs.\par \par \uc2 Now, after the leak of a Supreme Court draft opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade, entrepreneurs and activists are floating ideas for an abortion-focused DAO. They see it as a way to provide money to women in more than two dozen states where abortion services may soon be severely restricted or banned -- a kind of ''Underground Railroad for abortion,'' as \uc2 Reshma Saujani\uc2 , the founder of \uc2 Girls Who Code\uc2  and a host of the ''De-Broing Crypto'' podcast, put it in an interview.\par \par \uc2 The hubris of crypto idealists often draws the ire of critics on the internet, and with good reason. Boosters have promoted \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology as a solution to just about every global problem, while at the same time cryptocurrency has created plenty of new ones -- regulatory, environmental and otherwise -- and helped some of the wealthiest people grow even richer.\par \par \uc2 And though many crypto enthusiasts dangle the lure of anonymity -- an especially salient issue if Roe is overturned -- because of the precision with which the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  traces transactions, paying for abortions using crypto could potentially have the opposite effect: exposing both the women getting abortions and the people paying for them. Not to mention that the crypto market just went through a major crash and regularly experiences wild price fluctuations.\par \par \uc2 Still, abortion rights activists and nonprofit leaders see a fund-raising opportunity. (Several anti-abortion groups already accept cryptocurrency donations.)\par \par \uc2 Here's how they think an abortion rights DAO would work: Members would pool funds that would be used to pay for out-of-state travel, in-clinic procedures and the pills that account for 54 percent of abortions in the United States. Grass-roots abortion funds have been doing similar work for decades, and multinational corporations such as \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and \uc2 Citigroup\uc2  have agreed to help employees cover travel costs. (In many states, there could soon be legal consequences for financially facilitating abortions.) DAOs have raised huge sums of digital currencies in short periods of time; abortion rights groups are in a rush to do just that.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Giovannina Anthony, an OB-GYN, feels the urgency acutely. She works at a small practice in Jackson, Wyo. -- the only office in the state that provides abortions. If Roe is overturned, a trigger law will effectively ban all abortions in the state. Should that happen, she said, providers and women seeking abortions will confront new hurdles and costs.\par \par \uc2 ''They're going to have to try and find child care. They're going to risk losing their jobs. They're going to have to pay for super-expensive gas,'' Dr. Anthony said. ''We're in uncharted territory.''\par \par \uc2 Given the challenges of crypto, what may be most exciting about its role in the abortion debate -- on both sides -- is the problem fund-raisers have always faced: how to raise money quickly.\par \par \uc2 Crypto for a Cause\par \par \uc2 Last year, thousands of people raised more than $40 million in Ether, a top cryptocurrency, through a DAO in just a week with the hope of buying a first printing of the United States Constitution. Then the DAO lost the auction to \uc2 Ken Griffin\uc2 , the billionaire founder of the hedge fund \uc2 Citadel\uc2 , and the group began to dissolve.\par \par \uc2 Jonah Erlich, a core contributor, still thinks ConstitutionDAO was a valuable experiment. ''The speed at which we were able to move, as well as how many people were able to contribute, was a big success,'' he said. (Refunding contributors has been much harder; the group had to cover the high transaction fees associated with the Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , so it's working with less money than it raised. ''That is a problem that's still being worked on,'' Mr. Erlich said.)\par \par \uc2 Separately, UkraineDAO, organized in part by Nadya Tolokonnikova of Pussy Riot, raised more than $7 million in a few days by selling an NFT of a Ukrainian flag. In March, President \uc2 Volodymyr Zelensky\uc2  signed into law a bill legalizing cryptocurrency exchanges in the country. As of that month, according to Alex Bornyakov, Ukraine's deputy minister of digital transformation, the country had received nearly $100 million in crypto donations.\par \par \uc2 But these are isolated examples in what remains for many an impenetrable sphere of finance. Only 16 percent of Americans have experience with cryptocurrencies -- through investing, trading or paying for things -- according to a recent Pew survey, and more than half of them are men. Affluent men. Those demographics can mean that the fanciful projects some crypto entrepreneurs have proposed don't always reflect public interests, and can seem driven by impulse.\par \par \uc2 ''Anytime there's a problem, people say that crypto or web3 is going to be the solution without putting much thought into it,'' said Molly White, a software developer who has been archiving crypto crashes and missteps on a website called Web3 Is Going Just Great.\par \par \uc2 Ms. White pointed to the crypto project Nemus, which aims to raise funds for the \uc2 Amazon\uc2  rainforest. ''People are talking about protecting portions of the \uc2 Amazon\uc2  rainforest, but they're using blockchains that are very damaging to the environment,'' she said, referring to the energy-intensive process of putting cryptocurrencies into circulation. ''It's like they don't see the damage they're doing with the solutions that they're proposing.''\par \par \uc2 There have been attempts to make crypto donations more accessible to charitable organizations. Change, a company that sells an interface for web donations, recently created a nonprofit arm that manages crypto wallets for charitable organizations. The point is to avoid ''putting the daunting security, technical and accounting burden on them,'' said Sonia Nigam, the chief executive of Change. Donations are paid out to those organizations -- including \uc2 Girls Who Code\uc2 , \uc2 Make-a-Wish Foundation\uc2  and One Tree Planted -- in the form of grants.\par \par \uc2 Most national abortion nonprofits and health care providers still do not accept cryptocurrency. Elliott Kozuch, a senior communications strategist at the nonprofit \uc2 NARAL Pro-Choice America\uc2 , wrote in an email that ''crypto has not come up in conversation at NARAL, including in relation to the SCOTUS leak.''\par \par \uc2 But there could be a shift coming. Elissa Maercklein, the chief executive of Crypto Chicks, an NFT collective, said that the organization made a donation of 5 Ether (worth more than $15,000 at the time, and around $10,000 as of Friday) to the \uc2 International Planned Parenthood Federation\uc2  in February; it was the first crypto donation the organization accepted.\par \par \uc2 ''When I contacted them, they were a bit surprised, but excited to learn more,'' Ms. Maercklein said. She has worked with I.P.P.F. to ensure the organization will accept crypto donations moving forward through a platform called the Giving Block. The platform also enables several anti-abortion groups, including \uc2 Alliance Defending Freedom\uc2 , National Right to Life and Students for Life of America, to accept donations in cryptocurrencies.\par \par \uc2 ''We offer nonprofits the ability to protect donor privacy by allowing anonymous donations,'' Alex Wilson, a founder of the Giving Block, wrote in an email. ''This has become popular for human rights organizations where donors might not otherwise give for fear of retaliation or targeting based on a cause they support.''\par \par \uc2 The Privacy Question\par \par \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  technology, which underpins every cryptocurrency exchange, produces a public ledger where all transactions are recorded. If that's the case, is crypto really more private than other payments?\par \par \uc2 It can be. Monero and Zcash, for instance, are known as ''privacy coins.'' Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, Monero's public ledger doesn't show addresses or amounts for each transaction, making it harder to identify how funds are moving.\par \par \uc2 Justin Ehrenhofer, the vice president for operations at Cake Wallet, which allows people to store Monero, said that the currency could be used to discreetly buy abortion pills in cases in which that may become illegal. (Right now, he said, common uses include black market purchases and ransomware payments.) But he noted that using Monero requires more technical expertise than Bitcoin or Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 In part because of the Silk Road, a digital black market where thousands of vendors sold drugs and other illegal goods from 2011 to 2013, cryptocurrency is often thought of as a way to make private payments. But Sarah Meiklejohn, a professor of cryptography and security at \uc2 University College London\uc2 , said that most digital currency payments were fairly traceable.\par \par \uc2 ''The transactions that you make are less inherently tied to your name,'' Professor Meiklejohn said, because people typically use pseudonyms, but they are visible to everyone on a digital ledger. ''Literally anyone in the world can go look at the transactions that are taking place.''\par \par \uc2 Pseudonyms, she said, ''provide a really thin level of anonymity.'' \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2 , which has become the \uc2 U.S. government\uc2 's \uc2 blockchain\uc2  surveillance partner of choice, can identify patterns in transactions made through certain wallets, though a company representative said in an email that \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2  aims to protect individual privacy. Likewise, \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , one of the more mainstream cryptocurrency exchanges, states on its website that it maintains records of transactions and may report some to law enforcement.\par \par \uc2 ''With privacy, it's like, once it's out, it's out,'' Professor Meiklejohn said.\par \par \uc2 Dr. Rebecca Gomperts, a physician and the director of \uc2 Women on Waves\uc2 , a nonprofit that provides resources for abortion seekers, found this to be the case when she tried setting up her own crypto wallet. ''It had exactly the same diligence requests as a normal bank account, where you have to provide IDs and other information,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 She could see how anonymous transactions might appeal to abortion providers, whose work could soon turn them into legal targets. But, she said, ''I haven't found a cryptocurrency where you can do that.''\par \par \uc2 Legal scholars are not convinced that cryptocurrencies would shield patients in most cases. Abortion bans ''will cover everything, whether you pay with cash or crypto,'' said Rachel Rebouch\u233\'00\'E9, the interim dean at the Temple University Beasley School of Law and an author of a forthcoming paper called ''The New Abortion Battleground.''\par \par \uc2 ''If abortion is illegal in your state -- it doesn't matter whether you get a surgical abortion, a medication abortion, whether you self-manage your abortion -- if it's illegal, it's illegal,'' said Kimberly Mutcherson, a dean and professor of law at Rutgers Law School who has focused on reproductive rights. (In the first three months of this year, 22 states introduced more than 100 restrictions on abortion pills approved by the \uc2 Food and Drug Administration\uc2 , according to the \uc2 Guttmacher Institute\uc2 , a reproductive health research group that supports abortion rights.)\par \par \uc2 Still, organizations like \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  are keeping an open mind about how they might raise and distribute funds.\par \par \uc2 Alexis McGill Johnson\uc2 , the organization's president and chief executive, said \uc2 Planned Parenthood\uc2  was ''looking into a number of things'' in the realm of cryptocurrencies but would not divulge details.\par \par \uc2 ''The bottom line is all of the options are on the table,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Mark Pernice FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220515ei5f0005e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 As Cryptocurrencies Melt Down, $300 Billion Evaporates in Days\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany, Erin Griffith and Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 1,430 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A steep sell-off that gained momentum this week starkly illustrated the risks of the experimental and unregulated digital currencies.\par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO -- The price of Bitcoin plunged to its lowest point since 2020. \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , the large cryptocurrency exchange, tanked in value. A cryptocurrency that promoted itself as a stable means of exchange collapsed. And more than $300 billion was wiped out by a crash in cryptocurrency prices since Monday.\par \par \uc2 The crypto world went into a full meltdown this week in a sell-off that graphically illustrated the risks of the experimental and unregulated digital currencies. Even as celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and tech moguls like \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  have talked up crypto, the accelerating declines of virtual currencies like Bitcoin and Ether show that, in some cases, two years of financial gains can disappear overnight.\par \par \uc2 The moment of panic amounted to the worst reset in cryptocurrencies since Bitcoin plummeted 80 percent in 2018. But this time, the falling prices have broader impact because more people and institutions hold the currencies. Critics said the collapse was long overdue, while some traders compared the alarm and fear to the start of the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 ''This is like the perfect storm,'' said \uc2 Dan Dolev\uc2 , an analyst who covers crypto companies and financial technology at the Mizuho Group.\par \par \uc2 During the coronavirus pandemic, people have flooded into virtual currencies, with 16 percent of Americans now owning some, up from 1 percent in 2015, according to a \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  survey. Big banks like Northern Trust and Bank of America also streamed in, along with hedge funds, some using debt to further juice their crypto bets.\par \par \uc2 Early investors are still probably in a comfortable position. But the rapid declines this week have been especially acute for investors who bought cryptocurrencies when prices surged last year.\par \par \uc2 The fall in cryptocurrencies is part of a broader pullback from risky assets, spurred by rising interest rates, inflation and economic uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Those factors have compounded a so-called pandemic hangover that began as life started returning to normal in the United States, hurting the stock prices of companies like Zoom and \uc2 Netflix\uc2  that thrived during lockdowns.\par \par \uc2 But crypto's decline is more severe than the broader plunge in the stock market. While the S&P 500 is down 18 percent so far this year, Bitcoin's price has dropped 40 percent in the same period. In the last five days alone, Bitcoin has tumbled 20 percent, compared to a 5 percent decline in the S&P 500.\par \par \uc2 How long crypto's collapse might last is unclear. Cryptocurrency prices have typically rebounded from major losses, though in some cases it took several years to reach new heights.\par \par \uc2 ''It's hard to say, 'Is this \uc2 Lehman Brothers\uc2 ?''' said \uc2 Charles Cascarilla\uc2 , a founder of the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company Paxos, referring to the financial services firm that went bankrupt at the start of the 2008 financial crisis. ''We're going to need some more time to figure it out. You can't respond at this type of speed.''\par \par \uc2 The origins of cryptocurrencies trace back to 2008, when a shadowy figure calling himself \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  created Bitcoin. The virtual currency was portrayed as a decentralized alternative to the traditional financial system. Rather than relying on gatekeepers like banks to facilitate commerce, Bitcoin proponents preferred to conduct transactions among themselves, recording each one on a shared ledger called a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Prominent tech leaders including Mr. Musk, \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , a founder of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , and \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2 , an investor, embraced the technology as it grew from a novel curiosity into a cultlike movement. The value of cryptocurrencies exploded, minting a new class of crypto billionaires. Other forms of cryptocurrency, including Ether and Dogecoin, captured the public's attention, particularly in the pandemic, when excess cash in the financial system led people to day trade for entertainment.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency prices reached a peak late last year and have since slid as fears over the economy grew. But the meltdown gathered momentum this week when TerraUSD, a stablecoin, imploded. Stablecoins, which are meant to be a more reliable means of exchange, are typically pegged to a stable asset such as the U.S. dollar and are intended not to fluctuate in value. Many traders use them to buy other cryptocurrencies.\par \par \uc2 TerraUSD had the backing of credible venture capital firms, including Arrington Capital and \uc2 Lightspeed Venture Partners\uc2 , which invested tens of millions of dollars to fund crypto projects built on the currency. That gave ''a false sense of security to people who might not otherwise know about these things,'' said Kathleen Breitman, one of the founders of Tezos, a crypto platform.\par \par \uc2 But TerraUSD was not backed by cash, treasuries or other traditional assets. Instead, it derived its supposed stability from algorithms that linked its value to a sister cryptocurrency called Luna.\par \par \uc2 This week, Luna lost almost its entire value. That immediately had a knock-on effect on TerraUSD, which fell to a low of 23 cents on Wednesday. As investors panicked, Tether, the most popular stablecoin and a linchpin of crypto trading, also wavered from its own $1 peg. Tether fell as low as $0.95 before recovering. (Tether is backed by cash and other traditional assets.)\par \par \uc2 The volatility quickly drew attention in Washington, where stablecoins have been on regulators' radar. Last fall, the Treasury Department issued a report calling on Congress to devise rules for the stablecoin ecosystem.\par \par \uc2 ''We really need a regulatory framework,'' Treasury Secretary \uc2 Janet Yellen\uc2  said at a congressional hearing on Thursday. ''In the last couple of days, we've had a real-life demonstration of the risks.''\par \par \uc2 Stablecoins ''present the same kinds of risks that we have known for centuries in connection with bank runs,'' she added.\par \par \uc2 Other parts of the crypto ecosystem soured at the same time. On Tuesday, \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges, reported a $430 million quarterly loss and said it had lost more than two million active users. The company's stock price has plunged 82 percent since its triumphant market debut in April 2021.\par \par \uc2 Brian Armstrong\uc2 , \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 's chief executive, tried to reassure customers on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that the company was not in danger of going bankrupt after a required legal disclosure about the ownership of its assets stoked panic.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency prices also dropped precipitously. The price of Bitcoin fell as low as $26,000 on Thursday, down 60 percent from its peak in November, before rising somewhat. Since the start of the year, Bitcoin's price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark that's heavily weighted toward technology stocks, suggesting that investors are treating it like any other risk asset.\par \par \uc2 The price of Ether plunged, too, losing more than 30 percent of its value over the last week. Other cryptocurrencies, like Solana and Cardano, are also down.\par \par \uc2 Any panic might be overblown, some analysts said. A study by \uc2 Mizuho\uc2  showed that the average Bitcoin owner on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  would not lose money until the digital currency's price sank below $21,000. That, according to Mr. Dolev, is where a true death spiral could occur.\par \par \uc2 ''Bitcoin was working as long as no one lost money,'' he said. ''Once it gets back to those levels, that's sort of the 'Oh, my God' moment.''\par \par \uc2 Professional investors who have weathered past crypto volatility also stayed calm. Hunter Horsley, chief executive of Bitwise Asset Management, which provides crypto investing services to 1,000 financial advisers, met with more than 70 of them this week to discuss the market. Many were not selling, he said, because every other asset was down, too. Some were even trying to capitalize on the drop.\par \par \uc2 ''Their standpoint is, 'This is no fun, but there is nowhere to hide,''' he said.\par \par \uc2 Still, the plummeting prices have rattled crypto traders. Just a few months ago, \uc2 blockchain\uc2  proponents were predicting that Bitcoin's price could rise as high as $100,000 this year.\par \par \uc2 ''I never thought things would get ugly this fast,'' said \uc2 Ed Moya\uc2 , a crypto analyst at the trading firm \uc2 OANDA\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 Alan Rappeport contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 Panic among investors this week has led to the worst reset in cryptocurrencies since 2018. Some traders said the alarm was reminiscent of the start of the 2008 financial crisis. Left, workers installing a cryptocurrency mining data center in Medley, Fla.

\par\par \uc2 ROSS DOUTHAT\par \uc2 Editorial Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Musk Has Bigger Plans Than Just Letting Trump Back on \uc2 Twitter\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ross Douthat \par \uc2 1,629 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 23\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 ''I strongly supported Obama for President,'' \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  tweeted late last month, part of the spree of ideological comments accompanying his continuing takeover of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , ''but today's Democratic Party has been hijacked by extremists.'' Around the same time, he set the social-media platform ablaze by reposting a cartoon showing a stick figure comfortably on the center-left in 2008 redefined as a right-wing bigot by 2021 because the left-wing stick figure had raced way off to the left. Then this week, he expressed the same kind of thought in the abbreviated style for which the site is famous: ''\uc2 Twitter\uc2  obv has a strong left wing bias.''\par \par \uc2 And now, at last, we have the news that he's likely to allow \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  to tweet freely once again.\par \par \uc2 All of these comments and promises align the country's richest man with the rightward side in our culture war. But though I don't know Musk -- I've never interviewed him or hung out with him in any secret billionaire lair -- I think I know enough about him, and I know enough Silicon Valley people like him, to suggest that neither his tweeted self-descriptions nor the criticisms being lobbed his way capture what's distinctive about his position and worldview.\par \par \uc2 A term like ''conservative'' doesn't fit the \uc2 Tesla\uc2  tycoon; even ''libertarian,'' while closer to the mark, associates Musk with a lot of ideas that I don't think he particularly cares about. A better label comes from Virginia Postrel, in her 1998 book ''The Future and Its Enemies'': Musk is what she calls a ''dynamist,'' meaning someone whose primary commitments are to exploration and discovery, someone who believes that the best society is one that's always inventing, transforming, doing something new.\par \par \uc2 If you think this sounds uncontroversial, think again. First, the dynamist may not care where novelty and invention spring from: Unlike the purist libertarian, he might be indifferent to questions of public versus private spending, happy to embrace government help if that's what it takes to get the new thing off the ground -- and happy to take that help from regimes like Communist China no less than from our own. And he may be willing to risk much more than either the typical progressive or the typical conservative for the sake of innovation. Political principle, social stability and moral order are all potentially negotiable when discovery alone is your North Star.\par \par \uc2 For many people, dynamism is contingent -- on how invested you are in the world as it is, whether you stand to lose or benefit from innovations, and where your moral intuitions lie. (I am personally a dynamist about Musk's Mars colony but not \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2 's metaverse; flying cars, yes, sex robots, not so much.) Even in the tech world, your appetite for dynamism depends on where you stand: If you're lucky enough to work for one of Silicon Valley's near monopolies, the new powers of the age, you may not be that interested in further churn or change.\par \par \uc2 Musk himself may yet evolve into that kind of comfortable monopolist, but for now, pending the I.P.O. for MarsCorp in 2047, he remains a dynamist in full. And seen in this light, his recent transformation from Obama Democrat to progressive foil makes perfect sense in light of the transformations that liberalism itself has undergone of late.\par \par \uc2 Liberalism in the Obama era was an essentially dynamist enterprise not because liberals were absolutely committed to capital-S Science but because those years encouraged a confidence that the major technological changes of the 21st century were making the world a more liberal place. Whether it was social media shaking Middle Eastern autocrats, the Obama campaign running circles around its Republican opponents with online organizing or just the general drift leftward on social issues that seemed to accompany the internet revolution, progressives around 2010 felt a general confidence that technological and political progress were conjoined.\par \par \uc2 Ever since Trump bent history's arc his way, however, that confidence has diminished or collapsed. Now liberals increasingly regard the internet as the zone of monsters and misinformation, awash in illiberalism, easily manipulated by demagogues, a breeding ground for insurrectionists. And if digital technology has become particularly suspect, via the transitive property so has the larger idea of innovating your way out of social or environmental problems -- empowering the part of the environmental movement that wants to tame capitalism to save the planet, for instance, at the expense of the part that imagines taming climate change with fleets of Teslas and nuclear power plants.\par \par \uc2 Meanwhile, the values underlying dynamism -- above all, the special pedestal given to free thinking and free speech -- are also more suspect within liberalism today. In their place is a new regulatory spirit around culture as well as economics, a how-much-is-too-much attitude toward the circulation of potentially dangerous ideas, a belief in institutions of scientific and intellectual authority but not necessarily institutions devoted to wide-open inquiry.\par \par \uc2 Just as a dynamist might, at the extreme of the orientation, prefer a monarchy that protects innovation over a democracy that discourages it, some of today's progressives are making the same move in reverse: If democracy is endangered by technological change and unfettered free speech, then so much the worse for free speech. The important thing is to save democratic self-government, even if you have to temporarily take the ''liberties'' out of \uc2 the American Civil Liberties Union\uc2  or put away your John Stuart Mill.\par \par \uc2 Whatever else Musk wants with \uc2 Twitter\uc2  -- and obviously you should assume that he wants to make a lot of money -- this seems like the ideological trend he hopes to resist or halt: the liberal retreat from dynamism, the progressive turn toward ideological regulation, the pervasive left-wing fear that the First Amendment and free speech are being weaponized by authoritarians and need some kind of check.\par \par \uc2 So now the question: If this was your ambition -- setting aside whether you think it's admirable or dangerous -- would buying \uc2 Twitter\uc2  make sense?\par \par \uc2 The affirmative theory holds that because \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is both an essential digital town square and a place particularly populated by well-educated liberals, if Musk can make it succeed with a lighter-footprint approach to content moderation, from a dynamist perspective he might hope to accomplish two goals at once. First, he would be simply sustaining an important space in which free debate can happen. Second -- assuming that he could come up with a light footprint that left-leaning users would accept -- he would be gently training \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's liberals back into their Obama-era belief that openness and dynamism are good things, that a marketplace of ideas can work without constant ideological supervision and constraint.\par \par \uc2 The more skeptical theory, on the other hand, suggests that Musk may be making a mistake somewhat characteristic of the Silicon Valley mentality and overestimating the importance of novel virtual spaces compared with the legacy institutions -- East Coast, brick and mortar, academic and bureaucratic -- that still give contemporary liberalism its actual shape and direction. That is to say, what you see on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the fads and mobs and performativity, may accelerate certain ideological transformations, but social media isn't actually the place where these shifts are taking shape; it's just the space in which the change becomes visible and legible to people on the outside.\par \par \uc2 So, for instance, if important media institutions are more doubtful about free speech than in the past, or if important academic fields are more likely to impose ideological loyalty oaths, or if important foundations and funders are creating a climate of intellectual conformity, a social media town platform is too far downstream of those changes to really help reverse them.\par \par \uc2 A free-speech-oriented \uc2 Twitter\uc2  can certainly surface individuals or even small-scale factions offering diversity and dissent. But institutions of employment and ambition will always matter most -- there's no app-based solution or simple \uc2 blockchain\uc2  fix if you think the Ivy League and the mainstream media have gone terribly astray. At some point you need to make change within those institutions themselves, start new ones -- the Musk Schools! the Musk Herald-Tribune! the Musk Foundation! -- or do both.\par \par \uc2 Since a big part of Musk's success and wealth comes from looking for tech's applications in the real world -- meaning cars, rockets and tunnels, not just apps and tweets -- it's quite possible that he's already considered all of this and that he has an ultimate vision for a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  as a virtual network that links reformed or revitalized institutions in the real world.\par \par \uc2 Or alternatively, maybe he believes that very soon the virtual will fully displace the world of bricks and bodies and that in buying \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , he's literally buying the digital real estate where his fellow dynamists will build the great institutions of tomorrow.\par \par \uc2 It's one of dynamism's strengths as a guiding ideology that it can inspire those kinds of leaps. But its weakness is usually the same one that doomed Icarus. Sometimes you leap and have a bird's wings to bear you upward. Sometimes, though, all you have is its disintegrating feathers -- or, still worse, not its plumage but its tweets.\par \par \uc2 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A young man sporting elf ears and a pink beard danced shirtless to trance music. A crowd of people sipped Liquid Death, a new water brand marketed at festivals, as they shimmied and swayed, striking up conversations with strangers. Bystanders sat on grassy hills for a bird's-eye view, taking in the colorful scene with intrigue. In a corner, a woman tested out a ''sensory experience'' chair, wearing a virtual-reality headset as her high-tech chair vibrated vigorously. Candy-scented clouds traveled from vape to mouth to air.\par \par \uc2 Welcome to Robot Heart. These parties, organized by the Robot Heart Foundation, which describes itself as a ''collective of dreamers and doers,'' typically lean toward a communal, countercultural brand of fun, and are normally held in Nevada's Black Rock Desert during Burning Man festivals.\par \par \uc2 On this occasion, however, the foundation was celebrating its inaugural event in New York City, billed as Fare Forward, at Wollman Rink in Central Park. The merriment was a tad more controlled in its new urban environs. Police officers monitored the scene, and all of the action began at 2 p.m. on a Saturday and Sunday and ended promptly at 10 p.m. -- an acceptable bedtime.\par \par \uc2 This two-day affair, on April 30 and May 1, was a return to glory, in a sense. The pandemic put a hard pause on Robot Heart, which debuted in 2008, just as it did the much-larger Burning Man festival. The loss was acutely felt among ''Burners'' (passionate festival devotees).\par \par \uc2 This gathering has grown into a refuge for a motley crowd that includes creative nomads, Bushwick art performers and Silicon Valley tech heads. At each event, a 1972 ''Mad Max''-esque Bristol bus outfitted with speakers, called the ''Robot Heart Art Bus,'' blasts sets by renowned D.J.s.\par \par \uc2 The sun-soaked reprieves from the outside world were founded and led by George Mueller, known as ''Geo,'' who died unexpectedly last year from a cerebral aneurysm. This month's festival was the first Robot Heart event thrown since his death, and attendees let loose in part to honor him.\par \par \uc2 A democratic, egalitarian spirt reigned on the dance floor. Bodies were pressed close together as strangers connected. Occasionally, someone would spot an old friend they had met at Burning Man and shout hello. When nightfall arrived, colorful LED lights glided over the crowd and articles of clothing were strewn throughout the grounds. Kisses were exchanged here and there.\par \par \uc2 And there was plenty to do in the V.I.P. section, accessible with tickets. Guests ordered giant plates of sushi (which ranged from $200 to $1,500). A tent for meditation and tarot card readings was pitched.\par \par \uc2 This Robot Heart may not have embodied the full-fledged festival experience many of the attendees desperately craved. That will come this summer, when Burning Man makes its long-awaited return to Black Rock. But, after a two-year pause on festival life, the weekend served an important purpose that mirrors much of this year: inching back to normal.\par \par \uc2 Nana Meriwether\par \par \uc2 Age: 36\par \par \uc2 From: Washington, D.C., and New York City\par \par \uc2 I heard you're a pageant star.\par \par \uc2 I won Miss USA many years ago.\par \par \uc2 Congrats. What do you do now?\par \par \uc2 I work in \uc2 blockchain\uc2  at a firm that was founded by the guy behind Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 What brings you out here today?\par \par \uc2 Today is a celebration of life. Robot Heart is one of the most famous camps at Burning Man. If you go to Burning Man, you know Robot Heart.\par \par \uc2 How many times have you been to Burning Man?\par \par \uc2 This will be my fifth year. But my first year I hitchhiked from the airport, found a plot of land, pitched a tent and lived out in the desert for a week by myself.\par \par \uc2 Did you make friends?\par \par \uc2 Yes, absolutely. It's really a journey for yourself, whether you're in a camp or not. It completely changed my life.\par \par \uc2 What did you learn from that experience?\par \par \uc2 You really learn what you need to learn at that specific moment. At that time, I was really dealing with loneliness. And being alone. So I was alone for an entire week! I learned to finally be OK with being by myself. Now I've manifested a huge community here and other places.\par \par \uc2 Do you still feel lonely?\par \par \uc2 No. I've found myself. And the catalyst was Burning Man.\par \par \uc2 Tara Solomon\par \par \uc2 Age: 63\par \par \uc2 Occupation: Writer and entrepreneur\par \par \uc2 From: Miami Beach, Fla.\par \par \uc2 Tell me about your outfit.\par \par \uc2 Today's inspo was Walter Mercado meets Endora from ''Bewitched.'' Which is my everyday drag. This is not festival wear -- I look like this every day. I have never packed for a trip faster and with more joy.\par \par \uc2 Where are some of the pieces from?\par \par \uc2 The bag and glasses are Gucci. The ostrich jacket is Zac Posen. The ring is Alexander McQueen. Suede cowboy boots that my cousin bought for me in Texas. Vintage tights. Vintage Napier pendant necklace, probably from the mid-70s. Tom Ford Beauty makeup.\par \par \uc2 Is it fair to assume you're a big fan of vintage clothing?\par \par \uc2 Yes. I've maxed out my saved searches on \uc2 eBay\uc2 . They won't let me put anymore!\par \par \uc2 What's the number on that?\par \par \uc2 Something like 150, I think.\par \par \uc2 What's the power of fashion for you?\par \par \uc2 It's about expressing yourself. But in order to express yourself, you have to know yourself. And in order to know yourself, you have to love yourself. I know myself very well.\par \par \uc2 Manchildblack and Monstah Black\par \par \uc2 Ages: 41 and 45\par \par \uc2 Occupation: Musicians who perform as the Illustrious Blacks.\par \par \uc2 Tell me about your outfits.\par \par \uc2 Manchildblack: These are our after-show ones, actually. We were performing today and had a whole different ensemble. But this is more of our casual after-performance look. And we're bringing you purity with the white.\par \par \uc2 Were your outfits matching onstage too?\par \par \uc2 Manchildblack: Yes. They were multicolored.\par \par \uc2 Monstah: And tight!\par \par \uc2 Where are you based?\par \par \uc2 Manchildblack: Planet Brooklyn. We are currently in the Republic of Bed-Stuy. However we are going to be traveling to the magical land of Flatbush very soon.\par \par \uc2 Tell me about your musical style.\par \par \uc2 Manchildblack: We call ourselves the ''afro-electro-disco space punks.''\par \par \uc2 Monstah: It ranges from house funk, disco and techno, a little bit of punk thrown in there.\par \par \uc2 What are some shows coming up that you're excited to perform at?\par \par \uc2 Manchildblack: Lisbon, Portugal! We're going to celebrate Pride there with them.\par \par \uc2 Leiti Hsu, a.k.a. 'the Dining Dominatrix'\par \par \uc2 Age: 36\par \par \uc2 What's the meaning behind ''Dining Dominatrix''?\par \par \uc2 I'm all about spoiling you with food, love, permission and pleasure.\par \par \uc2 Tell me about your outfit.\par \par \uc2 If you took the word ''compersion'' -- which is all about loving other people having love and pleasure -- and put it into a kaleidoscope, and then took the color hot pink. Ta-da! It's an explosion of pleasure.\par \par \uc2 Andy and Keke Levy\par \par \uc2 Ages: 60 and 44\par \par \uc2 What do you do?\par \par \uc2 Andy: I'm a surgeon.\par \par \uc2 Tell me about your outfits.\par \par \uc2 Andy: It's from our costume closet. Which is bigger than our regular closet!\par \par \uc2 Keke: I wanted something shimmery. Something that shimmers in the sun while I dance.\par \par \uc2 What brings you here today?\par \par \uc2 Andy: We go way back with these folks. We've been going to Burning Man for over 10 years. It's like a family reunion for us. Throughout the pandemic and everything, we haven't been able to see our friends. You know, people who go to Burning Man love masks, but we suck at social distancing. We like to hug.\par \par \uc2 Do festivals play a big role in your marriage?\par \par \uc2 Andy: Not festivals in general. It's more so certain festivals, certain events. A lot of our friends like to get dressed up. It's more great parties with wonderful people we happen to meet in the desert.\par \par \uc2 Olga Rakhova\par \par \uc2 Age: ''Ageless''\par \par \uc2 Occupation: Designer\par \par \uc2 OK, tell me about the horse prop you're carrying.\par \par \uc2 Apparently my genetic female line, according to \uc2 23andMe\uc2 , came from a group in Africa that settled 2,000 years ago and took care of horses. So maybe that's why I was drawn to it. I have horses in many colors and I match them to my outfit. But I only take them out to places where they will be accepted, like here.\par \par \uc2 Does he have a name?\par \par \uc2 Fernando.\par \par \uc2 How long did it take to get ready?\par \par \uc2 Not long. I had to dress the horse and some of my friends too.\par \par \uc2 Gaby Endo\par \par \uc2 Age: 34\par \par \uc2 What do you do?\par \par \uc2 I have a costume shop here in New York City. It's where I got this costume from.\par \par \uc2 What's it called?\par \par \uc2 Harmonia NY.\par \par \uc2 Tell me about your outfit.\par \par \uc2 I'm telling a story about happiness, fluidity and celebrating the cause of life, which is why we're all here today. We're here to be happy, to express ourselves. This outfit is spring awakening.\par \par \uc2 Do you go to Burning Man and other festivals a lot?\par \par \uc2 Yes, I've gone for five years. I am also a D.J. I'm playing the after-party.\par \par \uc2 Have you made any new friends today?\par \par \uc2 I actually know a lot of people here from Burning Man. So it's been a lot of catching up. I also have a baby, so I was busy at home with him before this. Now the babysitter's watching him.\par \par \uc2 An inflatable mushroom shaded some festivalgoers at Robot Heart's Fare Forward event at Wollman Rink in Central Park on April 30.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Battered Bitcoin Is Proving All That Glitters Isn't Gold\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 947 \uc2 words\par \uc2 12 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 SAN FRANCISCO -- Bitcoin was conceived more than a decade ago as ''digital gold,'' a long-term store of value that would resist broader economic trends and provide a hedge against inflation.\par \par \uc2 But Bitcoin's crashing price over the last month shows that vision is a long way from reality. Instead, traders are increasingly treating the cryptocurrency like just another speculative tech investment.\par \par \uc2 Since the start of this year, Bitcoin's price movement has closely mirrored that of the Nasdaq, a benchmark that's heavily weighted toward technology stocks, according to an analysis by the data firm Arcane Research. That means that as Bitcoin's price dropped more than 25 percent over the last month, to under $30,000 on Wednesday -- less than half its November peak -- the plunge came in near lock step with a broader collapse of tech stocks as investors grappled with higher interest rates and the war in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 The growing correlation helps explain why those who bought the cryptocurrency last year, hoping it would grow more valuable, have seen their investment crater. And while Bitcoin has always been volatile, its increasing resemblance to risky tech stocks starkly shows that its promise as a transformative asset remains unfulfilled.\par \par \uc2 ''It delegitimizes the argument that Bitcoin is like gold,'' said Vetle Lunde, an analyst for Arcane. ''Evidence points in favor of Bitcoin just being a risk asset.''\par \par \uc2 Arcane Research assigned a numeric score between 1 and -1 to capture the pricing correlation between Bitcoin and the Nasdaq. A score of 1 indicated an exact correlation, meaning the prices moved in tandem, and a score of -1 represented an exact divergence.\par \par \uc2 Since Jan. 1, the 30-day average of the Bitcoin-Nasdaq score has approached 1, reaching 0.82 this week, the closest it had ever been to an exact, one-to-one correlation. At the same time, Bitcoin's price movement has diverged from fluctuations in the price of gold, the asset to which it has been most often compared.\par \par \uc2 The convergence with the Nasdaq has grown over the course of the coronavirus pandemic, driven partly by institutional investors like hedge funds, endowments and family offices that have poured money into the cryptocurrency market.\par \par \uc2 Unlike the idealists who drove the initial enthusiasm for Bitcoin in the 2010s, these professional traders are treating the cryptocurrency as part of a larger portfolio of high-risk, high-reward tech investments. Some of them are under pressure to secure short-term returns for clients and are less ideologically committed to Bitcoin's long-term potential. And when they lose faith in the tech industry more broadly, that affects their Bitcoin trades.\par \par \uc2 ''Five years ago, people who were in crypto were crypto people,'' said Mike Boroughs, a founder of the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  investment fund Fortis Digital. ''Now you've got guys who are across the whole span of risk assets. So when they're getting hit over there, it's impacting their psychology.''\par \par \uc2 Worries in the stock market -- affected by challenging economic trends, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the historic levels of inflation -- have particularly manifested themselves in falling tech stocks this year. \uc2 Meta\uc2 , the company formerly known as \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , is down more than 40 percent this year. \uc2 Netflix\uc2  has lost 70 percent of its value.\par \par \uc2 On Wednesday, shares of \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , the cryptocurrency exchange, plummeted 26 percent after it reported declining revenue and a loss of $430 million in the first quarter. The company's stock has fallen more than 75 percent overall this year.\par \par \uc2 The Nasdaq is already in bear-market territory, having ended Wednesday down 29 percent from its mid-November record. November was also when Bitcoin's price hit a peak of nearly $70,000. The crash has been a reality check for Bitcoin evangelists.\par \par \uc2 ''There was this undeniable retail belief that Bitcoin at the end of last year was an inflation hedge -- it was a safe haven, it was going to replace the dollar,'' said \uc2 Ed Moya\uc2 , a cryptocurrency analyst at the trading company \uc2 OANDA\uc2 . ''And what happened was inflation started to become very ugly, and Bitcoin lost half of its value.''\par \par \uc2 The prices of other cryptocurrencies have also been crushed. The price of Ether, the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, has dropped about 25 percent just since early April, to under $2,300. Others, like Solana and Cardano, have also experienced precipitous drops this year.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin has rebounded from major losses before, and its long-term growth remains impressive. Before the pandemic boom in crypto prices, its value hovered well below $10,000. True believers, who call themselves Bitcoin maximalists, remain adamant that the cryptocurrency will eventually break from its correlation with risk assets.\par \par \uc2 Michael Saylor\uc2 , the chief executive of the business-intelligence company \uc2 MicroStrategy\uc2 , has spent billions of his firm's money on Bitcoin, building up a stockpile of more than 125,000 coins. As the price of Bitcoin has cratered, the company's stock has dropped roughly 75 percent since November.\par \par \uc2 In an email, Mr. Saylor blamed the crash on ''traders and technocrats'' who don't appreciate Bitcoin's long-term potential to transform the global financial system.\par \par \uc2 ''In the near term, the market will be dominated by those with less appreciation of the virtues of Bitcoin,'' he said. ''Over the long term, the maximalists will be proven correct, because billions of people need this solution, and awareness is spreading to millions more each month.''\par \par \uc2 Servers at a Bitcoin mine in Rockdale, Texas.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The pop singer spent the last year working with the digital artist on a video series about motherhood. Proceeds will benefit three nonprofits.\par \par \uc2 Has Madonna embraced the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 The pop superstar's interest in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, caught some fans off guard in March, when she paid 180 ether, a digital currency worth $560,000 at the time, for an NFT of a tattooed ape from the Bored Ape Yacht Club, a collection of digital art.\par \par \uc2 On Monday, the singer released her own NFT series, titled ''Mother of Creation'' -- three digitally rendered videos that recast her as a nude woman giving birth to flora, fauna and technology. The artworks are the result of a yearlong collaboration with Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple.\par \par \uc2 ''This is such an absolute, insane honor,'' said Winkelmann, who is known for selling an NFT in 2021 for $69 million at \uc2 Christie's\uc2 . ''I don't do many collaborations. This is probably the only one I will do for a very long time.''\par \par \uc2 From Wednesday through Friday, Madonna and Beeple's NFTs will be auctioned for charity through the online marketplace SuperRare.\par \par \uc2 ''It's counterintuitive to who I am,'' Madonna said in a phone interview, explaining that her initial struggle with the concept of digital assets made her want to explore what she saw as the elements of faith and community that drive the NFT market.\par \par \uc2 From there, Beeple and Madonna developed three videos in which audiences have a full-frontal view of Madonna's avatar giving birth to different organisms from a hospital bed, a rusted vehicle, and a forest floor. The singer has paired each video with poetry -- some her own and some by the mystic poet Rumi.\par \par \uc2 ''I never want to be provocative just for the sake of provocation,'' said Madonna, insisting that the butterflies and centipedes she gives birth to in the video mean something. ''They stand for hope. They stand for technology.''\par \par \uc2 Proceeds from the NFTs will benefit three nonprofits supporting women and children: the Voices of Children Foundation, which cares for those affected by the war in Ukraine; the City of Joy Foundation, which helps survivors of violence in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and Black Mama's Bail Out, which provides bail for incarcerated caregivers.\par \par \uc2 The charity auction comes at a time when the NFT market's future remains uncertain.\par \par \uc2 John Crain, a founder and chief executive of SuperRare, said that his company did $10 million in sales last month compared to a $35 million high set in October. He sees the discrepancy not as a sign of the NFT market's demise but of its maturation.\par \par \uc2 ''It's been a frothy year, but marketplaces are inherently volatile,'' Crain said. ''There are fluctuations, but I wouldn't call it a bear market.''\par \par \uc2 A still from Madonna and Beeple's NFT artwork ''Mother of Creation'' (2022), part of a series they made.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Musk Adds Investors To Fund \uc2 Twitter\uc2  Deal\b0\par\par\uc2 By Lauren Hirsch, Anupreeta Das, Erin Griffith and Mike Isaac \par \uc2 1,467 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The filing lists a number of investment firms and other backers who will contribute $7 billion to the deal.\par \par \uc2 In numerous conversations over the last several days, \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  began making promises about what he could do with \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk, the world's richest man, told potential investors that he could double the number of users on the platform to more than half a billion by 2025, four people briefed on the conversations said. Not only that, he said, he could more than double \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's revenue by that date and bring tens of millions of paying subscribers to the service, two of the people said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk added that investors would make a handsome return if they bought into his pitch. And he told them that he would take charge of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , at least for a time, as its chief executive.\par \par \uc2 Investors bought in. On Thursday, Mr. Musk revealed that he had raised around $7 billion from 18 entities to help fund his blockbuster $44 billion acquisition of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . The investors were a mix of Mr. Musk's Silicon Valley friends -- including venture capital firms such as \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  and tech moguls like \uc2 Larry Ellison\uc2  -- as well as cryptocurrency companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, property firms and mutual-fund companies.\par \par \uc2 While many traditional private equity firms passed on participating because of concerns over Mr. Musk's business plans for \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , Silicon Valley investors and others clamored to join the financing, people with knowledge of the situation said. The overriding reason was their faith in Mr. Musk, they said.\par \par \uc2 ''We believe in Elon's brilliance to finally make it what it was meant to be,'' \uc2 Ben Horowitz\uc2 , a founder of \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , tweeted about Mr. Musk's takeover of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Horowitz, whose firm contributed $400 million, added that Mr. Musk was ''perhaps the only person in the world who has the courage, brilliance, and skills to fix'' \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's issues and ''build the public square that we all hoped for and deserve.''\par \par \uc2 The new funding commitments were a sign that Mr. Musk, who leads the electric carmaker \uc2 Tesla\uc2  and the rocket company \uc2 SpaceX\uc2 , was continuing to figure out his plans for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  after striking a deal 10 days ago to buy the company. When the 50-year-old announced his intention to take over \uc2 Twitter\uc2  last month, he appeared far from prepared. He had no financing lined up, did not say who might lead the company and did not articulate how it might make money.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Mr. Musk spoke in general terms. He said he planned to take \uc2 Twitter\uc2  private so he could work on improving the product away from the public eye. He also said he wanted to promote more free speech on the platform.\par \par \uc2 The lack of a comprehensive plan was typical for Mr. Musk, who often acts on impulse and figures out the details later. That leads to plenty of risks and means investors often have to take a big leap to invest with him.\par \par \uc2 Even so, Mr. Musk's seat-of-the-pants methods have led to tremendous successes, including making \uc2 Tesla\uc2  the world's most valuable automaker and pioneering the privatization of space launches with \uc2 SpaceX\uc2 . That record helped draw the new investors -- which also include \uc2 Binance\uc2 , the cryptocurrency exchange, and \uc2 Qatar Holding\uc2 , a sovereign wealth fund -- to the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  deal, investors said.\par \par \uc2 ''Many more people have made money betting on Elon than against him,'' said \uc2 Mark Pincus\uc2 , who founded the social gaming company \uc2 Zynga\uc2  and knows Mr. Musk.\par \par \uc2 Many of the new investors also shared Mr. Musk's views or interests. Just like the billionaire, for example, \uc2 Marc Andreessen\uc2 , a founder of \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , is a free-speech enthusiast and a backer of crypto technologies.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk said in a securities filing on Thursday that he was continuing to talk with other investors, including \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's co-founder. The two men have discussed rolling over Mr. Dorsey's stake in the company so he would remain an investor once Mr. Musk took over, Mr. Musk said. He is also reviewing requests from other investors and could announce additional capital commitments in coming weeks, one person briefed on the matter said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk and a spokeswoman for Mr. Dorsey did not respond to requests for comment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk's original financing package for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  included $13 billion in loans from seven banks, $21 billion of his own cash and a $12.5 billion loan against his shares in \uc2 Tesla\uc2 . With the new equity commitments, Mr. Musk said he was reducing the size of the loan against his \uc2 Tesla\uc2  shares to $6.25 billion. He has not outlined the sources of the $21 billion in cash for the deal.\par \par \uc2 The new funds could give investors more confidence that Mr. Musk's deal for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  will close. Some investors had bet against that likelihood, given Mr. Musk's unpredictable nature and how much capital he may personally be on the hook for. The deal is not set to close for three to six months. Mr. Musk must pay a $1 billion breakup fee if his financing falls apart.\par \par \uc2 ''This was a smart financial and strategic move by Musk that will be well received across the board,'' said \uc2 Daniel Ives\uc2 , a managing director and analyst at the investment firm \uc2 Wedbush\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk's bankers at \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  reached out to some investors late last week, said one person who heard the pitch. In meetings, Mr. Musk criticized \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's current state and pitched his vision for improving the company's product and business model, the person said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Musk told investors that he was highly confident he could double or triple their money. He added that while a return of five to 10 times would be a challenge, it was possible if all went well. The billionaire also promised to devote time and energy to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , the person said.\par \par \uc2 The projected numbers included \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's annual revenue exceeding $13 billion and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of profitability -- potentially hitting $6 billion by 2025, two people who viewed the numbers said.\par \par \uc2 Investors were given a few days to make a decision. Some balked at the speed and lack of detail on governance issues, including voting rights, information rights and the makeup of \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's board of directors under Mr. Musk's stewardship, one person said. The $44 billion that Mr. Musk is paying for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  was also a sticking point, given the company's inconsistent profits, the person said.\par \par \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Some investors didn't wait for Mr. Musk to reach out to them. \uc2 Binance\uc2  contacted him directly, a person familiar with the situation said, and is investing $500 million. The cryptocurrency exchange saw an opportunity to use the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , a database for digital information, to help tackle bots, which are automated accounts that spam people, the person said.\par \par \uc2 ''A small contribution to the cause,'' \uc2 Changpeng Zhao\uc2 , \uc2 Binance\uc2 's founder, said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  about the investment. (The company also recently invested in Forbes, aiming to integrate cryptocurrency with a traditional media company.)\par \par \uc2 Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley venture firm, invested $800 million and said it had ''had a front-row seat to Elon's business and technical prowess'' for two decades.\par \par \uc2 ''We see, as he does, the opportunity to drive meaningful product innovation that will help unlock \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's full potential as a global platform that connects the world,'' a spokeswoman for \uc2 Sequoia\uc2  said.\par \par \uc2 Brookfield\uc2 , a real estate management firm, invested $250 million through its technology growth investing arm. The firm has used \uc2 Tesla\uc2  technology to add solar panels to some of its properties and recently invested in SpaceX. Brookfield declined to comment.\par \par \uc2 Other investors include Vy Capital, an internet-focused investment firm in Dubai; Litani Ventures, the investment fund for Peter Rahal, the founder of RxBar; and DFJ Growth IV Partners, a venture firm.\par \par \uc2 Prince Al Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia said he planned to remain a \uc2 Twitter\uc2  investor, with a stake worth roughly $1.9 billion. Last month, the prince said in a tweet that \uc2 Twitter\uc2  should reject Mr. Musk's takeover offer because it was not high enough to reflect the ''intrinsic value of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  given its growth prospects.''\par \par \uc2 On Thursday, the prince, who did not respond to a request for comment, called Mr. Musk his ''new friend'' in a tweet. The billionaire will be an ''excellent leader for \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Goldstein, Ryan Mac and Melina Delkic contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 Matthew Goldstein, Ryan Mac and Melina Delkic contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 Changpeng Zhao of Binance, which is contributing $500 million to the deal.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 REGULATION\par \par \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  Settles Garnishment Case\par \par \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  is paying $10 million to settle a regulator's claim that it illegally helped some creditors strip funds out of its customers' accounts, the \uc2 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\uc2  said Wednesday.\par \par \uc2 The bureau, which brought the case against the bank, said \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  had forced the customers to agree to contracts that limited their ability to fight the creditors' actions. In 3,700 cases, the bureau said, \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  also made customers pay a total of just under $600,000 in ''garnishment fees'' for processing their creditors' fund-extraction requests.\par \par \uc2 ''\uc2 Bank of America\uc2  imposed unlawful garnishment fees and injured its customers by inserting unenforceable clauses into contracts in an attempt to strip legal rights from families,'' said \uc2 Rohit Chopra\uc2 , the bureau's director.\par \par \uc2 A \uc2 Bank of America\uc2  spokesman said the bank was refunding the customers in the 3,700 cases. EMILY FLITTER\par \par \uc2 LEGAL\par \par \uc2 New York Pension Funds\par \par \uc2 Sue Activision Over Sale\par \par \uc2 Five New York City employee pension groups that own stock in \uc2 Activision Blizzard\uc2 , the embattled video game maker, are suing \uc2 Activision\uc2 , saying that the company failed to turn over financial records as the groups try to investigate whether \uc2 Activision\uc2  secured a fair price in its planned sale to \uc2 Microsoft\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit, filed in Delaware state court, says that the New York groups are asking whether \uc2 Activision\uc2  did a disservice to its shareholders by agreeing to sell the company to \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  for about $70 billion, or about $95 per share, which the pension groups say is undervalued. But they cannot dig into the corporate records that they want to review, the lawsuit says, because \uc2 Activision\uc2  has refused to turn them all over.\par \par \uc2 The groups ''seek access to certain books and records to investigate the independence and disinterestedness of the board,'' the lawsuit says, referring to \uc2 Activision\uc2 's board of directors.\par \par \uc2 The complaint was reported earlier on Wednesday by Axios.\par \par \uc2 KELLEN BROWNING\par \par \uc2 CURRENCIES\par \par \uc2 California Is Set\par \par \uc2 To Embrace Crypto\par \par \uc2 California on Wednesday began to formally examine how to broadly adapt to cryptocurrency and related innovations, following a path laid out by President Biden in March.\par \par \uc2 Gov. \uc2 Gavin Newsom\uc2  signed an executive order for state agencies to move in tandem with the federal government to craft regulations for digital currencies. It also calls for officials to explore incorporating broader \uc2 blockchain\uc2  computer coding into the government operations of the state where much of the world's technological innovation is born.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Newsom's order says the state should be out front in figuring out how to adapt to new technologies.\par \par \uc2 While California may be first to try to develop a comprehensive approach, Ohio was the first to attempt to accept virtual currency for government services in 2018, though the program was soon discontinued because few people used it.

\par\par \uc2 YOUR MONEY\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 He Was a Crypto Executive With a Story to Tell, Until I Discovered It Didn't Add Up\b0\par\par\uc2 By Ron Lieber \par \uc2 2,007 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 May 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The chief operating officer of ZenLedger, a software company, boasted of work for \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and Larry King. Did anyone check to see if it was true?\par \par \uc2 When ZenLedger put out word of a deal in March for the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  to keep using its software, Dan Hannum said he was ''thrilled.'' It was a big moment for the company, which has the backing of \uc2 Mark Cuban\uc2  and other investors as it aims to be a kind of TurboTax for crypto enthusiasts.\par \par \uc2 It was no surprise Mr. Hannum was front and center in ZenLedger's news release. As its chief operating officer, he had spoken with the voice of the company to The Wall Street Journal, Politico and numerous podcasters.\par \par \uc2 And who wouldn't want to talk to him? In interviews -- and a lengthy Forbes profile -- he talked about turning his life around and getting his M.B.A., stints at Wall Street heavyweights like \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , and staggeringly profitable crypto investments that allowed him to make millions of dollars for himself and people like the talk show host Larry King.\par \par \uc2 If only all of that were true.\par \par \uc2 Within a few weeks of announcing the I.R.S. deal, the company fired Mr. Hannum. I had asked ZenLedger about things I could not verify about Mr. Hannum after I talked to him for an article about crypto trading and taxes. Much of what he had said to others did not check out, either.\par \par \uc2 All emerging industries -- with their attendant opportunities for entrepreneurial people no one has heard of to get rich real quick -- draw at least a few fabulists. But it is astounding that Mr. Hannum got away with it for as long as he did, even if few of us should be surprised by now at the power of untruths and our own inclination to believe them.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannum initially tried to offer some proof and assurances that he was being truthful, but he stopped responding to me before he was dismissed. So I don't know why he did what he did.\par \par \uc2 But the fault isn't his alone. Stopping to ask questions is a good way to get left out of the bro-ish backslapping -- one podcaster referred to Mr. Hannum as an O.G., or original gangster -- that we see across the worlds of business, politics and digital culture. There's a nasty price to seeing only what we want to see: Slowly and then all at once, lying in public has come to feel like a reasonable strategy to getting or staying ahead. We need a little less mythmaking and a lot more fact-checking.\par \par \uc2 So first, the story he told about himself. It begins with the police pulling over a teenage Mr. Hannum with 17 pounds of marijuana, then a year in a program for juvenile offenders that was his warning bell. Then, he told interviewers, he attended the \uc2 University of South Carolina\uc2  as an undergraduate and earned his M.B.A. there, which led to stints at \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2 , \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 TD Ameritrade\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannum said he then caught the crypto bug and went west, working for \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Capital, which paid him in Bitcoin, and helped run a green-energy-focused initial coin offering. That venture, he said, netted Mr. King -- and the professional investors \uc2 Stan Bharti\uc2  and Jim Rogers -- many millions of dollars in a matter of weeks.\par \par \uc2 Enamored investors soon lined up to give Mr. Hannum more money, or so he said.\par \par \uc2 ''Rich people always have some extra dollars laying around that they're willing to throw away, or at least they're willing to risk a little bit,'' he said on ''The Fundamental Value,'' a podcast.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannum told the podcast that he had put up ''the first million'' and that Mr. King had given him $4 million -- as well as access to other well-heeled investors. ''He opened up his Rolodex, and that opened up tons of doors that I should have probably never had access to,'' Mr. Hannum said.\par \par \uc2 Eventually, Mr. Hannum claimed, he had $100 million under management and was placing bets on \uc2 blockchain\uc2  infrastructure. He said that one of those investments was ZenLedger, and that he had joined its C-suite after investing his fund's money.\par \par \uc2 Given the credibility that comes with a fancy title, it was only natural that people might have wanted to hear what he had to say and not stop to question it. (\uc2 Forbes\uc2  said it was looking into the details of the profile, which was written by a nonstaff contributor who it said had looked up ''basic details'' about Mr. Hannum but had not checked on his employment or education history.)\par \par \uc2 I first encountered Mr. Hannum in March, when I talked to him about crypto and taxes. Nothing about the advice he offered in our phone conversation set off any alarms -- in fact, it all checked out with the I.R.S.\par \par \uc2 But the life story he told me didn't quite add up.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 University of South Carolina\uc2  is a fine school, but not the first place snobby Wall Street banks look for new hires. And was Larry King, who died last year, really investing millions of dollars in crypto?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannum claimed to have paid millions in taxes alone on his crypto winnings, but his office in Charlotte, N.C., where he worked remotely, looked generic on Zoom. And don't all the crypto people live in Miami, anyway?\par \par \uc2 So I started asking around. It didn't take long to figure out that Mr. Hannum had made up a lot of it.\par \par \uc2 I could pick up the thread of his life only in college; juvenile court records are hard to come by. He did attend the \uc2 University of South Carolina\uc2  -- he emailed me a picture of his student identification card before he went dark -- but the school said he had completed neither an undergrad nor a graduate degree. And Goldman, \uc2 Morgan Stanley\uc2  and \uc2 TD Ameritrade\uc2  had no record of his being an employee.\par \par \uc2 W. Brad Stephens, a founder and managing partner of \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Capital, also said Mr. Hannum had never worked for him. ''I vaguely remember first meeting him around 2017, a meeting at our office for something he was trying to start,'' Mr. Stephens said in an email. ''We didn't invest. But he seemed like a nice young guy who was extremely excited about Bitcoin and \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 What about the three investors for whom Mr. Hannum claimed to have made millions? The offering never formally launched, according to a lawyer for the investment company that Mr. \uc2 Bharti\uc2  founded.\par \par \uc2 ''No profits were made by anyone,'' said the lawyer, Neil Said, responding to questions for Mr. \uc2 Bharti\uc2 , who was involved in the venture that sought to offer the coin.\par \par \uc2 Mr. King did record a video for the nascent initial coin offering, but his widow, Shawn, told me that he never had crypto investments and that she didn't know Mr. Hannum.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Rogers, who ran an investment fund with \uc2 George Soros\uc2  and wrote the book ''Investment Biker,'' said he had briefly been a ''skeptical adviser'' on the project since he did not expect it to work. He added that he had never bought cryptocurrency, let alone via Mr. Hannum.\par \par \uc2 ''I have never heard of him,'' he told me by email. ''This is all absurd.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hannum was somewhat connected to the failed venture: He worked at a marketing firm in Santa Monica, Calif., called Hawke Media that helped with it, according to Erik Huberman, Hawke's chief executive.\par \par \uc2 I could find no evidence that Mr. Hannum had made any venture investments, let alone $100 million worth. And it's not clear exactly how he found his way to ZenLedger. Pat Larsen, ZenLedger's chief executive and a founder, would not get on the phone with me and did not respond to any of my emails. I also wanted to know if he had read the big Forbes profile, where Mr. Hannum described how he had been an early funder of ZenLedger.\par \par \uc2 Rob Ford, an outside spokesman for ZenLedger, tried to clear some things up. He said that Mr. Hannum did not invest in ZenLedger and that Mr. Larsen had not read the Forbes article. The company does not believe Mr. Hannum ever misrepresented the company itself, he added.\par \par \uc2 (The I.R.S. connection is real: ZenLedger has four contracts, totaling $509,600, under the corporate name \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Analytics and Tax Software L.L.C. The agency said contracts generally remained in place until they expired. ''However,'' it added, ''government contracts, including this one, are subject to ongoing review in accordance with federal contracting standards.'')\par \par \uc2 So how did Mr. Hannum end up at ZenLedger?\par \par \uc2 ''Mr. Hannum was referred to ZenLedger through a professional relationship and was cleared by a federal background check with no flags regarding his education or work history,'' the company's statement said. ''Once it became evident that he had misrepresented his education and work history, as well as the nature of his role with ZenLedger, his employment with the company was terminated that day.''\par \par \uc2 A check of federal records is never a bad idea when hiring someone, but it probably wouldn't raise red flags about a person's professional or educational background. So if ZenLedger wasn't asking the right questions, what about its investors?\par \par \uc2 Firms that want in on a deal often lean on the due diligence that the so-called lead investor conducts. In ZenLedger's case, that was Bloccelerate, which led a $6 million funding round last year. At the time, a Bloccelerate general partner, Kate Mitselmakher, called the ZenLedger team ''talented, driven and creative.''\par \par \uc2 So how much did her firm know about that team?\par \par \uc2 ''Our due diligence was extensive, including talking to the I.R.S.,'' she told me. ''We did more due diligence than a traditional venture capitalist would have done.''\par \par \uc2 Bloccelerate vetted the company's chief technical officer, she said -- although she didn't think anyone had spoken to Mr. Hannum, the chief operating officer. ''No V.C. would be in business if we had to do background checks on everyone in the company,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 So what really happened here? Mr. Cuban, whose firm was also part of last year's funding round, offered some additional explanation in an email.\par \par \uc2 ''Most of us are naturally trusting, trying to focus on making our business a success, rather than looking underneath every r\u233\'00\'E9sum\u233\'00\'E9,'' he wrote. Fabricators can be a problem at any company, and had even bitten \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 , he noted.\par \par \uc2 ''People lie, and sometimes they are really good at lying,'' he said. ''All a company can do is move on.''\par \par \uc2 But accepting deceit is accepting defeat, and really, why should we? Perhaps Mr. Hannum could channel his enthusiasm toward a solution: Use the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  -- with all its promises of permanent, unalterable records -- to create an opt-in, verified platform for education and employment history. That way, people can't do what he did.\par \par \uc2 ZenLedger, at least, seems to have learned its lesson. Its new chief strategy and chief operations officers did stints at the \uc2 Central Intelligence Agency\uc2  and in the Green Berets. (I checked.)\par \par \uc2 And when Mr. Larsen said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in late March that ZenLedger was looking for a ''great leader and communicator'' to step into Mr. Hannum's old job, the posting he linked to highlighted work-from-anywhere flexibility and the option of getting at least part of your salary in crypto.\par \par \uc2 It also came with a warning: ''We will check references.''\par \par \uc2 Kirsten Noyes, Katie Robertson and David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 How can a career built on lies and half-truths make it so far, and what does it say about our times? Kirsten Noyes, Katie Robertson and David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Robert Neubecker FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220503ei530004r\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 Does Your Preschooler Need to Buy NFTs?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Amanda Hess \par \uc2 1,490 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 April 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The new frontier of children's entertainment is internet-native cartoon characters selling nonfungible tokens on social-media apps for tots.\par \par \uc2 When Olympia Ohanian -- the daughter of the tennis player Serena Williams and the internet entrepreneur \uc2 Alexis Ohanian\uc2  -- was an infant, her parents got her a plastic baby doll. Then they got that doll an \uc2 Instagram\uc2  account.\par \par \uc2 Qai Qai, as the doll was named, emerged on the platform in 2018 in a series of enigmatic photographs. Though the doll's feed resembled crime-scene photography -- Qai Qai could be dumped unceremoniously in a sandbox or splayed lifelessly on a lonely stretch of asphalt -- it also had a delightfully nostalgic quality. The images embodied the comic dark side of a young child's obsessional devotion to a beloved object: When a new plaything appears, the object may be ruthlessly discarded. Every photo of Qai Qai's casual neglect seemed infused with Olympia's own boundless spirit.\par \par \uc2 As the doll amassed followers, however, she adapted to the demands of various online platforms. Soon she had mutated into a computer-generated cartoon figure with doe eyes and a curlicue of hair atop her head. This new, seemingly sentient Qai Qai could lip-sync to viral videos like a TikTok star and wave from an F. A. O. Schwarz toy convertible like a mini influencer. Eventually the original Qai Qai doll vanished from social media, replaced instead by a new one styled after the cartoon version and available for purchase on \uc2 Amazon\uc2 . Last week, Qai Qai dropped her first NFT collection.\par \par \uc2 Qai Qai is part of a movement to drag children's entertainment into the digital future. She was animated by the tech company Invisible Universe, which develops internet-native cartoon-character intellectual property attached to celebrities. (Invisible Universe has also created a long-lost teddy bear character for the TikTok-famous D'Amelio family and a cartoon food influencer dog for Jennifer Aniston.) And Qai Qai's NFTs -- or nonfungible tokens, unique digital assets that have birthed a highly speculative marketplace riddled with gimmickry -- were released on Zigazoo, an app for children as young as 3 that bills itself as ''the world's largest social network and NFT platform for kids.''\par \par \uc2 Does your toddler need an NFT? Zigazoo says yes. The app's mission is to ''empower kids to shape the very landscape and infrastructure of NFTs and Web3,'' to help them ''express themselves through art and practice essential financial literacy skills'' and to allow them to grow into ''tomorrow's digital citizens.'' As Rebecca Jennings recently reported in \uc2 Vox\uc2 , efforts to usher children into the worlds of cryptocurrency, NFTs and \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology are being pitched as ''preparing future workers for lucrative jobs in tech.'' Traditional children's entertainment has long angled at extracting maximum cash from its little consumers (soon \uc2 Pixar\uc2  will release a gritty origin film featuring the ''Toy Story'' character Buzz Lightyear), but the slick language suggesting that kids should spend money to make money feels new. Platforms like Zigazoo are building a hype bubble for children and pitching it as a creative outlet, an educational opportunity, even a civic duty to join in.\par \par \uc2 Recently I practiced my own essential financial literacy skills by acquiring a set of images of Qai Qai dancing in a tutu. First I had to download Zigazoo, which is a kind of junior TikTok designed to be managed by an adult caregiver. Once you're inside, the app solicits videos built around anodyne ''challenges,'' like ''Can you sing in another language?,'' and not-too-personal questions, like ''What are your favorite shoes to wear?'' The content feels less important than the design of the app, which, like any grown-up social network, encourages users to amass followers, rack up likes and generally become Zigazoo-famous. In Zigazoo-ese, this might be translated as ''practicing essential attention economy skills.''\par \par \uc2 Many of the app's users appear charmingly unpolished, posting shaky videos that cut their faces off at their foreheads or chins as they deliver breathless extemporaneous monologues. And yet their dispatches are infused with the language of influencers; a typical video begins with ''Hey Zigazoo friends!'' and ends with ''Like and subscribe!'' Along the way there are apologies for not posting recently, promises to post more soon and offers to shout out the user's most engaged followers in the next post, even if those followers don't exist. Occasionally this strange and tender feed will be interrupted by an oddly glossy video -- like from a big-on-Zigazoo child actor who can execute his challenges while staring meaningfully into the lens and tickling a piano just out of frame. (When I signed up, Zigazoo suggested I follow him, along with an account associated with the ''Paw Patrol'' movie and a teenage ''Ninja Warrior'' champion.) Occasionally, adults will appear. Usually they are selling something, like a toy subscription box or a podcast for children.\par \par \uc2 Common Sense Media\uc2 , a nonprofit that rates the age appropriateness of media and technology, gives Zigazoo high marks for its lack of images of violence, drugs and ''sexy stuff.'' There are no comments on the app, only positive-reinforcement mechanisms, and each video is moderated by a human being. But though Common Sense's review states that consumerism is ''not present'' on the app, it is everywhere. Every time I opened Zigazoo, I learned that I had earned more ''Zigabucks,'' the platform's in-app currency, for dutifully visiting every day. Also, I was constantly prompted to care about Zigazoo's latest NFT drop: images featuring JJ, the cartoon infant star of CoComelon.\par \par \uc2 CoComelon is a wildly popular \uc2 YouTube\uc2  channel featuring crudely rendered C.G.I. videos and repetitive nursery rhymes, like ''Dentist Song'' and ''Pasta Song.'' Though it has no discernible value beyond its ability to hypnotize toddlers for long stretches of time, it has taken over the world; recently the brand partnered with the Saudi government to construct a physical CoComelon village in Riyadh, perhaps as a part of Saudi Arabia's larger public-relations effort to become known for something other than torturing dissidents. (Let's call that ''practicing essential geopolitical skills.'')\par \par \uc2 Anyway, children love it: The CoComelon NFTs were sold out before I could snag one, so I waited for the Qai Qai NFTs to drop, watching the countdown clock on the Zigazoo app for my moment to ''invest.'' Qai Qai's NFTs were selling for $5.99 to $49.99 a pack, with more cash buying you a higher likelihood of acquiring not just a ''common'' NFT but a ''rare'' or ''legendary'' one, a distinction that went unexplained. (Though every Zigazoo NFT is linked to a unique digital record on the Flow \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , the app did not make clear how many of these records it was assigning to each Qai Qai image, which makes it even harder to guess just how worthless it might be in the future.) I selected a ''rare'' pack of Qai Qai collectibles for $19.99, answered a ''Parents only!'' multiple-choice multiplication problem to prove I was an adult (although I knew my multiplication tables better when I was a kid), and ultimately was rewarded with four still images of Qai Qai and one ''rare'' repeating video of Qai Qai executing the ''Heel Toe Dance.''\par \par \uc2 Over the next few days, I was invited to trade my NFTs with other users and participate in NFT-related challenges like ''#QaiQaiDrop: What new toy are you hoping to get?'' and ''CoComelon: Can you show us your favorite pajamas?'' Each challenge's ''winner'' was rewarded with yet more NFTs. The real challenge in this case appears to be to ''express yourself by helping to hype a new tech gimmick to a younger class of consumers.'' This concluded my NFT education on Zigazoo.\par \par \uc2 My Qai Qai NFT is fine. Like the internet's many dancing babies before her, she is cute, and buying the digital asset also supports a broader project: Serena Williams developed Qai Qai in order to ensure that her daughter's generation has access to Black dolls, which Williams herself lacked as a child. (I have nothing nice to say about the CoComelon NFTs.) Dolls present endless opportunities for creative play, as exemplified by Qai Qai's macabre beginnings. Her early \uc2 Instagram\uc2  account exemplified the generative power of the internet, the ability to spin up a weird creative project and share it with the world -- not because it will help ''teach'' you how to invest in cryptocurrencies, but just because you feel like it.\par \par \uc2 In its in-app explainer, ''Why should kids have NFTs?,'' Zigazoo laments that ''so much about the internet is about consumption,'' but states that ''the future of the internet is what you can create.'' Right now, though, it's about what you can buy using Zigabucks.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Saehan Parc FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220428ei4r0000e\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 When Jeffrey Epstein died in jail in 2019, he took many secrets with him. One was how a sexual predator and college dropout managed to forge bonds with an astonishing number of the world's richest and most powerful men, like Britain's Prince Andrew and the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\par \par \uc2 Another was why Mr. Epstein owned a rare Italian cello. It was the only nonfinancial asset listed on his foundation's annual tax forms, described simply as ''cello'' and carried on the books at a value of $165,676.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Epstein had never played the cello or shown any interest in musical instruments as an investment.\par \par \uc2 The first mystery is large, and it is still being untangled by lawyers, victims and journalists. The second is seemingly small, contained to the rarefied world of fine string instruments. But the two mysteries are connected. And the cello's strange journey into and out of Mr. Epstein's possession offers a window into the notorious criminal's life and legacy.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Epstein's Manhattan mansion was filled with curiosities. There was a portrait of Bill Clinton in a blue dress, a stuffed giraffe, prosthetic breasts in the master bathroom.\par \par \uc2 But more than objects, Mr. Epstein collected people. Over the years he cultivated leaders in the fields of business, finance, politics, science, mathematics, academia, music, even yoga. He often cemented the relationships with introductions to others in his orbit, donations to causes they supported or other gifts and favors.\par \par \uc2 That is where the cello came in.\par \par \uc2 False Claims and Accordion Lessons\par \par \uc2 As a child growing up in Brooklyn, Mr. Epstein and his younger brother, Mark, showed an aptitude for music. Both began lessons on the saxophone, then switched to more difficult double-reed instruments. Jeffrey played the bassoon, Mark the oboe, both in high demand in orchestras and other ensembles. It was as a bassoonist that Jeffrey earned a scholarship in 1967 to Interlochen, the prestigious summer music camp nestled in the woods of northern Michigan. When his mother visited him that summer, he asked her to bring bagels.\par \par \uc2 As an adult, Mr. Epstein falsely claimed to have had a budding career as a concert pianist. And he claimed to have begun piano lessons at age 5, which Mark Epstein said in an interview was not true. (He took lessons on the accordion as a young boy.) Mr. Epstein later took piano lessons, but he never achieved more than a high-school level of proficiency.\par \par \uc2 It was the cello that became a recurring motif in Mr. Epstein's self-told life story, starting after he and a friend backpacked in Europe in the early 1970s. Among the stories Mr. Epstein later recounted was playing the piano for Jacqueline du Pr\u233\'00\'E9, the British cello virtuoso. In Mr. Epstein's telling, he met Ms. du Pr\u233\'00\'E9 in 1971 while visiting London. Ms. du Pr\u233\'00\'E9 enjoyed the patronage of Queen Elizabeth II, and it was through the cellist that Mr. Epstein said he'd gained access to members of the British royal family, forging an especially close friendship with Prince Andrew.\par \par \uc2 The tale was not entirely implausible. Ms. du Pr\u233\'00\'E9, who died in 1987, was still performing at the time Mr. Epstein visited London, where he bought a full-length fur coat that he wore for years afterward. But Ms. du Pr\u233\'00\'E9 hardly needed Mr. Epstein as an accompanist, since, among the world's countless other professional musicians, she was married to the celebrated pianist Daniel Barenboim.\par \par \uc2 At Interlochen, to which Mr. Epstein became a significant donor and regular visitor, he met and befriended a 14-year-old cellist, Melissa Solomon, in 1997. According to her account in a 2019 podcast, he insisted she apply to Juilliard and agreed to pay her tuition there. She said he never attempted to have sex with her (he did get her to massage his feet), but after she declined to attend a party with Prince Andrew, Mr. Epstein cut ties and stopped paying her tuition.\par \par \uc2 Another Interlochen student, identified only as Jane, testified in the recent trial of Mr. Epstein's closest associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Jane said that Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell began grooming her when she was a 13-year-old student at the camp and that Mr. Epstein subsequently raped her, all while promising to advance her career.\par \par \uc2 Thanksgiving at the Ranch\par \par \uc2 In the mid-1990s, Mr. Epstein showed up backstage at the Kravis Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., after a performance by the cellist William DeRosa, a young prodigy who'd made his concert debut with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at age 11. By the time Mr. Epstein saw him, Mr. DeRosa was regarded as one of the world's best cellists, performing at Carnegie Hall, on television and with leading symphony orchestras.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Epstein's and Mr. DeRosa's paths didn't cross again until around 2004, when Mr. DeRosa began dating a blond model named Kersti Ferguson.\par \par \uc2 Originally from Savannah, Ga., Ms. Ferguson said in an interview that she met Mr. Epstein through a mutual friend when she was 18. Ms. Ferguson and Mr. Epstein spent time at his Palm Beach estate, where she met Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Epstein invited Ms. Ferguson to his Virgin Islands estate while she was in college, and after she broke up with a boyfriend, Mr. Epstein flew her and her mother to his New Mexico ranch for Thanksgiving. He sometimes called her four times a day. He showed her photos of himself with what he said were his powerful friends, among them former President Bill Clinton, the \uc2 Microsoft\uc2  co-founder \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2 , the Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia.\par \par \uc2 After she began dating Mr. DeRosa, Mr. Epstein insisted on checking him out. ''Be nice,'' Mr. DeRosa recalled Mr. Epstein warning him. He seemed fascinated by Mr. DeRosa's musical talents. He once suggested they play together, but Mr. DeRosa brushed him off. He said he had never heard Mr. Epstein play the piano.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeRosa and Mr. Epstein discussed their shared admiration for Ms. du Pr\u233\'00\'E9, with whom Mr. DeRosa had spent a summer studying and living. Mr. DeRosa had a collection of every recording Ms. du Pr\u233\'00\'E9 had released, and he and Mr. Epstein sometimes listened to them together. When Mr. Epstein asked to borrow them, Mr. DeRosa obliged. (He said Mr. Epstein never returned them.)\par \par \uc2 In 2006, Mr. Epstein was arrested in Florida after investigators found evidence that he'd been sexually involved with girls. Ms. Ferguson said Mr. Epstein never suggested having sex with her or asked her to recruit other young women. On the contrary, when Ms. Ferguson attempted to hug him, he'd ''shrivel up,'' she said, as if afraid of catching a disease. And she thought he and Ms. Maxwell were in love, even though Mr. Epstein confided in Ms. Ferguson that he had no intention of marrying.\par \par \uc2 Rich and Powerful\par \par \uc2 For a time after his arrest, Ms. Ferguson didn't hear from him. Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute and was sentenced to 13 months in jail, though he was allowed to serve much of that time at home.\par \par \uc2 Then, in 2010, as Mr. Epstein was trying to reconstitute his orbit of the rich and powerful, he called her. ''I need to buy a cello,'' Mr. Epstein said abruptly, asking if she would enlist Mr. DeRosa in the search. When Mr. Epstein next spoke to Mr. DeRosa, he explained that he was buying a cello for a young Israeli cellist. ''Go find one,'' he ordered, then hung up.\par \par \uc2 At first Mr. DeRosa didn't take Mr. Epstein's command seriously. But Mr. Epstein kept calling, as did members of his staff, asking if he'd made any progress. Mr. DeRosa got to work tracking down a cello.\par \par \uc2 Like many professional musicians, Mr. DeRosa was wired into the small world of rare string instruments, a few of which command prices as high as $20 million. His own cello, made by the Italian master Domenico Montagnana in 1739, is considered one of the world's finest and is likely worth millions of dollars. Mr. DeRosa assured Mr. Epstein he wouldn't have to spend that much.\par \par \uc2 Soon after, Mr. DeRosa was visiting his mother in Los Angeles when he learned of a cello being sold there by a musician who recorded soundtracks for Hollywood studios. (Before that, the cello had been played by a member of the Indianapolis symphony orchestra.)\par \par \uc2 While not a Stradivarius or a Montagnana, this cello had a distinguished pedigree, and was manufactured by Ettore Soffritti, who worked in the string instrument center of Ferrara, Italy, from the late 1800s until his death in 1928. Benning Violins, the Los Angeles dealer, described the cello's sound as ''rich and powerful'' and said the instrument was ''suitable for the finest of cellists.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeRosa tried the cello. He was smitten. He said he considered it ''one of the greatest modern cellos in existence.'' (By ''modern'' he meant any produced after the Italian Renaissance.) With an asking price of $185,000, he also considered it a bargain.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Epstein seemed pleased when Mr. DeRosa told him he'd found something. He said the cello's intended recipient -- a young Israeli man named Yoed Nir -- had to test the instrument first. Mr. DeRosa knew nearly every up-and-coming cellist, but he had never heard of Mr. Nir.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeRosa had the cello on a trial basis, and Mr. Nir tested the instrument on a visit to Mr. DeRosa's mother's house in Los Angeles. Mr. Nir, who was about 30 years old and had dark, shoulder-length hair, which he tossed theatrically while playing, played some of Bach's unaccompanied cello suites. He had clearly had musical training (he was a graduate of the Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance), but Mr. DeRosa considered his playing unexceptional by his exacting standards. He could think of many young cellists more deserving of such an instrument. ''I thought it incredibly odd that Jeffrey had chosen this guy,'' Mr. DeRosa recalled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Nir approved of the instrument, and Mr. Epstein had his accountant, Richard Kahn, step in to negotiate the purchase from Benning Violins. Mr. Kahn obtained an appraisal, then bargained down the price to $165,000. (Mr. DeRosa, who felt like his reputation was on the line since he'd initiated the transaction, found this insulting.)\par \par \uc2 When Mr. Epstein refused to buy an economy class ticket to fly the instrument back to New York -- the usual method for transporting a valuable cello -- Mr. DeRosa sent him an angry email accusing him of being a cheapskate. ''I'm done,'' he told Mr. Epstein.\par \par \uc2 ''Why are you so agitated?'' Mr. Epstein responded.\par \par \uc2 'You Can't Treat Someone Like That'\par \par \uc2 Weeks later, when Mr. DeRosa was back in New York, Mr. Epstein's assistant called and said Mr. DeRosa should be at his house the next morning at exactly 7:30 a.m. There, Mr. Epstein gestured toward a large unopened cardboard box. Mr. DeRosa said he opened the package and verified that it was same cello he'd located in Los Angeles.\par \par \uc2 ''Did you make any money on the transaction?'' Mr. Epstein asked.\par \par \uc2 ''No,'' Mr. DeRosa answered, furious at the insinuation that he'd taken a cut.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Epstein walked out without further comment. ''He showed no interest in the cello,'' Mr. DeRosa recalled.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Ferguson was upset when she heard about the meeting. She called Mr. Epstein and chastised him. ''You can't treat someone like that,'' she said. He was unapologetic.\par \par \uc2 The money to buy the cello came from Mr. Epstein's foundation, and the purchase was reflected on its 2011 tax return. Mr. Kahn drew up an agreement in which the cello would be lent to Mr. Nir at no cost, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.\par \par \uc2 Not long after, the singer Judy Collins performed at the Caf\u233\'00\'E9 Carlyle. A positive review in \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  mentioned in passing that Ms. Collins had ''added a new element, a cellist, Yoed Nir.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Epstein and Ms. Ferguson subsequently papered over their disagreement, and she urged Mr. DeRosa to forgive him. When a valuable Stradivarius cello came on the market, Mr. Epstein offered to buy it for Mr. DeRosa's use. Mr. DeRosa had a unique connection to the instrument, since a foundation had previously owned it and lent it to him early in his career.\par \par \uc2 So confident was the seller that a deal would come together that Mr. DeRosa took possession of the instrument. But Mr. Epstein balked at the asking price of $14 million, refusing to pay more than $10 million, according to Mr. DeRosa. The deal unraveled, and Mr. DeRosa returned the cello. It later sold for more than the asking price, Mr. DeRosa said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeRosa Has Regrets\par \par \uc2 Mr. DeRosa and Ms. Ferguson were shocked in 2019 when Mr. Epstein was arrested and charged with sex trafficking. Ms. Ferguson couldn't reconcile the allegations with the man she thought she knew. Given his wealth and connections to powerful people, she figured he'd somehow get off the hook. She wrote him a letter in jail offering to visit and bring food. She never got a reply. On Aug. 10, Mr. Epstein died by suicide.\par \par \uc2 Several months later, Mr. DeRosa emailed Mr. Nir to find out what had happened to the Soffritti cello. Mr. Nir said only that he'd returned it. At the Epstein foundation's request, Mr. Nir had delivered the cello to a New York law firm in October 2019. Its case was broken, and the cello itself had suffered some damage, according to Mr. DeRosa. (Mr. Nir said the case wasn't broken when he returned it and that the instrument was ''in very good playing condition.'') The foundation asked Benning Violins to again market and sell it, and Benning agreed to supply a new case.\par \par \uc2 Wittingly or not, Mr. Epstein had made a sound investment. This time the price was $220,000 -- or 33 percent more than what Mr. Epstein had paid eight years earlier. With the backing of a financial partner whom Mr. DeRosa wouldn't identify, he took possession of the cello in early 2020, just before the coronavirus pandemic brought an end to live performances.\par \par \uc2 Like many people in Mr. Epstein's orbit, Mr. DeRosa now regrets ever getting tangled up with him and wishes he had kept the cello for himself. ''I wish I'd never let Jeffrey buy the cello,'' Mr. DeRosa said. ''I'm not a dealer. I'm a concert cellist. I was always angry at myself that I let it go.''\par \par \uc2 Back on the Market\par \par \uc2 Two years later, the Epstein cello was back on the market.\par \par \uc2 All of Mr. DeRosa's performances during the pandemic were canceled. An extra cello was a luxury he could no longer afford.\par \par \uc2 Julian Hersh, a cellist and co-founder of Darnton & Hersh violins in Chicago, thought the cello might be useful to a company he was starting with Jonathan Koh, a music faculty member at \uc2 University of California, Berkeley\uc2 . There Mr. Koh had witnessed Silicon Valley's fascination with the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , cryptocurrencies and nonfungible tokens. His idea was to market digital images of rare instruments, or fractional shares of them, as N.F.T.s, in some cases along with videos of professional musicians playing the instruments. He and Mr. Hersh reasoned that rare instruments were works of art, and if an N.F.T. for a work by the artist known as Beeple could sell at Christie's in 2020 for $69 million, why not a token for a rare instrument? Payment would be exclusively in cryptocurrency, adding to the allure for a new generation of investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hersh wasn't deterred by the cello's provenance. ''Jeffrey was horrible,'' he said. ''No question about it.'' But there was a clear title -- in other words, there was no dispute over the cello's ownership -- which was what really mattered to investors.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Hersh and Mr. Koh launched their new venture, called Musikhaus, in January. They described its mission as ''bridging the worlds of classical music with the rapidly evolving world of nonfungible tokens'' to ''make timeless digital collectibles.'' Among the first offerings was the Epstein cello.\par \par \uc2 The listing came just days after Ms. Maxwell's conviction for sex trafficking and conspiracy, which thrust the Epstein saga back into the news. Dealers and collectors grimaced at what seemed an attempt to capitalize on Mr. Epstein's notoriety. ''The timing was terrible,'' Mr. Hersh acknowledged. The Epstein connection ''was just too hot. I blame myself.''\par \par \uc2 At first Mr. Hersh removed the reference to Mr. Epstein from the cello's description, but he then decided the provenance shouldn't be concealed. He removed the listing from their website altogether. He hopes to re-list the Soffritti N.F.T. in the future. ''So what if Jeffrey owned it?'' Mr. Hersh said. ''It's still one of the best 20th-century cellos in the world.''\par \par \uc2 A Clue at the Cafe\par \par \uc2 The mystery persists: Why had Mr. Epstein bought the cello in the first place? What was his connection to Mr. Nir?\par \par \uc2 An important clue emerged at the 2011 Judy Collins concert at the Caf\u233\'00\'E9 Carlyle. Ms. Collins's longtime musical arranger and pianist, Russell Walden, recalled that one thing about the evening stuck in his memory. At the cafe, he met Mr. Nir's wife, Anat. Mr. Nir mentioned that she was the daughter of Mr. Barak, the former Israeli prime minister.\par \par \uc2 There are hardly any public references to Mr. Barak's children. Reached recently in Tel Aviv, he confirmed that Yoed and Anat Nir are his son-in-law and daughter.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Barak -- who was prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and later served in other high-ranking government jobs -- said that another former prime minister, Shimon Peres, introduced him to Mr. Epstein in 2003. Mr. Barak has said that he and Mr. Epstein met dozens of times but he ''never took part in any party or event with women or anything like that.''\par \par \uc2 Over the years Mr. Epstein wooed Mr. Barak by, among other things, investing $1 million in a limited partnership established by Mr. Barak in 2015.\par \par \uc2 He said he introduced Mr. Epstein to Mr. Nir in 2010 or 2011, though he didn't know that Mr. Epstein subsequently lent Mr. Nir the cello. Therefore, Mr. Barak said, it ''could not be true'' that Mr. Epstein used the cello loan to curry favor. A more likely explanation, he said, ''is that Mr. Epstein did it based on the reputation of Yoed as an extremely gifted cellist.'' (Asked if he'd ever told his father-in-law about the loan, Mr. Nir declined to answer.)\par \par \uc2 Nonetheless, the loan of a $165,000 cello was the kind of favor that Mr. Epstein might only have made known when he wanted something in return. After all, not just anybody had the resources and connections to source an extraordinary cello for the relative of a powerful political leader -- just the type of person that Mr. Epstein had a knack for keeping close.\par \par \uc2 Ronen Bergman contributed reporting.

\par\par \uc2 PETER COY\par \uc2 Sunday Review Desk; SECTSR\par \b \uc2 Bitcoin Is Unlikely to Go Green\b0\par\par\uc2 By Peter Coy \par \uc2 1,648 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 April 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The people behind Bitcoin, the No. 1 cryptocurrency by market value (and renown), are under heavy pressure to reduce its carbon footprint -- the planet-warming emissions from burning fossil fuels for electricity to run the network's computations, known as mining. I spoke with people on both sides of the argument and came away thinking that Bitcoin is highly unlikely to change its fundamental way of operating.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin feels wasteful to a lot of people because its security depends on buying lots of specialized computing hardware that's useless for any other purpose and then running it hard, which consumes joules and joules of electricity. The Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance calculates that Bitcoin mining, on the whole, consumes slightly more energy than gold mining, which is a fair comparison, since both Bitcoin tokens and gold are pitched as alternatives to fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar. Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity than Norway but slightly less than Egypt, the center says, and accounts for 0.62 percent of the world's total electricity consumption.\par \par \uc2 Here is a mind-blowing stat about Bitcoin: Every second, the Bitcoin network performs about 200 quintillion hashes, which are essentially guesses about a certain very long string of digits. There's a race among Bitcoin network participants, known as miners, to make guesses faster and faster so they can be first and win rewards in the form of Bitcoin. It's cheaper for them than buying Bitcoin on the open market: The token's price is up more than thirtyfold over the past five years.\par \par \uc2 As the miners get faster, the network automatically makes the problem they need to solve harder, essentially spinning the treadmill faster. The Bitcoin network was designed this way to limit the pace at which new blocks of verified data are formed to one every 10 minutes. Unlike with most other cryptocurrencies, there is a built-in ceiling on production of tokens. More than 90 percent of the 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist have already been mined, making each one more valuable.\par \par \uc2 Pressure on Bitcoin to switch to a less energy-intensive approach is coming from several directions. Ethereum, the No. 2 cryptocurrency, is switching from proof of work, which Bitcoin uses, to proof of stake, which requires much less computing power and therefore does less damage to the environment. Briefly, you prove your work by doing those quintillions of calculations. You prove your stake by pledging cryptocoins that you own. As in a company's shareholder vote, the people with the most coins have the biggest say.\par \par \uc2 The difference in energy consumed per transaction between the two systems is like the difference in height between the world's tallest building and a single screw, according to one creative comparison. Once Ethereum makes the switch, Bitcoin will be the only one of the most highly valued cryptocurrencies using proof of work.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  is moving toward insisting that all cryptocurrencies meet environmental sustainability standards, although in March a draft document stopped short of banning the proof-of-work system that Bitcoin uses. Also in March, Greenpeace USA, the \uc2 Environmental Working Group\uc2 , and other environmental advocacy groups began the Change the Code campaign, which involves advertising as well as putting pressure on cryptocurrency fanboys like \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  of \uc2 Tesla\uc2  and \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2  of Block (formerly Square), as well as \uc2 Abigail Johnson\uc2  of \uc2 Fidelity Investments\uc2 , which manages mutual funds that invest in Bitcoin miners. The campaign got a $5 million boost from \uc2 Chris Larsen\uc2 , the executive chairman, a former chief executive and a co-founder of \uc2 Ripple\uc2 , a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company for global enterprises.\par \par \uc2 There is no Bitcoin headquarters that you can call for an official response on this matter. Jameson Lopp, one of the currency's defenders I spoke with, said, ''There is no official anything when it comes to Bitcoin. There is no leader. There is only the protocol.''\par \par \uc2 Lopp, a co-founder and the chief technology officer of the Bitcoin storage company \uc2 Casa\uc2 , who describes himself as a professional cypherpunk, said it wasn't up to people like him to defend Bitcoin. ''I believe it defends itself. The game theory and the incentives are what keep this working. People can scream about environmental concerns all day long, but until you come up with a better system, it's going to keep going.''\par \par \uc2 He and others also argue that Bitcoin isn't as much of an energy hog as it first appears. Because Bitcoin miners can rapidly turn on or off, they are stabilizing the electrical grid in places such as Texas by throttling back when other demand is high and cranking up consumption when other demand is weak, advocates argue. Some of the electricity that Bitcoin uses is from energy resources that nobody else can easily access, such as overbuilt hydroelectric power plants, they say. (There's some truth to this, but Bitcoin mining still contributes to global warming.)\par \par \uc2 Another Bitcoiner argument is that its proof of work method is more secure than proof of stake or other protocols. ''The open question is not whether proof of stake is secure but whether it's secure enough for a global form of digital gold. Bitcoin is,'' said Ryan Selkis, a co-founder and the chief executive of Messari, which builds data and research tools for crypto. (Backers of proof-of-stake cryptos respond that their systems are just as secure as Bitcoin's. ''They're literally being attacked by every hacker on earth, constantly. And they're holding up,'' said Larsen.)\par \par \uc2 There's also some bad blood between the Bitcoin community and Larsen, whose company, \uc2 Ripple\uc2 , uses a security system that isn't proof of work or proof of stake. In March, Selkis called Larsen a ''Judas'' on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . The \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  sued \uc2 Ripple\uc2 , Larsen, and another \uc2 Ripple\uc2  executive in 2020, charging that its sale of $1.3 billion in crypto tokens constituted an ''unregistered, ongoing digital asset securities offering.'' In an interview, Larsen said he thinks the S.E.C. is wrong because \uc2 Ripple\uc2  is a virtual currency and is thus exempt from securities regulation.\par \par \uc2 Make of those arguments what you will; the important fact is that there's no evidence that the key players in Bitcoin are interested in making the big switch to energy-saving proof of stake. It wouldn't benefit the miners, who have invested heavily in specialized computing technology that would go to waste. And there's no groundswell for it in the other key interest group, the operators of nodes -- computers that keep up-to-date digital records of crypto transactions. The node operators collectively decide whether each new block of transactions should or should not be legitimized and appended to the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . Some fear that moving to proof of stake would diminish Bitcoin's decentralization, which they value.\par \par \uc2 It's possible that some Bitcoiners will decide to switch to proof of stake. That would be what the community calls a hard fork, as in a fork in the road, where people have to choose which direction to go. But ''even if there is a fork, that fork will eventually fail, and it will have zero or close to zero economic value,'' said Daniel Frumkin, the director of research at Braiins, a Bitcoin-mining software company that operates a network of miners called Slush Pool.\par \par \uc2 For Bitcoin to change direction would require ''almost like a constitutional convention of sorts,'' said Selkis. ''Inertia usually wins.''\par \par \uc2 OK, but what if the \uc2 European Parliament\uc2  does ban proof of work someday and the United States and other nations follow suit? That's the nightmare scenario for the Bitcoin community, which has a strong libertarian streak. ''Bitcoin would not be a trillion-dollar asset if the \uc2 European Union\uc2  and the United States were doing their jobs'' of maintaining sound money, Selkis said. ''That's the real reason they don't like it. It exposes their underperformance.''\par \par \uc2 ''At least as of today, there is no one world, global government,'' said Lopp. ''There will always be somewhere that these miners will be able to go.'' He laughed and added, ''Worst-case scenario, they could all go to El Salvador, which loves Bitcoin.'' (El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as an official currency in September, though the experiment has had some hiccups.)\par \par \uc2 I see lots of reasons for Bitcoin to stick with its current game plan. Quintillions of reasons, actually.\par \par \uc2 Elsewhere\par \par \uc2 Why do so many people of prime working age -- 25 to 54 -- remain out of the labor force, even though the Covid pandemic has eased and employers are dangling big pay hikes? A working paper calculates that increased substance abuse accounted for 9 to 26 percent of the decline in labor force participation at prime ages between February 2020 and June 2021. A \uc2 New York Times\uc2  article in March 2020 described the pandemic recession as a ''national relapse trigger.'' People without college degrees are more likely to abuse opioids and methamphetamine and have dropped out of the labor force at a higher rate, says the study, which is by Jeremy Greenwood of the \uc2 University of Pennsylvania\uc2 , Nezih Guner of \uc2 Autonomous University of Barcelona\uc2  and Karen Kopecky of the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Quote of the day\par \par \uc2 ''I found myself with unpredictable and small chunks of time during which I either collapsed from exhaustion and frustration, or ruminated over the excruciating monotony of making and selling sandwiches, and worried about how I might pay my rent with the nickels they gave me in exchange for my ennui.''\par \par \uc2 -- MacKenzie Scott, now a billionaire philanthropist, in a letter to the novelist Toni Morrison in September 1992, shortly after graduating from college\par \par \uc2 Have feedback?

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The venture capitalists are sounding the alarm.\par \par \uc2 At posh conferences, they buzz about falling valuations for start-ups. On CNBC, they bemoan the sudden lack of initial public offerings. On \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , they warn of a coming downturn.\par \par \uc2 It is a familiar refrain. For the past decade, such warnings have cropped up repeatedly in start-up land. The industry is in another bubble, investors and commentators caution, conjuring the 1999 dot-com era and the dramatic collapse and recession that followed. Jobs disappeared, fortunes vaporized, and reputations were tarnished.\par \par \uc2 The message since has carried those scars: The boom times are ending. Buckle in for a rough ride.\par \par \uc2 Yet every time, more money has flooded into start-ups. Instead of a collapse, things got bubblier.\par \par \uc2 It started in 2011, when a tiny, elite group of start-ups attained ''unicorn'' status, with valuations of $1 billion or more.\par \par \uc2 Investors poured billions into start-ups each month; and hyped-up initial public offerings from \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2 , Pandora, \uc2 Zynga\uc2  and \uc2 Groupon\uc2  fueled fears of a bubble.\par \par \uc2 Steve Blank\par \par \uc2 Entrepreneur\par \par \uc2 ''We're now in the second Internet bubble. The signals are loud and clear.''\par \par \uc2 Lise Buyer\par \par \uc2 Founder of Class V Group\par \par \uc2 ''Yes, we have a frenzy again.''\par \par \uc2 The warnings didn't stick. Investors pumped $45 billion into U.S. start-ups that year.\par \par \uc2 Sean Parker\par \par \uc2 Entrepreneur and investor\par \par \uc2 ''I don't know how many more years of this we have -- maybe it's a year, a year or two, max.''\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  went public in May 2012 with the largest-ever tech I.P.O. in the United States. Many viewed its valuation -- more than $100 billion for a start-up with less than $4 billion in revenue -- as a sign that tech valuations had ballooned out of control.\par \par \uc2 CNBC\par \par \uc2 Is the \uc2 Facebook\uc2  I.P.O. the Start of Another Tech Bubble?\par \par \uc2 NPR\par \par \uc2 Facebook\uc2  I.P.O.: Worth the Price or Next Internet Bubble?\par \par \uc2 The bubble they had warned of never burst.\par \par \uc2 Reuters\par \par \uc2 Web Start-Ups: The Dot-Com Bubble All Over Again?\par \par \uc2 Things sure felt bubbly. Engineers were demanding \uc2 Tesla\uc2  sports cars just for showing up to work, \uc2 Business Insider\uc2  presented as evidence.\par \par \uc2 The New York Times\par \par \uc2 If It Looks Like a Bubble and Floats Like a Bubble ...\par \par \uc2 By 2014, the number of unicorns around the world topped 90.\par \par \uc2 Marc Andreessen\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist\par \par \uc2 ''Many high burn rate co's will VAPORIZE. ... Worry.''\par \par \uc2 The Wall Street Journal\par \par \uc2 Venture Capitalist Sounds Alarm on Start-Up Investing\par \par \uc2 Start-up investing rewards risk taking. Many of the most audacious, irrational investors have won by doubling down in a market frenzy. The cautious ones, trifling over such small-minded concerns as high prices or cash burn? Less so.\par \par \uc2 Suddenly \uc2 Uber\uc2  -- a little taxi app -- was worth $51 billion. More than \uc2 American Airlines\uc2  or \uc2 FedEx\uc2 , which actually turned profits. Investors blasted the alarm even louder.\par \par \uc2 Bill Gurley\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist\par \par \uc2 ''You'll see some dead unicorns this year.''\par \par \uc2 Mark Cuban\par \par \uc2 Investor\par \par \uc2 ''This tech bubble is worse than the tech bubble of 2000''\par \par \uc2 The warnings were not all wrong -- a few unicorns did perish. (Remember \uc2 Fab.com\uc2  and Jawbone?)\par \par \uc2 But for every flameout, there were many more new ideas to back. New sources of capital -- including private equity, mutual funds and sovereign wealth funds -- began chasing unicorn investments. In May 2016, they poured $14.2 billion into more than 800 deals, the highest amount of the decade so far.\par \par \uc2 Keith Rabois\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist\par \par \uc2 ''We're more back in the fear mode than the greed mode.''\par \par \uc2 Jim Breyer\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist\par \par \uc2 There is ''blood in the water''; 90 percent of unicorns will be repriced or die.\par \par \uc2 Just in case the warnings were right, some investors lowered the valuations of their biggest investments, briefly cooling the unicorn frenzy. There was talk of onerous funding terms and start-up layoffs.\par \par \uc2 TechCrunch\par \par \uc2 The Top Unicorns Are Overvalued\par \par \uc2 Then \uc2 Masayoshi Son\uc2  arrived.\par \par \uc2 Masayoshi Son\par \par \uc2 SoftBank\uc2  chief executive\par \par \uc2 ''We only live once, so I want to think big. I have no intention of making small bets.''\par \par \uc2 The brazen investor dumped $100 billion into Silicon Valley start-ups -- dwarfing the rest of the venture capital market -- at a pace that averaged $100 million a day. Reuters called him a ''one-man bubble maker.'' Executives joked nervously about Mr. Son's ''capital cannon.'' \uc2 Venture\uc2  capital firms raised bigger funds to keep up.\par \par \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 !\par \par \uc2 MoviePass!\par \par \uc2 WeWork\uc2 !\par \par \uc2 Scooters!\par \par \uc2 High valuations and obscene spending became the norm. Start-ups prized growth over profits. Investors gave up on their bubble talk. Fear went out the window. Everyone decided to enjoy the party.\par \par \uc2 Research Affiliates\par \par \uc2 Yes. It's a Bubble. So What?\par \par \uc2 Annie Lamont\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist\par \par \uc2 ''The fear of a correction is not occurring.''\par \par \uc2 Quartz\par \par \uc2 Investors Have Never Cared Less Whether an I.P.O. Makes Money\par \par \uc2 Venture funding soared, topping $26.9 billion in December and hitting a new yearly high of $143 billion. The unicorn count jumped to 348, according to PitchBook, which tracks the venture industry.\par \par \uc2 The Financial Times\par \par \uc2 Loss-Making Tech Companies Are Floating Like It's 1999\par \par \uc2 In the lead-up to its I.P.O., \uc2 WeWork\uc2  imploded. It was the kind of spectacular, embarrassing, humbling disaster that many thought would have ripple effects for years to come.\par \par \uc2 In boardrooms, investors murmured that this was really, truly, finally the end. On conference stages, start-up founders promised to ''pivot to profits.''\par \par \uc2 Travis VanderZanden\par \par \uc2 Chief executive of Bird\par \par \uc2 It is now difficult for ''a growth-at-all-costs company burning hundreds of millions of dollars with negative unit economics'' to get funding.\par \par \uc2 Then the pandemic hit. Prepare for tough times ahead, venture firms declared. For real this time.\par \par \uc2 That lasted barely a few weeks. Start-ups flourished in the pandemic and funding soared to new heights. I.P.O.s roared back. So, naturally, did the bubble talk.\par \par \uc2 Eric Paley\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalist\par \par \uc2 ''The party is as loud and the drinks are flowing as freely as the dot-com boom, despite that we're all drinking at home and alone.''\par \par \uc2 Rich Steinberg\par \par \uc2 Market strategist\par \par \uc2 ''It's silly season.''\par \par \uc2 More than 500 start-ups around the world topped $1 billion valuations. Those in the U.S. raised $164 billion in 2020, setting yet another record.\par \par \uc2 Meme stocks! Crypto! NFTs! SPACs! The \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  was printing money, interest rates were low, vaccines were available, and the world was set to reopen. By 2021, economists began predicting a new Roaring Twenties led by tech prosperity.\par \par \uc2 Yeah, it's probably a bubble, investors shrugged. But YOLO, amirite?\par \par \uc2 CNBC\par \par \uc2 'This Feels Like 1999': Global Start-Up Funding Frenzy Fuels Fears of a Bubble\par \par \uc2 Jeremy Grantham\par \par \uc2 Investment manager\par \par \uc2 ''This bubble will burst in due time.''\par \par \uc2 This year, fear crept in again, as interest rates were set to rise, inflation surged, and war broke out. Soon, tech stocks tanked. Initial public offerings screeched to a halt. Start-up investments fell.\par \par \uc2 A sense of caution returned. Was the bubble finally, really, truly bursting?\par \par \uc2 Today's warnings are different from those of the last decade. Investors tiptoe around the word ''bubble,'' referring instead to a ''recalibration,'' a ''pullback'' or even a gentle ''softening.'' The people who once called for caution grew tired of being wrong, and their audiences became numb to the warnings. Every time the alarm bells rang, more money poured into start-ups.\par \par \uc2 ''This time is different'' used to be a morbid joke among investors; now people believe it. Tech is too enmeshed in our lives, the thinking goes, and the dot-com bubble is too far in the rear view. This decade-long start-up boom has surged in the face of so many scares, each time amassing even more money and power. Maybe it really is different this time.\par \par \uc2 Some investors believe market euphorias are a good -- even necessary -- thing for progress. Without all that attention and excitement, how can a start-up founder convince workers and investors to help turn their crazy moonshot ideas into reality? Sure, most of the people who flock to a bubble are in it for the money. And yes, things can get messy. But underneath, it's all moving forward. Out of the dot-com ashes, techies like to remind us, grew \uc2 Amazon\uc2 , \uc2 PayPal\uc2  and \uc2 eBay\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Even as the biggest factor driving investors to high-growth start-ups over the last decade -- low interest rates -- begin to change, even as economists worry about an impending recession and even as start-ups lower their valuations or suddenly run out of cash, few today are predicting a total collapse.\par \par \uc2 A decade of talking about a bubble that never burst will do that.\par \par \uc2 (BU8-BU9) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220424ei4o00039\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Not the usual one about his imprisonment on 10 counts of securities fraud and money laundering: This time, he'd been the victim. Last fall, he explained to a group of businessmen gathered at his palatial home, a hacker had stolen $300,000 of digital tokens from his cryptocurrency wallet.\par \par \uc2 He had gotten the bad news at dinner on a Friday, he said, while he was telling a venture-capitalist friend about the time he sank his yacht during a drug-fueled romp in the mid-90s. After breaking into Mr. Belfort's account, the hacker transferred large quantities of Ohm, a popular cryptocurrency token, to a separate wallet -- a publicly visible transaction Mr. Belfort could do nothing to reverse. ''You can see where the money is,'' he said. ''It's the most frustrating thing.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Belfort, 59, is best known for ''The Wolf of Wall Street,'' a tell-all memoir about his debauched 1990s career in high finance, which the director Martin Scorsese adapted into a 2013 movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio as the hard-partying protagonist. These days, the real-life Mr. Belfort is a consultant and sales coach, charging tens of thousands of dollars for private sessions.\par \par \uc2 This month, at his house in Miami Beach, he hosted nine \uc2 blockchain\uc2  enthusiasts and entrepreneurs for a weekend-long crypto workshop -- a chance to hang out with the Wolf and enjoy an ''intimate financial experience'' with his crypto-industry friends.\par \par \uc2 A long line of celebrities has tried to profit from the cryptocurrency boom, appearing in widely mocked crypto commercials or flogging nonfungible tokens, the unique digital collectibles known as NFTs. Mr. Belfort said he had refused to participate in the worst of the shilling. He has declined offers to launch a line of Wolf-themed NFTs, he said, even though ''I could easily make $10 million.''\par \par \uc2 He is also a recent convert away from crypto skepticism. Not long ago, he shot a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video about the dangers of Bitcoin, which he called ''frickin' insanity'' and ''mass delusion.'' Over the years, he said, he gradually changed his mind, as he learned more about cryptocurrencies and prices skyrocketed.\par \par \uc2 Now, Mr. Belfort is an investor in a handful of start-ups, including a new NFT platform and an animal-themed crypto project that he said was ''trying to take the dog-and-pet ecosystem and put it onto the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Whatever his crypto bona fides, Mr. Belfort is unquestionably qualified to discuss the subject of financial fraud, a major problem in the digital-asset industry. In the 1990s, the firm he founded, \uc2 Stratton Oakmont\uc2 , operated a sophisticated stock-manipulation scheme. At the height of their wealth, he and his business partners consumed enormous quantities of cocaine and quaaludes and regularly employed prostitutes. Mr. Belfort eventually served 22 months in prison.\par \par \uc2 Given that history, it can feel slightly surreal to hear an older, more grizzled Mr. Belfort proclaim that he is ''massively looking forward to regulation'' in the crypto industry. ''I'm not interested in separating people from their money,'' he said. ''That's the opposite of how I act right now.''\par \par \uc2 Still, the crypto workshop at his house was not free: Guests paid one Bitcoin for a seat, or the cash equivalent, which is roughly $40,000.\par \par \uc2 The workshop began at 9 a.m. on Saturday. The guests -- chosen from a pool of more than 600 applicants -- milled around Mr. Belfort's backyard, eating made-to-order omelets and trading tips about Bitcoin mining and tokenomics. A crypto miner from Kazakhstan relaxed in the sun with an aspiring \uc2 blockchain\uc2  influencer who runs a roofing company in Idaho. A Florida businessman explained his plan to use NFTs in a start-up that he's pitching as Tinder for music. Some of the guests said they had paid for the workshop because they were die-hard fans of the Wolf; others simply wanted to network with fellow entrepreneurs.\par \par \uc2 By 9:15 a.m., the mimosas were flowing, but Mr. Belfort was nowhere to be seen. ''The U.S. dollar is going to crap,'' said the roofing executive, Doug Bartlett. A few minutes passed. Still no Wolf. ''The Wolf is still sleeping?'' one guest wondered aloud.\par \par \uc2 At last, Mr. Belfort emerged from the house, wearing faded jeans and dark sunglasses. Mr. Belfort has short dark hair; he's more wrinkled than he was in the '90s, but his face is still set in a perpetually boyish grin. He stopped on the staircase down from the porch to survey the scene: nine men dressed in various shades of business casual -- polo shirts, flip-flops, untucked button-down shirts.\par \par \uc2 ''I guess we still need to work on feminine adoption of cryptocurrency,'' he said. ''We got to get some girls here next year.'' He paused. ''Women.''\par \par \uc2 Someone handed Mr. Belfort a can of \uc2 Red Bull\uc2 . (It was about 9:30 a.m.) ''I'm gonna need the sugar,'' he said. After a few minutes of chitchat, he ushered the group into the dining room, where each place at the table was set with a notebook and a copy of ''Way of the Wolf,'' a sales manual Mr. Belfort published in 2017.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Belfort has spent the past two decades trying to rebuild his reputation, but signs of the old Wolf were everywhere. Behind his spot at the head of the table, a fully stocked liquor shelf took up most of the wall. (He hasn't gotten high in 25 years, he said, but he sometimes drinks.) Next to the shelf hung a poster designed to resemble an entry on the periodic table -- Qu for quaalude -- listing various ''drug facts,'' including ''best sex ever.''\par \par \uc2 After a round of introductions, Mr. Belfort began a lecture on the minutiae of cryptocurrencies, from the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum to the rise of decentralized autonomous organizations. He shared his wisdom on crypto-based ''smart contract'' systems (''some of them are really smart; some of them are stupid'') and recounted old stories about his collaboration with Leo and Marty.\par \par \uc2 ''Leo had never done drugs,'' he said. ''I had to educate him on that.''\par \par \uc2 For a gathering of crypto evangelists, it was striking how much time everyone spent reliving his biggest losses. Nearly half the group said they'd been hacked. One guest said he'd lost money when the cryptocurrency exchange \uc2 Mt. Gox\uc2  collapsed in 2014. Two others said they'd burned large quantities of tokens in risky trades.\par \par \uc2 The energy in the room lifted with the arrival of Chase Hero, one of a series of guest speakers Mr. Belfort had recruited for the weekend. A crypto investor and gaming enthusiast, Mr. Hero declared that stablecoins -- cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the U.S. dollar -- were ''the biggest innovation since sliced bread.''\par \par \uc2 ''It seems vivacious and insane and almost borderline a Ponzi scheme,'' Mr. Hero said of his favorite stablecoin project. ''Which makes it the perfect asset for cryptocurrency because that's what these kids love.''\par \par \uc2 One of Mr. Belfort's guests, Svein-Erik Nilsen, a Norwegian entrepreneur, started describing his own business ambitions. Did Mr. Hero have any tips? The key to starting a new venture, he replied, is aggressive marketing to stand out from the crowd. ''\uc2 Imagine\uc2  going to a Brazilian beach and trying to find one single hot chick. There's eight million,'' Mr. Hero said. ''The idea is the same thing here. You have to do stupid, dumb marketing to get it out there.''\par \par \uc2 A few hours later, the group adjourned for dinner at Carbone, a high-end Italian restaurant in Miami Beach where Mr. Belfort eats as often as twice a week. As they dined on caviar and rigatoni, some of the guests shared stories of their own debauchery; Mr. Belfort, it turned out, was not the only wolf in the room. Two guests discussed the mechanics of pursuing younger women without risking entanglement in a ''sugar baby'' situation. Someone speculated about how an enterprising strip club owner might incorporate NFTs into the business.\par \par \uc2 Soon conversation turned to a club in Japan where women are said to cavort with octopuses. Mr. Belfort wanted to know more: Were the women in Japan beautiful? Later, he showed the group an iPhone video he took at an S-and-M-themed bar, where the waitresses flog the customers.\par \par \uc2 Artem Bespaloff, the chief executive of the crypto mining company Asic Jungle, leaned across the table to describe his personal conversion to the way of the Wolf. He was planning to go to medical school, he said, when he found a copy of ''The Wolf of Wall Street'' at the library.\par \par \uc2 ''I said, 'This is what I want to do,''' Mr. Bespaloff recalled. ''I ended up stealing the book from the library.''\par \par \uc2 ''So I was a good influence,'' Mr. Belfort said with a laugh. Still, he said, he regrets his behavior in those days -- it was wrong, and he could have gotten even richer if he hadn't broken the law. ''I missed the internet boom,'' he said. ''I would've made 100x more money.''\par \par \uc2 ''Well,'' Mr. Bespaloff replied, ''you're in crypto now.''\par \par \uc2 ''You live and learn,'' Mr. Belfort said.\par \par \uc2 Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.\par \par \uc2 Audio produced by Adrienne Hurst.\par \par \uc2 (B1); Clockwise from top, Jordan Belfort, center, hosting \uc2  enthusiasts at his home for a workshop, which cost roughly $40,000; copies of his sales manual; a quaaludes poster, a sign of his old drug-fueled Wolf persona; and Mr. Belfort, right, chatting with a guest.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Energy Fixes Exist. But They Need Money.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eshe Nelson and Adam Satariano \par \uc2 1,650 \uc2 words\par \uc2 19 April 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 LONDON -- When Jakob Bitner was 7, he left Russia for Germany with his parents and sister. Twenty-eight years later, he is set on solving a vexing green-energy problem that could help Germany end its dependence on imported energy from Russia, or anywhere.\par \par \uc2 The problem: how to make wind and solar energy available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, even if the sun is not shining or the wind not blowing.\par \par \uc2 The company that Mr. Bitner co-founded in Munich in 2016, VoltStorage, found some success selling storage battery packs for solar power to homeowners in Europe. Now the company is developing much larger batteries -- each about the size of a shipping container -- based on a chemical process that can store and discharge electricity over days, not just hours like today's most popular battery technology.\par \par \uc2 These ambitions to overcome the unreliable nature of renewable energy fit perfectly with Europe's targets to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. But Mr. Bitner's company is facing a frustrating reality that threatens to undercut Europe's plans and poses a wider challenge in the global fight against climate change: a lack of money to finish the job.\par \par \uc2 VoltStorage needs ''significantly'' more money to develop its new battery technology, Mr. Bitner said. In 2020 and 2021, the company raised 11 million euros, or $12 million. Now, it is trying to raise up to \u8364\'20\'AC40 million more by this summer.\par \par \uc2 ''Even though we had great early-stage investors from Germany and Europe that keep supporting us, it becomes very hard to raise the tickets we need right now,'' Mr. Bitner said, referring to individual investments.\par \par \uc2 Europe offers a preview for the rest of the world. The \uc2 European Union\uc2  has aggressive targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and there is broad political support for tackling climate change. The bloc has poured public money into grants for developing new technology.\par \par \uc2 But after getting initial start-up money or grant funding, businesses are struggling to raise funds for the kind of innovative, large-scale projects needed to complete the transition from carbon-spewing sources of energy. The funding gap means Europeans face the prospect of either falling short of ambitious climate targets or facing further energy shortages and rising costs.\par \par \uc2 Solutions are available if given a financial boost, experts said. Almost half the reductions in emissions to meet net-zero targets by 2050 will come from technologies currently in their infancy, according to the \uc2 International Energy Agency\uc2 . There is, in theory, plenty of capital available globally for the multitrillion-dollar task of funding this transition to greener energy.\par \par \uc2 The war in Ukraine has made Europe's energy transition even more urgent. The \uc2 European Union\uc2  has said it will cut imported Russian natural gas by two-thirds this year and completely by the end of the decade. While some of that supply will be made up by imports from other countries, such as the United States and Qatar, expanding domestic renewable energy capacity is a critical pillar to this plan.\par \par \uc2 But attracting investors to projects trying to move beyond mature technologies like solar and wind power is tough. Venture capitalists, once cheerleaders of green energy, are more infatuated with cryptocurrencies and start-ups that deliver groceries and beer within minutes. Many investors are put off by capital-intensive investments. And governments have further muddied the water with inconsistent policies that undermine their bold pledges to reduce carbon emissions.\par \par \uc2 Venture capitalists' other interests\par \par \uc2 Tony Fadell\uc2 , who spent most of his career trying to turn emerging technologies into mainstream products as an executive at \uc2 Apple\uc2  and founder of Nest, said that even as the world faced the risks of climate change, money was flooding into less urgent developments in cryptocurrency, the so-called metaverse and the digital art collections sold as NFTs. Last year, venture capitalists invested $11.9 billion in renewable energy globally, compared with $30.1 billion in cryptocurrency and \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , according to PitchBook.\par \par \uc2 Of the $106 billion invested by venture capitalists in European start-ups last year, just 4 percent went into energy investments, according to PitchBook.\par \par \uc2 ''We need to get real,'' said Mr. Fadell, who now lives in Paris and has proposed ideas on energy policy to the French government. ''Too many people are investing in the things that are not going to fix our existential problems. They are just investing in fast money.''\par \par \uc2 It has not helped that the industry has been burned before by a green tech boom. About 15 years ago, environmentally conscious start-ups were seen as the next big thing in Silicon Valley. One of the premier venture capital firms, \uc2 Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers\uc2 , made former Vice President \uc2 Al Gore\uc2  a partner and pledged that clean energy would eventually make up at least a third of its total investments.Instead, Kleiner became a cautionary tale about the risks of investing in energy-related companies as the firm missed out on early backing of social media companies like \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There is evidence that these old fears are receding. Two years ago 360 Capital, a venture capital firm based in Paris and Milan dealing in early-stage investment, introduced a dedicated fund investing in clean energy and sustainability companies. The firm is now planning to open up the fund to more investors, expanding it to \u8364\'20\'AC150 million from a \u8364\'20\'AC30 million fund.\par \par \uc2 There are a growing number of dedicated funds for energy investments. But even then there is a tendency for the companies in them to be software developers, deemed less risky than builders of larger-scale energy projects. Four of the seven companies backed by 360 Capital's new fund are artificial intelligence companies and software providers.\par \par \uc2 Still, the situation has changed completely since the company's first major green-energy investment in 2008, Fausto Boni, the firm's founder, said. ''We see potentially lots of money coming into the sector, and so many of the issues we had 15 years ago are on their way to being overcome,'' he said. But the availability of bigger investments needed to help companies expand in Europe still lags behind, he added.\par \par \uc2 The funding gap\par \par \uc2 Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, which is backed by \uc2 Bill Gates\uc2 , is trying to fill the gap. It was formed in late 2021 to help move promising technology from development to commercial use. In Europe, it is a $1 billion initiative with the \uc2 European Commission\uc2  and \uc2 European Investment Bank\uc2  to support four types of technologies -- long-duration energy storage, clean hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuels and direct air capture of carbon dioxide -- that it believes need to scale quickly.\par \par \uc2 In Europe, there are ''significant difficulties with the scaling-up phase,'' said Ann Mettler, the vice president for Europe at Breakthrough Energy and a former director general at the \uc2 European Commission\uc2 . There is money for start-ups, but when companies become reasonably successful and a bit larger, they are often acquired by American or Chinese companies, she said. This leaves fewer independent companies in Europe focused on the energy problems they set out to solve.\par \par \uc2 Companies that build complex -- and often expensive -- hardware, like Mr. Bitner's batteries for long-duration energy storage, have an especially hard time finding investors willing to stomach the risks. After a few investment rounds, the companies are too big for early-stage investors but too small to appeal to institutional investors looking for safer places to park large amounts of cash.\par \par \uc2 ''If you look at typical climate technologies, such as wind and solar and even the lithium-ion batteries, they took well over four decades to go from the early R&D to the large-scale commercialization and cost competitiveness,'' Ms. Mettler said, referring to research and development. ''Four decades -- which obviously we don't have.''\par \par \uc2 What investors want\par \par \uc2 There are some signs of improvement, including more funds focused on clean energy or sustainability and more companies securing larger investment rounds. But there is a sense of frustration as investors, companies and European governments agree that innovation and adoption of new technology need to happen much more quickly to reduce carbon emissions sharply by 2030.\par \par \uc2 ''You won't find a place in the world that is more attuned to what is needed than Europe,'' Ms. Mettler said. ''It's not for lack of ambition or vision -- it's difficult.''\par \par \uc2 But investors say government policy can help them more. Despite climate pledges, the regulations and laws in place haven't created strong enough incentives for investments in new technologies.\par \par \uc2 Industries like steel and concrete have to be forced to adopt greener methods of production, Mr. Boni, the 360 Capital founder, said.\par \par \uc2 For energy storage, hydrogen, nuclear power and other large-scale projects, the government should expedite permitting, cut taxes and provide matching funds, said Mr. Fadell, who has put his personal fortune into Future Shape, which backs start-ups addressing societal challenges.\par \par \uc2 ''There are few investors willing to go all in to put up $200 million or $300 million,'' Mr. Fadell said. ''We need to know the government is on our side.''\par \par \uc2 A prototype battery at VoltStorage in Munich.

\par\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 Reframing NFTs For the Art Market\b0\par\par\uc2 By Zachary Small \par \uc2 980 \uc2 words\par \uc2 16 April 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 An upcoming auction by \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  is the latest attempt to recast crypto collectibles as an artistic evolution and perhaps draw interest from a wider circle of collectors.\par \par \uc2 When digital artworks started selling for millions of dollars last year, the shock of pixelated punks and computerized graphics turned some traditional collectors into crypto skeptics.\par \par \uc2 The argument that NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, represented the art market's future was unappealing to the bulk of these buyers, leaving gallerists and auctioneers to focus their attention on a new class of millennial connoisseurs from the tech world.\par \par \uc2 The arrangement left auction houses prioritizing Pak cubes and Bored Apes -- collectibles that are the closest one can get to brand-names in the crypto world -- in sales that further alienated the skeptics.\par \par \uc2 But one year later, \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  has started using the more genteel language of art history to entice traditional collectors toward \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based collectibles for a sale, Natively Digital NFT. It is running April 18-25 and is designed to unite early pioneers of computer art with their crypto counterparts.\par \par \uc2 Traditional collectors are often drawn to provenance and pedigree, so a sale focused on the lineage of computer art might help convince them that NFT artists have a stronger art historical foundation beyond the beep and boop of internet forums.\par \par \uc2 The event features some of the earliest examples of generative art, a genre where control of the creative process is determined by algorithms or a predetermined process to create images. Examples include artists working in the 1960s and 1970s like Vera Molnar, Chuck Csuri and Roman Verostko alongside more recent offerings from the digital artists Dmitri Cherniak, Tyler Hobbs and Anna Ridler.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  press release says ''the prescient and pioneering work'' by Molnar, Csuri and Verostko ''has provided the foundation for the digital artists at the forefront of the digital art and NFT movement.''\par \par \uc2 ''Generative art is a movement that has sparked interest,'' said Michael Bouhanna, 30, a contemporary art specialist who organized the \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  sale. Having more than a half-century of history behind generative art helps soothe the skeptics, he said, adding, ''Discussions with traditional collectors have been easier.''\par \par \uc2 NFTs of art and collectibles generated more than $23 billion in sales, according to some industry reports, a number that some experts have said could indicate a bubble getting ready to burst.\par \par \uc2 The art adviser Todd Levin said that sellers are producing more historically informed exhibitions to broaden the market's appeal and create a sustainable business model.\par \par \uc2 ''These are the godfathers and godmothers of digital art that you need to know,'' Levin said of the older artists included in the auction. ''You can't just keep selling NFTs without that cultural context.''\par \par \uc2 In February, an anonymous collector who had consigned 104 CryptoPunk NFTs for sale at \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  withdrew them at the 11th hour. The auction house had estimated that the CryptoPunks, popular works that are some of the earliest minted on the Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , could fetch as much as $30 million -- and the sale was viewed by some collectors as a measure of the NFT market. But the early bidding was lackluster and after the consignor had withdrawn his digital collectibles from the sale, he posted a meme on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  mocking the auction house for believing that he actually wanted to sell his NFTs with them.\par \par \uc2 Later, he used the collection as collateral for an $8.3 million loan that was registered on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  by a company called NFTfi. Levin said that the exchange demonstrated that the CryptoPunks collection still had a market, but perhaps not as ravenous as the auction house had hoped.\par \par \uc2 ''He could have his cake and eat it, too,'' Levin said. ''He gets $8 million to play around with and didn't have to sell his CryptoPunks to raise the money.''\par \par \uc2 There are indications that the new historical approach is working. Earlier this month, \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  sold a receipt by the French artist Yves Klein for $1.2 million, nearly double its high estimate. The small piece of paper was part of the artist's 1959 project called ''Zone of Empty Space,'' a project touted as the first tokenization of art, decades before NFTs became popular. The art process typically involved Klein giving buyers receipts in exchange for gold. In some cases -- clearly not all -- buyers burned their receipts while Klein dropped half of their payments into the Seine.\par \par \uc2 Although her name isn't yet as recognizable as Klein, Molnar's star is rising as collectors look for the origin story of digital art from the analogue era of the 1960s. The Hungarian artist, now 98, currently has solo exhibitions at the \uc2 University of California, Irvine\uc2  and the Venice Biennale. And she has embraced the digital movement, creating a new NFT for the auction, with a high estimate of $150,000 -- nearly 10 times as much as the high estimate on the early work, ''1% de d\u233\'00\'E9sordre,'' she is offering at auction.\par \par \uc2 ''I've become so used to not being known, to working in my corner,'' Molnar said in an interview over email about the newfound recognition she is receiving. ''It feels good!''\par \par \uc2 (Molnar created her first computer drawings in 1968 by using an \uc2 IBM\uc2  machine and punch cards.) ''I hate everything that is natural and I love the artificial,'' she added, speaking of NFTs. ''I'm so happy to be doing this because it is the world of today.''\par \par \uc2 ''The Wonder of It All,'' left, by Anne Spalter, which is to be sold at Sotheby's in an auction later this month. Right,''1% de d\u233\'00\'E9sordre,'' a work by the artist Vera Molnar from 1977 that was made with the help of a computer.

\par\par \uc2 National Desk; SECTA\par \b \uc2 Crypto Firms Have a Wish List. States Are Turning It Into Law.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eric Lipton and David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 2,254 \uc2 words\par \uc2 11 April 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In the absence of federal regulations, crypto lobbyists and executives are going state by state to get favorable rules enacted. Many lawmakers have been willing partners.\par \par \uc2 TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- The debate took less than four minutes.\par \par \uc2 In the Florida House last month, legislators swiftly gave final approval to a bill that makes it easier to buy and sell cryptocurrency, eliminating a threat from a law intended to curb money laundering. One of the few pauses in the action came when two House members stood up to thank crypto industry ''stakeholders'' for teaming with state officials to write a draft of the bill.\par \par \uc2 ''Whether you're \uc2 Binance\uc2  or Ethereum, Dogecoin or Bitcoin, this is a great bill,'' said Representative John Snyder, a Palm City Republican, referring to crypto exchanges and coins.\par \par \uc2 Shortly afterward, the House voted unanimously to pass the measure. The Senate followed, sending the bill to Gov. \uc2 Ron DeSantis\uc2  for his signature after 75 seconds of deliberations.\par \par \uc2 Florida's warm embrace of the cryptocurrency agenda is just the tip of an aggressive industry-led push to position states as crypto-friendly beachheads. Across the nation, crypto executives and lobbyists are helping to draft bills to benefit the fast-growing industry, then pushing lawmakers to adopt these made-to-order laws, before moving rapidly to profit from the legislative victories.\par \par \uc2 The effort is part of an emerging national strategy by the crypto industry, in the absence so far of comprehensive federal regulatory demands, to work state by state to engineer a more friendly legal system. Lobbyists are aiming to clear the way for the continued explosive growth of cryptocurrency companies, which are trying to revolutionize banking, e-commerce and even art and music.\par \par \uc2 Many states are racing to satisfy the wish lists from crypto companies and their lobbyists, betting that the industry can generate new jobs. But some consumer advocates worry that this aim-to-please effort could leave investors and businesses more vulnerable to the scams and risky practices that have plagued crypto's early growth.\par \par \uc2 In Florida, the new money-transmission legislation emerged from a monthslong collaboration between Representative Vance Aloupis Jr., a Republican of South Miami, and Samuel Armes, who is starting a cryptocurrency investment firm, Tortuga Venture Fund.\par \par \uc2 ''Vance has been an incredible asset to the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  and crypto community,'' Mr. Armes said.\par \par \uc2 Similar teamwork has been on display in Wyoming, North Carolina, Illinois, Mississippi, Kentucky and other states, according to a \uc2 New York Times\uc2  review of state legislative proposals and interviews with legislators and their industry allies.\par \par \uc2 At least 153 pieces of cryptocurrency-related legislation were pending this year in 40 states and Puerto Rico, according to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures. While it was unclear how many were influenced by the crypto industry, some bills have used industry-proposed language almost word for word. One bill pending in Illinois lifted entire sentences from a draft provided by a lobbyist.\par \par \uc2 In New York, at least a dozen industry players have hired lobbyists over the last year -- including \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 .com, a crypto exchange, and Paxos, which is trying to set up a national crypto bank -- collectively spending more than $140,000 a month, state records show.\par \par \uc2 The state proposals include bills to exempt cryptocurrency from securities laws intended to protect investors from fraud. Other legislation, such as in Florida, would exclude certain cryptocurrency transactions from money-transmission laws enacted to curb money laundering. Some would take even more radical steps, as in Arizona, where one legislator wants to declare Bitcoin legal tender so it can be accepted to pay off debts.\par \par \uc2 ''Legislators want to be on the cutting edge, on the side of something new,'' said Kristin Smith, executive director of the \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Association, a Washington group that represents the industry. ''We want to cultivate more champions.''\par \par \uc2 The moves have alarmed current and former financial regulators like Lee Reiners, a onetime supervisor at the \uc2 Federal Reserve Bank of New York\uc2 , who is now at \uc2 Duke University\uc2  law school. He raised objections last year before North Carolina passed a bill exempting certain experimental cryptocurrency start-ups from the state's consumer protection laws.\par \par \uc2 ''States are being convinced you have to do this if you want to be competitive, so they're rolling out the red carpet for crypto firms,'' he said. ''There's no one pushing back saying there are big risks here to your citizens, of money laundering, consumer fraud and tax evasion.''\par \par \uc2 State legislators, many of whom have limited background in financial regulation, said they had little choice but to rely on industry experts, given the complexity of the crypto marketplace.\par \par \uc2 About two years ago, Jason Saine, a state representative in North Carolina, spoke with Dan Spuller, who wanted to pitch him on crypto projects and later joined the \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Association.\par \par \uc2 ''What would it look like?'' Mr. Saine said he recalled asking. ''You tell me.''\par \par \uc2 Their collaboration resulted in a bill that Mr. Saine introduced last year creating a regulatory ''sandbox'' for financial technology projects -- essentially a special license allowing the industry to test new products without following certain regulatory requirements. The bill passed in October.\par \par \uc2 Solving the 'Espinoza Problem'\par \par \uc2 In Florida, it began with the 2019 book ''Bitcoin Billionaires.''\par \par \uc2 State legislators started working with the crypto industry after Mr. Aloupis read the book, which details the efforts of the Winklevoss brothers, who helped create \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , to generate new wealth in the crypto industry.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Aloupis said he had then spoken with the \uc2 Gemini Trust Company\uc2 , the cryptocurrency exchange that the Winklevosses founded, and Anchorage Digital, the first federally chartered cryptocurrency bank, for input on possible legislation he could introduce.\par \par \uc2 At the time, crypto executives were frustrated with a 2019 Florida court ruling that upheld the conviction of Mitchell Espinoza, who had sold Bitcoin to a Miami Beach police officer working undercover as the operator of a Russian stolen-credit-card enterprise. Mr. Espinoza was charged with laundering money and failing to hold a Florida money-transmission license.\par \par \uc2 The ruling meant that any two-party transaction involving cryptocurrency in Florida -- even perhaps withdrawing money from a crypto A.T.M. or buying crypto on an exchange -- required sellers to have a state money-transmission license. For crypto companies, that necessitated meeting financial stability requirements and completing complicated paperwork. They called it the ''Espinoza Problem.''\par \par \uc2 In July, the state ordered a dozen A.T.M. providers that sell crypto in exchange for cash -- including Cash Cloud, Coin Now and DigiCash -- to register as money transmitters, despite appeals from the companies, documents obtained by The Times show.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Mr. Aloupis introduced the bill to exempt two-party crypto transactions, after lobbying appeals by Mr. Armes and a trade group he leads, the Florida \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Business Association. (Its members include \uc2 Binance\uc2 , the large crypto exchange.) The bill failed to win Senate approval, and it was reintroduced for this year's session.\par \par \uc2 Russell Weigel, the Florida commissioner of the Office of Financial Regulation, said he endorsed the legislation that Mr. Armes had championed.\par \par \uc2 ''If I go and buy groceries at your food store, that's a two-party transaction,'' Mr. Weigel said. ''Do I need a license for that? It seems absurd.''\par \par \uc2 Lobbyists for \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 .com, a cryptocurrency exchange that moved last year from New York to Miami, and Bit5ive, which manufactures crypto mining equipment in the Florida area, joined the effort, contacting dozens of state lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 ''They are very pro crypto,'' Robert Collazo, the Bit5ive chief executive, said of Florida lawmakers.\par \par \uc2 In the future, the company plans to raise money for crypto-friendly legislators in Florida, said Michael Kesti, Bit5ive's lobbyist. The legislative affairs director of the Florida \uc2 blockchain\uc2  association, Jason Holloway, is already running for the State House, with donations -- some in cryptocurrency -- from Mr. Armes and others.\par \par \uc2 ''I don't want it to seem like we are paying for the influence,'' Mr. Kesti said. ''But we do want to support them.''\par \par \uc2 A nationwide lobbying push\par \par \uc2 What's happened in Florida is playing out in other states as the crypto industry mobilizes to move its agenda -- or defend against efforts to rein it in.\par \par \uc2 In New York, for example, concern about the environmental impact of so-called crypto mining -- in which large amounts of electricity are used to run computers that allow investors to get newly issued crypto tokens -- has led to pending legislation to ban these centers. Another bill proposes cracking down on common forms of crypto fraud. The result has been a flood of lobbying in New York to combat these measures.\par \par \uc2 The opposite is happening in Georgia and Illinois, where legislators have proposed tax incentives for mining companies.\par \par \uc2 The Illinois bill emerged after Sangha Systems, a crypto mining company, converted an old steel mill in the state into a mining center and sought a special tax break to help finance the project.\par \par \uc2 Last year, a Sangha lobbyist took an official from the state Chamber of Commerce to visit the project in Hennepin, Ill. Keith Staats, the chamber official, suggested modifying a state law to extend tax incentives to mining companies that set up shop in Illinois. He wrote a draft of the bill, which the chamber shared with Sangha.\par \par \uc2 ''I looked at it, I iterated with them,'' said Spencer Marr, Sangha's president. ''They made sure I was good with it.''\par \par \uc2 In January, Sue Rezin, a Republican state senator, introduced the bill -- at the urging of the chamber, she said in an interview. She said she was not a crypto expert and hadn't ''heard too much'' about mining's environmental impact.\par \par \uc2 The bill's final version, which is awaiting action, is nearly identical to the draft written by Mr. Staats -- including technical language about data centers and mining.\par \par \uc2 Not all legislative proposals have come to fruition. In Mississippi, Josh Harkins, a Republican state senator, proposed several crypto bills this year, including one exempting digital tokens from securities laws. He said he had gotten the idea from a lobbyist, Daniel Harrison, who was hoping to start a local \uc2 blockchain\uc2  trade association.\par \par \uc2 The bills died in committee in February. Mr. Harkins said he planned to revive them this summer.\par \par \uc2 Profiting on state legislation\par \par \uc2 In some states where crypto legislation has passed, the architects of the proposals have moved swiftly to profit on the laws.\par \par \uc2 Last year, Kentucky passed a pair of bills creating tax incentives for crypto mining companies. One was sponsored by Brandon Smith, a Republican who leads the State Senate's Natural Resources and Energy Committee.\par \par \uc2 A few months after the bill passed, Mr. Smith teamed up with \uc2 Bitmain\uc2 , a supplier of hardware for crypto mining, to propose a Kentucky-based repair center for mining equipment, a project he has since abandoned. Mr. Smith, in an interview, said he did not consider his work in the industry a conflict, given that he had not applied for the tax credits his law created.\par \par \uc2 Nowhere has the potential for crypto advocates to profit on new legislation become more apparent than in Wyoming.\par \par \uc2 Since 2018, Wyoming has established more than 20 laws that make it easier for the crypto industry to operate. A key player was Caitlin Long, a Wall Street veteran and a crypto booster, who helped engineer a 2019 law that paved the way for banks handling digital assets to receive Wyoming charters.\par \par \uc2 Not long after the crypto banking legislation passed, Ms. Long opened Avanti Bank and thanked Wyoming's Legislature for making the business possible. The bank promptly received a state charter.\par \par \uc2 Last year, the business, now known as Custodia, raised $37 million from venture investors. ''Somebody has to be in the arena, doing the work,'' Ms. Long said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Long worked on the banking legislation with Trace Mayer, a crypto investor and entrepreneur. Both had invested in Kraken, a crypto exchange that also received a state charter.\par \par \uc2 Critics have accused Ms. Long of using her influence to enrich herself.\par \par \uc2 ''They came in and started writing legislation that really gamed it to their advantage,'' said Robert Jennings, who served with Ms. Long on a coalition of crypto supporters in Wyoming. ''It quit being about 'How do we help Wyoming people?' and quickly became 'How do we game this system for the big crypto players?'''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Long said she hadn't decided to start a crypto bank until months after Wyoming's legislation passed, when it was unclear whether others would take advantage of the law.\par \par \uc2 ''It's not easy to find the right people,'' she said. ''The crypto kids in hoodies, so to speak, were not likely to pass muster.''\par \par \uc2 In Florida, a bill that makes buying and selling cryptocurrency easier passed last month after collaboration with the crypto industry. ''Whether you're Binance or Ethereum, Dogecoin or Bitcoin, this is a great bill,'' said Representative John Snyder, a Republican.; Representative Vance Aloupis Jr. became interested in cryptocurrency legislation after reading ''Bitcoin Billionaires.''

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- Please, Kim Kardashian, don't elope with Pete Davidson.\par \par \uc2 We're already distracted by the wonder of Ketanji Brown Jackson and the blunder of Will Smith, the arrival of dreamy spring days and the return of dreaded mask rules.\par \par \uc2 If we get one more shiny object to contemplate, I fear our support for Ukraine might waver. Do we have the attention span to stay focused on the Russian descent into pure evil?\par \par \uc2 With brutal methods perfected in other conflicts, the Russians are committing ever more brazen atrocities; they are raping and killing civilians. On Friday, they struck fleeing civilians in a train station in eastern Ukraine, where a missile psychopathically labeled ''For our children'' killed at least 50 people and wounded nearly 100.\par \par \uc2 ''Why do they need to hit civilians with missiles? Why this cruelty?'' \uc2 Volodymyr Zelensky\uc2  asked the Finnish Parliament on Friday, adding, ''Sometimes, you think whether they are human at all.''\par \par \uc2 He pleaded, ''Hatred has to lose.''\par \par \uc2 But are we moving on? Moving on, after all, is the favorite American activity. And technology has exacerbated our twitchy consciousness and sensationalist culture. We now live in a world of nothing but distractions, with a blizzard of stimuli.\par \par \uc2 We have a way of turning everything into trends. Once, there were causes. Now, there are trends. ''You're trending'' is the highest compliment you can pay someone -- or the biggest alarm you can sound. If something is trending, no matter what, it commands the highest commercial respect.\par \par \uc2 But trends are transient, by definition. American attention goes from transient to transient to transient. A lifetime of ephemera. We used to have thought leaders; now we have influencers.\par \par \uc2 It's a cognitive challenge, but can we find ways to keep our attention on things that require our attention? Do we have any mental discipline at all?\par \par \uc2 Consider climate change. We can stick with our concern when California and Colorado are burning to a crisp. But then the fires burn out and we move on to the next thing, the next trend. Crises are not trends.\par \par \uc2 Look at energy independence. We dwell on it when the Saudi crown prince sends a team to dismember Jamal Khashoggi or when \uc2 Vladimir Putin\uc2  shows what a monster he is in Ukraine. But then the fickleness of our attention span kicks in. High gas prices? Make peace with the monsters. ''Biden Needs to Make Up With Saudi Arabia, or China Will Gain,'' read the headline on Karen Elliott House's piece in The Wall Street Journal.\par \par \uc2 To add to the distraction, Putin creates his own alternative reality in Russia, as \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  does here, with those susceptible to his lies. The Russians denied striking the train station in eastern Ukraine. They claim the Ukrainians are blowing themselves up.\par \par \uc2 I called \uc2 Jaron Lanier\uc2 , known as the father of virtual reality, to ask him about this.\par \par \uc2 ''It takes a lot of energy to process a big lie compared to a little lie, and so the big lie actually has a better chance of sailing through,'' he said from his home in Berkeley, Calif. ''I think, in the same sense, just the degree of atrocity and evil is hard for us to process.''\par \par \uc2 He shared his philosophy that, through history, when politics, culture and technology get too fancy and theoretical, they tend to lose staying power and brutality breaks through.\par \par \uc2 ''The Bolsheviks had this tremendously sophisticated, fancy rhetoric and all of these complicated ideas,'' Lanier said. ''They were building their own socioeconomics. Then, basically what happened is, Stalin came in and said, 'No, it's really just about violence and domination, and screw all that.'\par \par \uc2 ''I think the current wave of populism has that character,'' Lanier added. ''The ever finer gradations of thought on all kinds of issues, like gender and intersectionality and this theory and that theory, it's so sophisticated that it requires a lot of patience. It's too inbred to be robust. So this very crude thing comes in.\par \par \uc2 ''There's more and more sophisticated talk about how we're going to do \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , nonfungible tokens and cryptocurrencies, with contracts built in in its algorithms. I'm personally of the belief that this very fancy approach to technology is headed in the same direction as cultures or politics that get too fancy and too full of themselves.\par \par \uc2 ''Basically, the Russians came in and said, 'Screw all of your ideas. We're just going to brutally take this stuff over and use it for power.' Putin's psychological operatives looked at all the stuff we do on social media and said, 'We'll just step in and use that to weaken you. We don't care about these ideas.'\par \par \uc2 ''I think ideals are great, but idealists who get too involved with their own sense of getting more sophisticated to perfect their schemes? I think then it reverts to brutality.''\par \par \uc2 As he got off the phone, Lanier offered one note of optimism about Trump, Putin and their ilk: ''One of the great truths of history is that the great deceivers also deceive themselves.''\par \par \uc2 We live in a world of easy deceit and endless distractions. Solidarity with Ukraine is trending now, but will it last? Real solidarity is not a trend. It's a commitment. Can the Ukrainians count on us? Or are we going to let them down as our attention wanders?\par \par \uc2 The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 Teen Drama Star vs. Crypto\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany \par \uc2 1,936 \uc2 words\par \uc2 3 April 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The actor, best known for his starring role in ''The O.C.,'' has become an outspoken critic of a volatile market driven by speculation. Who's listening?\par \par \uc2 ROCKDALE, Texas -- Ben McKenzie was driving his father's silver Subaru through Texas farmland, talking in breathless bursts about money: who has it, who needs it, what makes it real or fake. He detailed the perils of cryptocurrency exchanges, the online brokers that sell Bitcoin and Ether to speculators, then delivered a glowing endorsement of ''Capital in the Twenty-First Century,'' a 700-page book by the economist \uc2 Thomas Piketty\uc2  about income inequality and the power of wealthy capitalists.\par \par \uc2 ''If they can make money on it, they'll do it,'' Mr. McKenzie, 43, said as he sped past cattle farms and run-down gas stations one morning in March.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKenzie was on his way to Whinstone U.S., a crypto mining operation about an hour outside Austin, where rows of energy-guzzling machines generate new Bitcoins. Over the last six months, as A-list celebrities have shilled for digital currencies and NFTs, Mr. McKenzie, a TV actor best known for his starring role in ''The O.C.,'' has become an outspoken skeptic. He's written critically about the #ad for little-known coins that Kim Kardashian posted on \uc2 Instagram\uc2  and earnestly asked Reese Witherspoon to stop proselytizing about the metaverse, all while acknowledging that he's not a financial expert.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm just a former teen idol standing here (alone?) asking people to consider downside risk and the possibility of fraud,'' he tweeted in February.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKenzie rose to prominence in the early 2000s playing Ryan Atwood, a brooding, musclebound teenager from the wrong side of the tracks who moves in with a wealthy family in Newport Beach, Calif. After ''The O.C.'' wrapped, he went on to star in two other TV dramas, ''Southland'' and ''Gotham,'' both of which ran for five seasons.\par \par \uc2 But acting work dried up during the pandemic, and like many people, Mr. McKenzie soon found himself sucked down a crypto rabbit hole. After a couple of friends encouraged him to invest, he took a 24-part online course on cryptocurrencies taught by Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or just ''Gary,'' as Mr. McKenzie fondly calls him; they've never met).\par \par \uc2 The crypto market seemed tailor-made for fraud, Mr. McKenzie said. He was convinced the skyrocketing valuations of popular coins were fueled by reckless speculation, rather than any practical application of the technology. ''It doesn't do what currencies do,'' he said. ''It's not a reliable store of value, unit of account or medium of exchange.''\par \par \uc2 In August, Mr. McKenzie sent a Twitter DM to Jacob Silverman, a tech writer for The New Republic who had recently published an essay titled ''Even \uc2 Donald Trump\uc2  Knows Bitcoin Is a Scam.'' ''I'd love to pick your brain,'' the actor wrote. ''Feel free to disregard this if it's all too weird.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Silverman, an ''O.C.'' viewer, was intrigued. He and Mr. McKenzie both live in Brooklyn, and they met for beer and burgers at Henry Public. Mr. McKenzie proposed a book project; Mr. Silverman agreed on the spot. ''I started also to understand Ben's sense of outrage at what he saw and everyday people potentially getting fleeced,'' Mr. Silverman said. Abrams Press is planning to publish their book, ''Easy Money,'' in 2023.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKenzie said his newfound passion has left friends ''supportive but confused,'' while his wife, the former ''Gotham'' star Morena Baccarin, is ''just tired of me talking about it.'' Mr. McKenzie has a bachelor's degree in economics from the \uc2 University of Virginia\uc2 , and over the years he has occasionally chatted about the intersection of law and finance with his father, Pete Schenkkan, a regulatory lawyer in Austin. Still, Mr. Schenkkan said, he was ''astonished'' to learn of his son's crypto fixation. ''It was a leap sideways from the rest of his life.''\par \par \uc2 The project is also a deviation from how many celebrities have approached crypto. Matt Damon appeared in a now-infamous commercial for Crypto.com, a trading platform. Paris Hilton has been hawking NFTs. In an essay for Slate in October, Mr. Silverman and Mr. McKenzie wrote that celebrity endorsements are exposing ordinary consumers to scams such as ''rug pulls,'' in which an anonymous developer solicits funds from investors and then disappears with the money. ''The Hollywoodization of crypto,'' they wrote, ''is a moral disaster.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKenzie has joined a growing group of skeptics and critics known as ''no-coiners.'' In February, he appeared on ''Crypto Critics' Corner,'' a podcast hosted by Bennett Tomlin and Cas Piancey, who post two episodes a week about the risks of decentralized finance and other crypto ventures.\par \par \uc2 No-coiners are often the targets of online abuse, though the trolling can run both ways. ''I've picked a lot of fights,'' Mr. Tomlin said. ''Often I was the one trying to initiate conflicts by trying to point out to people that 'Before you said this, now you're saying this.'''\par \par \uc2 The no-coiners have some of the same idiosyncratic obsessiveness as the crypto bros; like their antagonists, they gather on Discord and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to exchange tips and memes, and they're fluent in acronym-heavy jargon. Mr. McKenzie acknowledges that he is an unusual addition to their ranks, which consist largely of journalists, software engineers and academics. ''I'm an actor,'' he said. ''I don't know what I'm doing.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKenzie's background also gives him some advantages. Many crypto bros try to silence skeptics with the same mic drop: ''Have fun staying poor.'' ''They don't use that line much with me,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''You want to compare real-money bank accounts?''\par \par \uc2 But in the noisy world of crypto, TV fame doesn't necessarily translate to influence. Before setting out for the mine, Mr. McKenzie led a panel at South by Southwest called ''Trust Me I'm Famous.'' The session took place in a large auditorium, with many rows of empty seats. A group of young fans cheered when Mr. McKenzie introduced himself as Ryan from ''The O.C.,'' then spent the rest of the event glued to their smartphones while he held forth on the dangers of unregulated securities trading. (He found his 6-year-old daughter, Frances, slumped in her seat at the end of the panel. ''I know it was boring,'' he told her. ''Are you mad at me?'')\par \par \uc2 Nor did Mr. McKenzie's celebrity open any doors at Whinstone, where he and Mr. Silverman were hoping to do some book research. When Mr. McKenzie pulled into the parking lot, a concerned-looking security guard asked him to identify himself. ''I'm an actor,'' Mr. McKenzie said. Had the guard seen ''Gotham''? No. What about ''The O.C.''? Also no. ''Ask your daughter about 'The O.C.,''' Mr. McKenzie replied with a grin. A second security guard said he had watched ''The O.C.'' but didn't recognize Mr. McKenzie.\par \par \uc2 After a few more minutes of confusion (one of the guards kept referring to the mine's celebrity visitor as ''Bill McKlensley''), the security team sent Mr. McKenzie, Mr. Silverman and a cameraman who was documenting their trip to meet Chad Harris, a former Christmas tree salesman who now manages the Whinstone plant, which was acquired last year by the publicly traded Bitcoin mining company \uc2 Riot \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Mr. Harris seemed as comfortable in front of the camera as the actor turned critic who'd showed up to spar with him; he said he'd given 1,000 tours of the facility. When photographers arrive at the mine, he said, ''I know which way to turn my shoulder.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Harris said he was confident he could go toe to toe with any skeptic; he bragged that he'd recently schooled some crypto haters from Vice News. ''You can't bash something if you don't know all the facts,'' he said. At one point, he boldly predicted that he could change Mr. McKenzie's mind about crypto with a single sentence. He proceeded to speak for several minutes straight about the economic benefits of Bitcoin mining.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Harris led Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Silverman through a vast warehouse filled with hundreds of whirring machines. The cameraman captured footage of Mr. McKenzie in a hard hat, nodding sagely while Mr. Harris explained the intricacies of the liquid-immersion cooling system that keeps the mining machines from getting too hot. On ''The O.C.,'' Ryan is a well of repressed emotion, rarely betraying a hint of his thoughts. Mr. McKenzie, conversely, is a chatterbox: For two hours, he grilled Mr. Harris on the energy costs of crypto mining and the practical utility of Bitcoin as the camera rolled.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Silverman have floated the idea of adapting their still-unwritten book into some sort of Hollywood production. They're modeling the project on ''The Big Short,'' Michael Lewis's book about the savvy investors who predicted the 2008 housing market crash. The movie adaptation features Margot Robbie drinking champagne in a bathtub as she explains the subprime mortgage crisis.\par \par \uc2 ''Jacob and me in thongs,'' Mr. McKenzie said. ''It would probably turn people away.'' Mr. Silverman laughed. ''I will go to the gym for one month,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 If that doesn't work out, there's always TV. Mr. McKenzie said he pitched Josh Schwartz, the ''O.C.'' creator, on a reboot in which a cryptocurrency billionaire, maybe the son of Luke Ward, whose series arc traces an evolution from villain to beloved himbo, moves to Newport Beach and takes control of the local real estate market.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Schwartz ''laughed politely,'' Mr. McKenzie said. (In an interview, Mr. Schwartz suggested an alternate crypto-themed follow-up involving complex political machinations masterminded by Luke's younger brothers. He added that Seth Cohen, Ryan's geeky best friend played by Adam Brody, would ''definitely be trying to sell some NFTs.'' Mr. Brody, reached by text, said he agreed. ''Or he'd be selling bongs out of a van,'' he said. ''I don't know.'')\par \par \uc2 After the tour, Mr. Harris led Mr. McKenzie and Mr. Silverman to a building that the mining staff call ''the White House'' -- the site of the mine's executive office. Standing by the door, Mr. McKenzie pressed Mr. Harris on his cryptocurrency commitments. Wasn't it just another form of gambling? A high-stakes poker game with no real societal value?\par \par \uc2 Mr. Harris shrugged. He said he was comfortable taking financial risks. ''Think about it in parallel with your own life,'' he said. Mr. McKenzie had taken a break from acting and put his reputation on the line to write a book arguing that the nation's tech elites are promoting a glorified Ponzi scheme. ''Life's a gamble,'' Mr. Harris said.\par \par \uc2 For a split second, Mr. McKenzie looked like Ryan Atwood again, brooding thoughtfully.\par \par \uc2 ''That's true,'' he said. ''That's true.''\par \par \uc2 Ben McKenzie of ''The O.C.'' tours a Texas crypto mine to do research for a book.

If sufficient evidence of wrongdoing is found, a formal investigation can proceed. MELISSA EDDY and STANLEY REED\par \par \uc2 AVIATION\par \par \uc2 Russia Seizes Aircraft in Wake of Sanctions\par \par \uc2 All foreign leased aircraft still in Russia after the termination of Western leasing contracts will remain in Russia, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov, right, said Thursday.\par \par \uc2 Sanctions imposed by Western powers in response to Russia's military campaign in Ukraine forced Western firms to terminate leasing contracts with Russian airlines for over 500 aircraft. Russia has said 78 of these planes were seized while abroad, meaning that well over 400 remain.\par \par \uc2 ''The entire fleet, meaning foreign aircraft, will remain in Russia,'' Mr. Borisov said on Russian television.\par \par \uc2 Moscow has passed a law allowing the aircraft, worth almost $10 billion, to be entered on its own register, in contravention of international rules.\par \par \uc2 Bermuda and Ireland, where most of the planes are registered, have suspended airworthiness certificates, which usually means they should be grounded.\par \par \uc2 Russian airlines have thus been hesitant to use the law, fearing that they might jeopardize ties with foreign partners. But Borisov said all the leased foreign aircraft had been entered into the Russian register. REUTERS\par \par \uc2 CRYPTOCURRENCY\par \par \uc2 Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Top Digital Trader\par \par \uc2 A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing \uc2 Binance\uc2 , the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, of violating U.S. securities laws by selling unregistered tokens and failing to register as an exchange or broker-dealer.\par \par \uc2 The lawsuit had been brought in Manhattan by digital token investors who had bought nine tokens through \uc2 Binance\uc2 's online exchange starting in 2017, and which soon lost much of their value.\par \par \uc2 In a 327-page complaint, the investors claimed that \uc2 Binance\uc2  ''wrongfully engaged in millions of transactions'' and failed to warn them about the ''significant risks'' of buying the tokens, and sought to recoup what they paid.\par \par \uc2 U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter, however, said the investors sued too late, having waited more than one year after their purchases.\par \par \uc2 He also said domestic securities laws did not apply because \uc2 Binance\uc2  was not a domestic exchange, even if it used Amazon computer servers and Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2  computers in the United States.

\par\par \uc2 Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU\par \b \uc2 Trade Crypto. Buy NFTs. And Pay Taxes.\b0\par\par\uc2 By David Yaffe-Bellany and Ron Lieber \par \uc2 1,174 \uc2 words\par \uc2 27 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 10\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The question about whether you made money on cryptocurrency is even higher on your tax form than the line for your wages. There are new tools to help you get it right.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  may run on ancient technology, but that isn't stopping it from taking its cut from your newfangled cryptocurrency winnings.\par \par \uc2 In case you didn't notice last year -- or pretended not to -- the I.R.S. moved the question about whether you sold, exchanged or ''otherwise'' disposed of any financial interest in virtual currency. It's now high up on the 1040 form -- above even where you list your wages.\par \par \uc2 How serious is the government getting about crypto? This month, President Biden signed an executive order that raised the possibility of a central bank digital currency. And the next day -- perhaps driving home the point about the tax implications of all this -- the I.R.S. announced that two owners of a cryptocurrency company were going to prison for a combined eight years for tax evasion.\par \par \uc2 ''Crypto actors,'' a Texas federal prosecutor said, ''are required to pay their fair share of taxes, just like everyone else.''\par \par \uc2 That can be complicated if you jumped in with both feet. Are you befuddled by the ramifications of your first gain or loss? Or maybe confused about how exchanging one crypto asset for another creates a taxable event?\par \par \uc2 Fortunately, service providers are starting to show up to help crypto enthusiasts with the software equivalent of picks and shovels.\par \par \uc2 CoinLedger is one of them. It offers a specialized tool that can help track what you paid for digital assets and figure out any tax liability. We asked its chief executive, David Kemmerer, about the tax illusions (and delusions) that crypto investors have as they navigate this process.\par \par \uc2 This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.\par \par \uc2 In what circumstances would you have to pay taxes on your cryptocurrency?\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency is treated very similarly to stocks or equities from a tax perspective, in that capital gains apply when you dispose of cryptocurrency. If I bought that Bitcoin for 100 bucks and then sold it later for 1,000, that $900 capital gain is income that needs to be reported on my taxes.\par \par \uc2 If you're earning cryptocurrency from a job -- and people actually get paid in crypto nowadays -- that is taxable income, at the fair market value at the time you received it. Let's say I did a job for someone and they paid me one Bitcoin right on Feb. 23. Well, on Feb. 23, I'm incurring $40,000 of income. Or whatever the fair market value of Bitcoin was at the time that I received it for my services.\par \par \uc2 Why did your software need to exist?\par \par \uc2 The problem that's unique to cryptocurrencies that does not exist for equities is this data is fragmented across multiple different platforms. Let's say I'm using E-Trade to buy and sell \uc2 Tesla\uc2  stock. Everything happens on E-Trade. It's not normal for any trading person to send their \uc2 Tesla\uc2  stock somewhere else.\par \par \uc2 That's just not the case for crypto. All of a user's transactions can take place across multiple different wallets and across multiple different third parties.\par \par \uc2 The software exists to kind of be the TurboTax for cryptocurrency investors. We integrate with all of the various platforms of the crypto economy. All that data gets fully normalized, and then it gets routed through our tax engines. Then we can generate with the click of a button necessary capital gains, capital losses and income reports.\par \par \uc2 What do you tell cryptonewbies when they ask you about the I.R.S.'s view of cryptocurrency?\par \par \uc2 They're paying very close attention to the digital asset space. It's not accurate to think that ''I'm using crypto, it's pseudo-anonymous, they're never going to know what type of income I'm making.'' The I.R.S. has the ability to see a lot of what's happening in this space, and they're very quickly increasing their investment into being able to do that.\par \par \uc2 It's been a big year for nonfungible tokens. What happens with those?\par \par \uc2 If you bought an NFT and then you later sold it or somehow disposed of it, traded it away for something, you realized capital gains on the fluctuation of that asset.\par \par \uc2 What sorts of crypto transactions make up the largest volume of entries into your software?\par \par \uc2 The most common is spot market trades -- buys, sells -- right on centralized cryptocurrency platforms like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 What about the fees that crypto traders sometimes incur when they buy or sell digital assets on exchanges or other platforms? Can that reduce your taxable gains?\par \par \uc2 So let's say I'm buying Bitcoin on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 . \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  charges me, let's say, a 3 percent fee. That fee can be added to my basis of the asset that I purchased. If I purchased $100 worth of Bitcoin but I also pay this $3 fee, now my basis in that Bitcoin is actually $103. When I turn around and sell it, that is advantageous for me: I'm not incurring as much gain, because my basis is higher.\par \par \uc2 What are the questions that you hear about most?\par \par \uc2 A lot of people ask, ''Hey, this is only taxable once I cash out to fiat, right?'' And the reality is, ''No.''\par \par \uc2 When you're disposing of assets, whether or not you actually come back to U.S. dollars, you can still incur a tax bill.\par \par \uc2 So even if I use my Bitcoin to buy another cryptocurrency like Ether, I can still be taxed on any gains I've seen from my initial investment?\par \par \uc2 Let's say you buy Ethereum on \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  for $1,000, and you hold that for a few months and it rips -- it's at $2,000 now. You sell it to buy stable coins, or Bitcoin. If it was at $1,000 at the time you bought it, you've realized $1,000 in capital gains\par \par \uc2 What about evading taxes? Are there already tax lawyers specializing in cryptoshelters -- or whatever it would be in the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  world?\par \par \uc2 There are a lot of tax lawyers who have carved a niche out into the digital asset world. And a lot of those folks can definitely help from a tax planning and tax avoidance perspective. No one we work with is helping with tax evasion -- that's illegal. But there's a lot of smart people who can help you reduce your taxes through proper planning.\par \par \uc2 Do you have any sense of the overall tax compliance rate?\par \par \uc2 In our survey, we found that over 50 percent of crypto investors were reporting their digital asset activity on their taxes. And we'll see the number continue to drastically go up in the years to come.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Adam McCauley FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220327ei3r0006a\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Time to Enter the Crypto Zone?\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tara Siegel Bernard \par \uc2 1,824 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 A growing array of investment options make it easier to put digital tokens alongside traditional investments. Here's what to know.\par \par \uc2 Larry David travels through the ages, pooh-poohing many of the world's greatest innovations -- indoor plumbing, the dishwasher and, lastly, cryptocurrency. ''Don't be like Larry,'' the Super Bowl commercial urges. ''Don't miss out on the next big thing.''\par \par \uc2 The presence of a boomer comedian pitchman, though, is just the latest sign that crypto has left behind its bleeding-edge roots. Institutional investors are pouring billions into digital tokens, athletes and mayors are taking part of their salaries in cryptocoins, and you may have already run into a Bitcoin A.T.M. at your grocery store.\par \par \uc2 And then there are Bitcoin's FOMO-inspiring, albeit insanely volatile, price movements: After peaking near $69,000 on Nov. 9, it was recently trading at about $39,300 -- still almost five times its value in March 2020, according to \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 It's challenging for a casual observer to disentangle the hype from any true potential, and yet it's also hard to shake that feeling: Are digital tokens worthy of a spot in my portfolio? Are they even a viable asset class at all?\par \par \uc2 There are conflicting signals: The White House is moving toward developing a policy approach to crypto, but federal regulators overseeing workplace retirement plans all but banned it from those most sacred of accounts.\par \par \uc2 Even so, a growing share of steely buy-and-hold investors are being tempted. In a recent Bitwise/ETF Trends survey of financial advisers -- who tend to be hired by the non-YOLO set -- 16 percent said they had allocated crypto to their clients' portfolios in 2021, up from 9 percent in 2020.\par \par \uc2 That's not surprising: There are more ways in than ever.\par \par \uc2 It has been easy enough to open a basic account to buy cryptocurrency on the big trading platforms like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  or Gemini, and it's even possible through apps like \uc2 PayPal\uc2  or Venmo. But crypto is trickling deeper into traditional investment realms: Several Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds hit the market in 2021, making it possible to just click ''buy'' in any brokerage account. Just last month, Betterment -- an established roboadviser known for managing staid portfolios of cheap but reliable index-related funds -- bought a firm that provides baskets of cryptocurrencies and related assets.\par \par \uc2 And there's a steady beat of developments: \uc2 BlackRock\uc2  and \uc2 Charles Schwab\uc2  recently filed to register funds that track the crypto economy, while other providers continue to lobby regulators to let them unleash more products.\par \par \uc2 But even digital currency evangelists admit that investing in Bitcoin and its brethren remains a largely speculative bet on an unknown future.\par \par \uc2 ''This is a fast-moving market, and it's hard to know where it will go,'' said Matt Hougan, the chief investment officer at Bitwise Asset Management, which has $1.3 billion under management in roughly a dozen crypto-related funds.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrencies and their blockchains -- the open and communally maintained electronic ledgers that record transactions -- have potential that we don't fully understand, Mr. Hougan said. Think of it like trying to guess the internet's future in the early 1990s.\par \par \uc2 ''The internet clearly represented a new way to distribute information and could have major consequences,'' he wrote in a report. ''But moving from that to predicting that people would, for example, regularly use smartphones to rent out a stranger's house rather than staying in a hotel is a whole different matter.''\par \par \uc2 As enticing as it is to think you're getting in on the next \uc2 Google\uc2 , it's worth remembering that the dot-com boom went bust. Even Mr. Hougan believes regular investors should tread carefully when deciding how much of their portfolio to commit.\par \par \uc2 ''Above 5 percent, it becomes the driver of the most painful drops in your portfolio,'' he said. ''It becomes very risky.''\par \par \uc2 The curious do not lack for choice. There are nearly 9,700 coins and tokens collectively valued at $1.9 trillion, according to CoinMarketCap, which tallies coins that meet certain minimum criteria. Bitcoin, which has been around for 13 years and is now legal tender in El Salvador, accounts for roughly 42 percent of that value. Ether, which has been around since 2015 and has more sophisticated abilities that allow it to be used in payroll and other arrangements, is roughly 18 percent.\par \par \uc2 Fidelity\uc2 , which is better known for its giant 401(k) business but now has an arm dedicated to holding crypto for institutional investors, believes Bitcoin should be viewed separately from the rest of the pack, with potential as an alternative currency or store of value, like gold.\par \par \uc2 ''It just makes sense as an entry point for most investors,'' said Chris Kuiper, director of research at \uc2 Fidelity Digital Assets\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There's no consensus, of course: Some experts suggest cryptodiversification. But no matter your preferred strategy, there are a variety of ways in, which are familiar to many investors.\par \par \uc2 One of the latest and potentially most seamless ways comes from \uc2 Betterment\uc2 , which recently bought Makara, a registered investment adviser that offers a series of ready-made, indexed crypto portfolios that provide direct exposure to the assets themselves.\par \par \uc2 There are dedicated baskets for Bitcoin and Ether, and a ''blue chip'' basket that holds the 10 largest digital assets on Makara's platform. A so-called DeFi, or decentralized finance, basket -- one of its more speculative -- goes a step further and invests in companies that aim to recreate financial services without the middlemen, using \uc2 blockchain\uc2  and other technologies. Baskets with different assets charge a fee of 1 percent annually (a Bitcoin- or Ether-only basket does not charge fees), and the firm passes on trading costs of up to 0.35 percent.\par \par \uc2 Sarah Levy\uc2 , chief executive of Betterment, said the company was still working through exactly how it would integrate Makara. But there will be disclaimers: ''Part of what we will do as a fiduciary is explain that there is more risk,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Betterment\uc2  said it wouldn't recommend that customers put any more than 10 percent of their holdings on the platform into crypto, but it will ''give customers agency within that context to make their own decisions,'' Ms. Levy said.\par \par \uc2 Exchange-traded funds, which are baskets of investments that trade like stocks, may appear to be an efficient solution, but analysts and other experts say those available now probably aren't the best way to buy and hold.\par \par \uc2 The reason: Instead of holding the cryptocurrency itself, these E.T.F.s invest in futures contracts -- essentially agreements to buy or sell an asset at a certain price sometime later. That can end up being more expensive because the contracts expire -- and must be sold and repurchased, or ''rolled,'' each month. Those costs can be potentially significant, particularly when the new contracts cost more than the previous month's, causing managers to buy high and sell low. Investors must also pay annual fees between 0.65 and nearly 1 percent.\par \par \uc2 ''Futures-based E.T.F.s are a lousy option for long-term exposure to Bitcoin,'' \uc2 Ben Johnson\uc2 , an analyst at \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 , wrote in a note. ''Roll costs and fund fees will likely lead these funds' long-term returns to lag the performance of Bitcoin -- probably by a wide margin.''\par \par \uc2 None of that stopped money from pouring into the first Bitcoin-linked E.T.F., ProShares Bitcoin Strategy E.T.F. Its trading volume on its first day in October surpassed any other E.T.F. in history, according to \uc2 Morningstar\uc2 , and it collected $1 billion in assets faster than any other E.T.F.\par \par \uc2 Several similarly structured funds have followed: \uc2 Valkyrie Bitcoin Strategy\uc2  E.T.F., VanEck Bitcoin Strategy E.T.F. and Global X \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  & Bitcoin Strategy E.T.F., which, besides Bitcoin futures, invests in another E.T.F. that holds \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -related stocks.\par \par \uc2 Thus far, U.S. regulators have denied applications for E.T.F.s that would hold cryptocurrencies directly. The head of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , \uc2 Gary Gensler\uc2 , recently said the futures market was more heavily regulated, making it a safer bet for investors.\par \par \uc2 Other fund vehicles hold crypto directly, but they're grappling with different structural problems and carry higher fees, which are a drag on returns.\par \par \uc2 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust\uc2 , the largest Bitcoin vehicle, with $27 billion in assets, costs 2 percent and trades on the ''over the counter'' market. But these trusts don't have the flexibility of regular mutual funds and E.T.F.s to balance supply and demand, so their share prices may deviate from Bitcoin's price. Another provider, \uc2 Osprey Bitcoin Trust\uc2 , became available (for a fraction of Grayscale's cost) in February, but it faces the same challenges.\par \par \uc2 Grayscale, Bitwise and other providers have said converting to an E.T.F. structure would solve these problems, but they haven't received the green light from regulators, who worry that the underlying coins may be subject to manipulation and fraud. (E.T.F.s that hold actual coins do exist elsewhere, though -- the Fidelity Advantage Bitcoin E.T.F., for example, is available in Canada.)\par \par \uc2 Investors seeking professional guidance may find that more financial advisers now have firsthand cryptocurrency experience -- some of which may be driven by an effort to educate themselves and field questions with more confidence. About 47 percent of advisers reported owning crypto assets in 2021, according to the Bitwise/ETF Trends survey, which polled 619 advisers. That was nearly double the result the previous year.\par \par \uc2 One adviser, Ritholtz Wealth Management, has gone as far as introducing, with partners, a crypto-related index providing broad exposure for its clients through a separately managed account. It charges 0.50 percent annually, and has a sign-up fee of 0.70 percent.\par \par \uc2 Crypto is ''hard to ignore at this point,'' said Michael Batnick, Ritholtz's director of research.\par \par \uc2 Cristina Guglielmetti, a financial adviser in Brooklyn, called the vast majority of her clients ''prime crypto-curious'': ''mid-40s, familiar with tech/pop culture -- it's all around them.'' She tries to understand why they want crypto, while making sure they're aware of its place in their investment mix.\par \par \uc2 ''Are we putting off other goals so you can do this?'' she said. ''Or have we handled everything else that needs handling, and now you're in a good place to be doing more speculative things?''\par \par \uc2 That makes cryptocurrencies just like any other boom-or-bust investment, Ms. Guglielmetti said.\par \par \uc2 ''We just have to understand what role it's playing for you,'' she said.

\par\par \uc2 CRITIC'S PICK\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 Dad's Stuck in a Tech-Induced Purgatory\b0\par\par\uc2 By Joshua Barone \par \uc2 1,149 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 2\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Michel van der Aa's work, a seamless interweaving of opera, film and motion-capture performance, arrives at the Park Avenue Armory.\par \par \uc2 ''I am certain that you exist,'' a daughter tells her father, only to reconsider: ''I am certain that you do not exist.''\par \par \uc2 Her ambivalence is understandable. The question of what it means to be human -- to exist -- is an old one, and, arguing with her father, this woman is not about to find an answer. Only more questions, which accumulate at a breakneck pace in Michel van der Aa's ''Upload,'' a seamless interweaving of opera, film and high technology that had its American premiere at the Park Avenue Armory on Tuesday.\par \par \uc2 This work would seem to contain more than it possibly could in its 85 minutes: a tutorial-like explanation of how a clinic offers immortality by backing up consciousness to the cloud, one man's journey through that process and his daughter's conflicted response as he returns to her -- no longer alive but, well, not dead. Throughout, the score shifts among electronic and acoustic sounds, just as the production moves between -- and occasionally collides -- live performance, prerecorded scenes and motion-capture technology.\par \par \uc2 But van der Aa, an artist of big swings, operates here as composer, librettist and director with the restraint of a confident master. In a way that hasn't always been the case with his works marrying novelty and tradition, there is no dazzle in ''Upload'' that isn't closely tied to the dramaturgy.\par \par \uc2 This is the third version I've seen, starting with a solely cinematic one that premiered online last summer. European audiences can stream it at medici.tv; Americans will be able to do the same starting April 1.\par \par \uc2 The ''Upload'' film made trims to the score that focused its storytelling and had editing that more clearly separated the piece's use of different media. It's effective, though much less affecting than the proscenium presentation at the Dutch National Opera last fall, which restored the introduction -- poetic fragments of phrases about the body, sung like plainchant in the dark -- and an intimate coup de th\u233\'00\'E9\u226\'00\'E2tre at the climax.\par \par \uc2 Van der Aa's creative team has been a constant, among them the dramaturgs Madelon Kooijman and Niels Nuijten, and Theun Mosk, who designed the smoothly integrated set and lighting; Tom Gelissen and Paul Jeukendrup, the nimble sound; and Darien Brito and Julius Horsthuis, the Hollywood-level special effects.\par \par \uc2 Further tweaks have been made for the Armory's capacious drill hall. Particularly striking now is that climactic move, an audience-spanning screen that was closer than in Amsterdam -- a low ceiling -- and more immersive. (But from Row G, it also made my craning neck hurt.)\par \par \uc2 That moment delivers a wash of patient quiet and humanity after 80 minutes of brisk drama. ''Upload'' has elements of the darkly speculative series ''Black Mirror'' and the comparatively hopeful ''Years and Years,'' but its preoccupations are as timeless as they are the finest genre fiction.\par \par \uc2 Not that ''uploading'' is fully fictional. It is our future and present: an already stated ambition to upload consciousness to a decentralized \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , prefigured by the traces of ourselves we already deposit throughout the internet -- our images and inner thoughts slowly building what the clinic of ''Upload'' (shot at the modernist Zonnestraal sanitarium in the Netherlands) would call a Mind File for our digital afterlife.\par \par \uc2 How that file is created is detailed in filmed sequences starring Ashley Zukerman (''Succession'') as a stereotypical Silicon Valley type, hubristically enthusiastic and uninterested in waiting for government regulation, and Katja Herbers (''Evil''), as an empathetic psychiatrist who also has a streak of overconfidence. The technology is available only to a privileged few, the kind of people who would fly to space recreationally. Or, here, buy eternal life at the cost of death -- to avoid the complications, both ethical and ecological, of multiple uploads.\par \par \uc2 For these scenes, van der Aa writes less of an opera score and more of a soundtrack, uneasy yet excited, with jittery strings, chaotic percussion and electronics that warp into crackling white noise -- all played, with propulsive momentum, by Ensemble Musikfabrik, under Otto Tausk's committed and commanding baton. Van der Aa's music takes on a different style, though, for scenes featuring the work's two singing roles: the unnamed father and daughter.\par \par \uc2 We meet them -- the baritone Roderick Williams, delicate and ever sympathetic, and the soprano Julia Bullock, silvery at the top of her range, equally at ease in pop directness and lush lyricism -- after he has been uploaded, without her knowledge. Their interactions have the naturally rhythmic vocal writing of Janacek or Debussy. Left alone, she tends to be accompanied by more traditional sounds, such as a piano or strings, while the father's musical vocabulary is firmly, irreversibly electronic.\par \par \uc2 Their thread of the plot has a short story's simplicity: She scrutinizes his new self, with constantly changing feelings, then has to decide whether to terminate him, to let him die again. That is because something went wrong in the upload process, which ordinarily buries trauma -- in this father's case, the recent, debilitating, loss of his wife.\par \par \uc2 Briefly paused for the first time as an Upload, the father realizes that his grief is still agonizingly present, and that he's doomed to endure it forever unless he is, well, deleted, which only his daughter can do. The opera leaves them on the night before her fateful decision. When that curtain shoots out over the audience, it shows them in split-screen projection -- as if lying together while on separate planes of existence, singing the poetic fragments of the opening, now more pained.\par \par \uc2 The curtain then lifts, revealing a stage from which the orchestra is gone, but electronic music lingers. A video shows the father's memory anchor, meant to keep an Upload from drifting, unmoored, into digital space. It's a virtual rendering of a childhood scene, chasing lizards around a stone wall in the countryside, that begins to glitch and degrade, leaving only a white expanse.\par \par \uc2 Is the continuing score, in the absence of an orchestra, a triumph of technology? Does the conclusion depict the father's deletion -- or even the inevitable decay of all digital files? There are no answers here. If van der Aa offers anything, it is a guarantee of death, and of the unavoidably human response: to grieve.\par \par \uc2 Upload\par \par \uc2 Through March 30 at the Park Avenue Armory, Manhattan; armoryonpark.org.\par \par \uc2 Upload Through Wednesday at the Park Avenue Armory, Manhattan; armoryonpark.org.\par \par \uc2 Julia Bullock is a daughter trying to cope as her father, played by Roderick Williams, now exists as consciousness uploaded to the cloud, in scenes that include film, live performance and motion-capture technology.

\par\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 Start-Up Aims to Get Resale Dollars to Artists\b0\par\par\uc2 By Robin Pogrebin \par \uc2 1,406 \uc2 words\par \uc2 24 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Fairchain generates digital contracts and certificates of title and authenticity, allowing artists to track their work and share in secondary market proceeds.\par \par \uc2 Even before the artist Robert Rauschenberg famously objected to seeing a 1958 painting he originally sold for $900 flip for $85,000 in 1973, artists have been frustrated by not receiving royalties for their work when it changes hands.\par \par \uc2 Previous efforts to address this over the years have failed. But now, as musicians and other creative producers assert more control over their future sales and \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology has allowed for easier tracking of intellectual property, two Stanford alumni have started a business to help visual artists reap the financial rewards when their work is resold privately or comes up for auction, in some cases at many multiples of the original price.\par \par \uc2 ''There has been exponential growth in the secondary market, but artists have largely been left behind, even though they are essential to it,'' Max Kendrick, one of the founders, said. ''How do we create a more sustainable model for the artist and the galleries that support them?''\par \par \uc2 Charlie Jarvis, 24, a computer scientist, and Kendrick, 36, a former diplomat and a son of the sculptor Mel Kendrick, started the company, called Fairchain, in 2019. Little by little, it is gaining traction with artists and gallerists.\par \par \uc2 ''If widely adopted, as it should be, it could be pretty revolutionary,'' said the artist Hank Willis Thomas, an adviser to the company. ''So many artists who died poor spent their whole career giving away what they produced.\par \par \uc2 ''In the music industry, it's expected,'' Thomas added. ''I have friends on 'Law and Order' who, after 20 years, are still getting royalty checks. Outside of live performance we're the only art form that doesn't have some form of residuals.''\par \par \uc2 Kendrick had the idea for Fairchain when an artist friend was forced to choose between paying the rent on her studio and getting dental work (she chose the studio).\par \par \uc2 Kendrick got a management degree in 2019 from \uc2 Stanford Business School\uc2 , where he connected with Jarvis, who was working on a master's in computer science after earning a bachelor's degree there. She stopped short of getting her master's to start Fairchain. ''I was fascinated by the impact of technology on a creative industry,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Fairchain enables artists or their galleries to generate digital certificates of title and authenticity, which are encrypted and recorded on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . When a work is sold or resold, the certificate transfers to the new buyer only after they sign an agreement committing to remit a percentage of the transaction value to the artist who created the work.\par \par \uc2 The royalty percentage is set by the artist or their gallery when the work is first sold, and artists may choose to commit a portion of their future royalties to the gallery that first sold the work. Fairchain has so far generally seen resale royalties set between zero and 10 percent, Kendrick said. Fairchain gets paid $10 every time the title changes hands.\par \par \uc2 Each of Fairchain's advisers -- about 10 people involved part-time in the company on the basis of their expertise -- holds some form of equity or stock options in the platform, which is registered as a Public Benefit Corporation, Kendrick said.\par \par \uc2 The company has also established a nonprofit arm, the Fairchain Fund for Working Artists, which donates 1 percent to 1.5 percent of every sale to a fund that makes small emergency cash grants to artists in need.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 blockchain\uc2  registration allows buyers to verify the provenance of a work in perpetuity, to establish its authenticity and to document transactions, presumably avoiding ownership disputes. Kendrick described it as a ''digital catalog raisonn\u233\'00\'E9.''\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of times you see works of art and you don't know where they came from,'' said Paula Volent, the chief investment officer of Rockefeller University and a founding board member of Fairchain's nonprofit fund.\par \par \uc2 The artist Eric Fischl said Fairchain's technology was crucial at a time in which legal disputes have prompted artists' estates -- like the Andy Warhol Foundation -- to pull out of the authentication quagmire. ''It has to work,'' he said of the venture. ''The thing that has become most problematic is authentication. No foundations want to authenticate anything.''\par \par \uc2 In turning their attention to the issue of artists' royalties, the Fairchain creators have tapped a longstanding problem for working artists: Most of them only get paid from an initial sale.\par \par \uc2 ''I have long said that residual payments for visual artists are overdue,'' the artist Frank Stella said in a statement that Fairchain provided to \uc2 The New York Times\uc2 . ''Benefits from the appreciation of artworks accrue entirely to others, despite the artist's essential and ongoing work in developing their practice and building the value of their works.''\par \par \uc2 This affects all levels of the art market, from emerging to established names. In 2018, for example, David Hockney's painting, ''Portrait of an Artist (Pool With Two Figures),'' went for $90.3 million at Christie's; the artist originally sold it for $18,000 in 1972.\par \par \uc2 That same year, when the city of Chicago decided to sell a Kerry James Marshall mural at auction -- it was estimated to go for $10 million to $15 million, having been commissioned for $10,000 in 1993 -- the sale was ultimately canceled after the artist publicly criticized the city for wringing ''every bit of value they could from the fruits of my labor.''\par \par \uc2 Through Fairchain, an artist's original gallery can also share in the proceeds from a large secondary sale, even if it no longer represents the artist.\par \par \uc2 ''Smaller galleries are punished for their success by launching artists and then not reaping any of the benefits for having discovered them,'' Kendrick said.\par \par \uc2 Some artists say Fairchain would make them more comfortable about interacting with galleries. ''I have a lot of friends who don't even want to be part of the art market,'' said the Bronx-based artist Alteronce Gumby, an investor in the company. While Fairchain may introduce ''a lot of paperwork and a lot of language we're not used to,'' he added, ''I think it's important for us to understand this ecosystem and the power that we have.''\par \par \uc2 Fairchain, which started operating in December, is likely tobe slow to become standard operating procedure, given entrenched resistance in the art market and the track record of previous attempts. The 1977 California Resale Royalties Act, for example, was overturned by a federal appeals court in 2018 on the grounds that it conflicted with federal copyright law.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a mountain to be climbed here,'' said the dealer James Cohan. ''Artists will have to insist -- 'if you want to buy my art, you have to do it this way.'''\par \par \uc2 Still, Fairchain said it has attracted the support of prominent investors who have also funded start-ups like \uc2 Postmates\uc2  and Superhuman. Fairchain was recently included in the Deciders Issue of ARTnews, highlighting ''individuals and institutions currently contributing to the cultural conversation,'' which was guest-edited by Thomas.\par \par \uc2 And some art world experts believe the moral argument has gained more support, and that the industry will this time feel compelled to get on board.\par \par \uc2 ''It just seems obvious that it's fair,'' said the artist Carroll Dunham. ''People argue it will stifle the resale market and make the whole art business less fluid. But there has to be an inflection point.''\par \par \uc2 Mindful that galleries closely guard the details of their deals, Fairchain keeps collectors' identities and sales terms private from third parties. At the same time, Fairchain believes the art market is ripe for change, given that tech-friendly millennials now account for 52 percent of high-net-worth collectors, according to the 2021 Art Basel and \uc2 UBS\uc2  report, and are the highest art spenders overall.\par \par \uc2 ''It's a paradigm shift in what it means to collect,'' Kendrick said.\par \par \uc2 ''We are cleareyed about the need to respect norms,'' he added. ''We are not bringing transparency to the market. We are bringing clarity to these transactions.''\par \par \uc2 From left, top row: Alteronce Gumby, artist; Ludovic Nkoth, artist; Max Kendrick, a founder.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Along a dirt-covered road deep in Texas farm country, the cryptocurrency company \uc2 Argo \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  is building a power plant for the internet age: a crypto ''mining'' site stocked with computers that generate new Bitcoins.\par \par \uc2 But unlike other Bitcoin mining operations, which consume large quantities of fossil fuels and produce carbon emissions, \uc2 Argo\uc2  claims it's trying to do something environmentally responsible. As \uc2 Peter Wall\uc2 , \uc2 Argo\uc2 's chief executive, led a tour of the 126,000-square-foot construction site one morning this month, he pointed to a row of wind turbines a few miles down the road, their white spokes shining in the sunlight.\par \par \uc2 The new facility, an hour outside Lubbock, would be fueled mostly by wind and solar energy, he declared. ''This is Bitcoin mining nirvana,'' Mr. Wall said. ''You look off into the distance and you've got your renewable power.''\par \par \uc2 Facing criticism from politicians and environmentalists, the cryptocurrency mining industry has embarked on a rebranding effort to challenge the prevailing view that its electricity-guzzling computers are harmful to the climate. All five of the largest publicly traded crypto mining companies say they are building or already operating plants powered by renewable energy, and industry executives have started arguing that demand from crypto miners will create opportunities for wind and solar companies to open facilities of their own.\par \par \uc2 The effort -- partly a public-relations exercise, partly a genuine attempt to make the industry more sustainable -- has intensified since last spring, when China began a crackdown on crypto mining, forcing some mining operations to relocate to the United States. A trade group called the Bitcoin Mining Council also formed last year, partly to tackle climate issues, after \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2  criticized the industry for using fossil fuels.\par \par \uc2 Crypto mining does not involve any picks or shovels. Instead, the term refers to a verification and currency creation process that is essential to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Powerful computers race one another to process transactions, solving complex mathematical problems that require quintillions of numerical guesses a second. As a reward for this authentication service, miners receive new coins, providing a financial incentive to keep the computers running.\par \par \uc2 In Bitcoin's early years, a crypto enthusiast could mine coins by running software on a laptop. But as digital assets have become more popular, the amount of power necessary to generate Bitcoin has soared. A single Bitcoin transaction now requires more than 2,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or enough energy to power the average American household for 73 days, researchers estimate.\par \par \uc2 To achieve that, some miners are reviving broken-down coal plants, or using low-cost natural gas to power their computers. Last month, a study in the journal Joule found that Bitcoin mining worldwide may be responsible for about 65 megatons of carbon dioxide a year, comparable to the emissions of Greece.\par \par \uc2 According to the study, the Bitcoin network's use of green energy sources also dropped to an average of 25 percent in August 2021 from 42 percent in 2020. (The industry has argued that its average renewable use is closer to 60 percent.) That's partly a result of China's crackdown, which cut off a source of cheap hydropower. But it reflects fundamental economic incentives, too, said Alex de Vries, one of the authors of the Joule study. Renewable energy is an intermittent power source -- the sun shines only part of the day, and wind speeds fluctuate considerably.\par \par \uc2 ''What a miner is going to do if they want to maximize the profit is put their machine wherever it can run the entire day,'' Mr. de Vries said.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin's ballooning energy use has long outraged environmentalists. But the criticism that made the strongest impression came from Mr. Musk, a longtime Bitcoin booster, who said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  in May that \uc2 Tesla\uc2 , his electric car company, would no longer accept cryptocurrency payments because of the ''increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions.''\par \par \uc2 His tweet sent the mining industry into crisis mode. \uc2 Michael Saylor\uc2 , the chief executive of the software company \uc2 MicroStrategy\uc2 , which invests heavily in Bitcoin, got in touch with Mr. Musk to discuss the climate issue. A group of mining executives, including Mr. Saylor and Mr. Wall, later met with Mr. Musk over Zoom.\par \par \uc2 ''He wanted to make sure that the industry is on the side of sustainability, and he gave us some coaching,'' Mr. Saylor recalled. ''His encouragement was: 'Find out how clean is the energy, how sustainable is the energy. Figure out how much you're using.''' (Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.)\par \par \uc2 After the call, Mr. Saylor set up the Bitcoin Mining Council, a forum for the industry to share ideas and coordinate environmental strategy. One member, \uc2 TeraWulf\uc2 , has pledged to run cryptocurrency mines using more than 90 percent zero-carbon energy. It has two projects in the works -- a retired coal plant in upstate New York fueled by hydropower, and a nuclear-powered facility in Pennsylvania.\par \par \uc2 ''Everyone I talk to now is talking about carbon neutrality,'' said \uc2 Paul Prager\uc2 , the chief executive of \uc2 TeraWulf\uc2 . ''The language has absolutely changed.''\par \par \uc2 But financial priorities and technological barriers in the crypto mining industry, which includes more than a dozen publicly traded companies like \uc2 Argo\uc2 , are preventing a complete shift to renewable power. In late 2020, \uc2 Marathon\uc2 , one of the largest publicly traded mining companies, started mining Bitcoin at a coal-powered plant in Montana, citing the easy access to cheap energy.\par \par \uc2 In Illinois, the cryptocurrency mining company Sangha Systems has repurposed an old steel mill in the town of Hennepin. Sangha is run by a former lawyer, Spencer Marr, who says he founded the company to promote clean energy. But about half the Hennepin operation's power comes from fossil fuels.\par \par \uc2 ''It was a compromise we had to make,'' Mr. Marr said. ''It was a means to an end that allowed us to establish ourselves as a company.''\par \par \uc2 In recent months, Texas has become a hot spot for crypto mining, attracting more than two dozen companies. The state has an unusual incentive structure that's well suited to the nascent industry: the Texas grid operator offers what amounts to a discount to companies that can quickly unplug when electricity demand spikes statewide, allowing energy to flow to ordinary homeowners. Many crypto mines can turn on or off in seconds, allowing them to take advantage of the incentive with minimal inconvenience.\par \par \uc2 That deal was part of the attraction for \uc2 Argo\uc2 , a London-based company founded in 2017 that runs two other mines in Quebec, using mostly hydropower. Mr. Wall said \uc2 Argo\uc2  was also drawn to the ample green energy in West Texas. The facility outside Lubbock will be connected to the western sector of the Texas energy grid, where about 85 percent of electricity comes from wind and solar infrastructure, including a set of turbines that sit practically next door to the \uc2 Argo\uc2  construction site.\par \par \uc2 But Mr. Wall can't guarantee that \uc2 Argo\uc2 's new center will have no carbon footprint. That would require bypassing the grid and buying energy directly from a renewable power company.\par \par \uc2 ''A lot of those renewable energy producers are still a little bit skeptical of cryptocurrency,'' he said. ''The crypto miners don't have the credit profiles to sign 10- or 15-year deals.''\par \par \uc2 In the future, he said, \uc2 Argo\uc2  plans to build its own solar panels on site in Texas and broker deals with local renewables companies to buy energy directly.\par \par \uc2 The broader cryptocurrency community is divided over whether cleaning up the mining sector is the best path to environmental sustainability. The energy-intensive authentication system that underlies Bitcoin is known as ''proof of work''; some in the industry are pushing to build new cryptocurrencies on a different system called ''proof of stake,'' which uses as little as 0.01 percent of the energy consumed in the mining process.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Wall said he had no objections to experimentation with an alternative system. Still, he said, he believes in the long-term potential of Bitcoin to transform finance, though he wishes that miners were called something that sounded less extractive, like ''validators.''\par \par \uc2 That's a battle he's unlikely to win. But even in the face of backlash, he said, companies will keep mining Bitcoin.\par \par \uc2 ''It's just going to happen. It's a reality,'' he said. ''We need to do it in an environmentally friendly way.''\par \par \uc2 Top, wind turbines next to Argo \uc2 's new facility in Dickens County, Texas.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This is part of ''The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto,'' a mega-F.A.Q. about cryptocurrency and its offshoots. Kevin Roose, a Times technology columnist, is answering some of the most frequently asked questions he gets about NFTs, DAOs, DeFi, web3 and other crypto concepts. You can view the rest of the series here .\par \par \uc2 What is DeFi?\par \par \uc2 DeFi (pronounced dee-fye) is short for decentralized finance. It's an umbrella term for the part of the crypto universe that is geared toward building a new, internet-native financial system, using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries and trust mechanisms.\par \par \uc2 I am falling asleep.\par \par \uc2 Don't! I promise it's interesting.\par \par \uc2 OK, I'll give it a chance. What do you mean by ''using blockchains to replace traditional intermediaries and trust mechanisms?''\par \par \uc2 Let's back up a bit. To send or receive money in the traditional financial system you need intermediaries, like banks or stock exchanges. And in order to feel comfortable doing the transaction, all parties need to trust that those intermediaries will act fairly and honestly.\par \par \uc2 In DeFi, those middlemen are replaced by software. Instead of transacting through banks and stock exchanges, people trade directly with one another, with \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based ''smart contracts'' doing the work of making markets, settling trades and ensuring that the entire process is fair and trustworthy.\par \par \uc2 So \uc2 DeFi\uc2  is crypto's version of a stock exchange?\par \par \uc2 That's part of it. But DeFi also includes things like lending platforms, prediction markets, options and derivatives.\par \par \uc2 Basically, crypto people are building their own version of Wall Street -- one that is largely decentralized and deals exclusively in crypto, with crypto versions of many of the products offered by traditional financial firms, and without much of the red tape and regulations that govern the existing financial system.\par \par \uc2 Wild West Wall Street! OK, now I'm interested. How big is DeFi?\par \par \uc2 DeFi\uc2 's total value locked or T.V.L. -- a standard way of measuring the value of crypto held in DeFi projects -- is currently about $77 billion, according to DeFi Pulse. That would make DeFi something like the 38th largest bank in the United States by deposits, if it were a bank.\par \par \uc2 So not huge, but not small either.\par \par \uc2 Right. And T.V.L. isn't the only way to measure DeFi's growth. You could also look at trading activity on decentralized exchanges, which has grown by triple-digit percentages in the past year.\par \par \uc2 Or you could take a cue from regulators and politicians, who are increasingly looking to \uc2 DeFi\uc2 's growth with concern. Michael Hsu, the acting U.S. comptroller of the currency, said in a speech at a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  conference in September that many DeFi products reminded him of the credit default swaps and other complex derivatives that were popular on Wall Street in the years leading up to the 2008 financial crisis.\par \par \uc2 And Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat, singled out DeFi in a December crypto hearing, calling it ''the most dangerous part of the crypto world.''\par \par \uc2 Why are people so worried about DeFi?\par \par \uc2 In short, because \uc2 DeFi\uc2  is mostly unregulated, with few of the consumer protections and safeguards that exist in the traditional financial system.\par \par \uc2 Can you give me an example of something that would be regulated in the traditional financial system, but isn't regulated in DeFi?\par \par \uc2 The best example is probably stablecoins. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is pegged to the value of a government-backed currency, like the U.S. dollar.\par \par \uc2 Stablecoins are a critical part of DeFi markets, because if you're a crypto investor, you don't want to constantly be changing tokens back and forth to dollars, or keeping all your assets in cryptocurrencies whose values might fluctuate wildly. You want a crypto coin that behaves like a boring, stable dollar, which you can use without needing to interact at all with the TradFi system.\par \par \uc2 TradFi?\par \par \uc2 It's what DeFi people jokingly call traditional finance.\par \par \uc2 Clever. So, back to stablecoins. What's dangerous about them?\par \par \uc2 Well, regulators have argued that despite the name, stablecoins aren't actually that stable.\par \par \uc2 As my colleague, Jeanna Smialek, explained in an article on stablecoins last year, the worry stems from the fact that stablecoin issuers aren't legally required to back their coins one-to-one with safe, cash-like assets. Investors who buy stablecoins might reasonably assume that each USD Coin or Tether (the two most popular stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar) is worth $1, and that they will be able to redeem their stablecoins for actual dollars whenever they want.\par \par \uc2 But there's nothing in the law, at present, that requires stablecoin issuers to have one-to-one backing. And if they don't have enough reserves to cover the stablecoins they're issuing, the whole thing could collapse if enough investors decide to pull their money out all at once.\par \par \uc2 That sounds bad!\par \par \uc2 It would be, especially since stablecoins are the backbone of DeFi trading. And there are questions among investors and regulators about whether some of the leading stablecoin issuers actually have enough assets to pay out their holders, in the event of a large-scale redemption.\par \par \uc2 So stablecoins might not be stable. What else is potentially worrisome about DeFi?\par \par \uc2 The crypto firms that issue loans, credit cards and savings accounts, without many of the protections or safeguards offered by conventional banks, are also drawing concern. Regulators in the United States have begun clamping down on firms that issue these products, saying they could represent a risk to consumers.\par \par \uc2 Regulators are also looking into decentralized exchanges, or DEXs, which allow users to swap crypto tokens with the help of market-making algorithms.\par \par \uc2 And then there are all the hacks and scams ...\par \par \uc2 Oh, great.\par \par \uc2 Yeah. DeFi, like crypto in general, is a big target for fraud. More than $10 billion was lost to hacks and scams in DeFi projects in 2021 alone, according to a report from the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  analytics firm \uc2 Elliptic\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 There typically isn't much recourse for victims of DeFi scams. And unlike deposits in a regular bank, which are insured by the F.D.I.C., crypto tokens usually can't be replaced or recovered once they're gone.\par \par \uc2 So, let me get this straight. One of the fastest-growing areas of crypto is a Wild West version of Wall Street where there are no investor protections, where the things that are called ''stablecoins'' might not be stable, and where your money could be irreversibly stolen at any time?\par \par \uc2 That's an unflatteringly phrased but largely accurate summary!\par \par \uc2 Why would anyone sign up for this?\par \par \uc2 Four reasons.\par \par \uc2 First, many people like \uc2 DeFi\uc2  because it's so new and unregulated. Building an entirely new financial system from scratch is the kind of intellectual challenge that doesn't come around every day, and lots of people are attracted to the sector's wide open, blank slate potential. Plus, if you're a clever trader or an experienced financial engineer, you could do all kinds of things in DeFi that you couldn't do in the traditional financial system, and potentially make a lot of money very quickly.\par \par \uc2 Second, many DeFi fans argue that blockchains are technologically superior to the existing banking system, much of which runs on ancient databases and outdated code. (Most bank transactions, for example, still rely on programs written in COBOL, a programming language that dates back to the 1960s.) Crypto, they say, is the first form of money that is actually devised for the internet, and as it grows, it will need a new, internet-native financial system to support it.\par \par \uc2 Third, if you've bought into the crypto/web3 vision of a decentralized economy, \uc2 DeFi\uc2  is the financial architecture that makes all of the things you're excited about possible. There's no way, in the traditional financial system, for a DAO to create a membership token out of thin air and use it to raise millions of dollars. You can't call up \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2  or \uc2 Goldman Sachs\uc2  and ask them to give you a quote for Smooth Love Potion, priced in Dogecoin. (Well, you could, but they might have you committed.) But with DeFi platforms, you can find people who are willing to trade almost any crypto asset for almost any other crypto asset, with no central entity's approval needed.\par \par \uc2 And fourth, there's a more idealistic cohort of DeFi fans who see all of this heading in a much more utopian direction.\par \par \uc2 Decentralizing finance, these people say, could help fix what's wrong with our current financial system, in part by eroding the power of big Wall Street banks over our economy and markets.\par \par \uc2 How would that work?\par \par \uc2 These optimists contend that because DeFi replaces human intermediaries and trust mechanisms with public blockchains and open-source software, it's cheaper (fewer fees), more efficient (faster transaction times) and more transparent (less opportunity for corruption) than the traditional financial system.\par \par \uc2 They say it democratizes investing, placing tools in people's hands that only professional investors had access to before. And because you can participate in crypto anonymously and without a bank's approval, they say, \uc2 DeFi\uc2  is a way to provide financial services to people who aren't well-served by the conventional banking sector, and avoid many of the discriminatory practices that have kept minorities from accessing financial services in the past.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the optimists say, \uc2 DeFi\uc2  will become safer and more robust over time, as more people use it and some of the early problems are ironed out. And just as they believe that web3 will replace greedy tech platforms with user-owned collectives, they believe that DeFi will replace today's banks and brokerages with a better, fairer system.\par \par \uc2 That sounds great, but I'm still worried. Didn't we learn our lesson in 2008 about the dangers of unregulated finance? Could DeFi bring about the next financial crisis?\par \par \uc2 Right now, it's unlikely that DeFi could produce any disasters on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. It's still a relatively small piece of the crypto world (which is a relatively small piece of the overall economy), and many of the people pouring money into DeFi are the kind of deep-pocketed investors who could absorb even big losses.\par \par \uc2 But the possibility that DeFi could grow big enough to present a systemic risk isn't lost on regulators, who are scrambling to make the Wild West of crypto a little less wild.\par \par \uc2 Go deeper:\par \par \uc2 ''Finance 3.0: DeFi, Dapps, and the Promise of Decentralized Disruption'' \uc2 Kevin Werbach\uc2 , a professor at the \uc2 Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\uc2 , makes the case that DeFi will revolutionize the world of finance by ''eliminating costly and controlling intermediaries from financial transactions.''\par \par \uc2 ''Anyone Seen Tether's Billions?'' \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2 's report on the mysterious dollar reserves of Tether, the stablecoin at the heart of the DeFi economy, helps explain why regulators are worried.\par \par \uc2 ''The Defiant'' This independent media company's daily DeFi newsletter is an industry must-read.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220320ei3k00072\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This is part of ''The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto,'' a mega-F.A.Q. about cryptocurrency and its offshoots. Kevin Roose, a Times technology columnist, is answering some of the most frequently asked questions he gets about NFTs, DAOs, DeFi, web3 and other crypto concepts. You can view the rest of the series here.\par \par \uc2 OK, start me off gently. What is a DAO?\par \par \uc2 DAO stands for decentralized autonomous organization.\par \par \uc2 That's a mouthful.\par \par \uc2 Sure is.\par \par \uc2 What does it mean?\par \par \uc2 A DAO (pronounced dow) is a new kind of organizational structure, built with \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology, that is often described as a sort of crypto co-op. (Or, alternatively, as a ''financial flash mob'' or a ''group chat with a bank account.'')\par \par \uc2 In their purest form, DAOs are groups that form for a common purpose, like investing in start-ups, managing a stablecoin or buying a bunch of NFTs. ConsenSys, a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  organization, defines DAOs as ''governing bodies that oversee the allocation of resources tied to the projects they are associated with and are also tasked with ensuring the long term success of the project they support.''\par \par \uc2 Once it's formed, a DAO is run by its members, often through the use of crypto tokens. These tokens often come with certain rights attached, such as the ability to manage a common treasury or vote on certain decisions.\par \par \uc2 This sounds kind of vague. Can you give me an example?\par \par \uc2 Sure. The best-known DAO is probably ConstitutionDAO, a group of thousands of crypto fans who raised more than $45 million in the span of a week to bid on a rare copy of the U.S. Constitution that was being auctioned by \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2 . But since that group disbanded after losing the auction (and was mired in controversy as it sought to return money to investors), it's probably not the best example.\par \par \uc2 A better example might be PleasrDAO, a group of dozens of crypto artists, entrepreneurs and investors that was formed to bid on works by high-profile digital artists. The group spent $5.4 million on an NFT affiliated with the whistleblower and activist Edward Snowden, and also bought the Wu-Tang Clan album ''Once Upon a Time in Shaolin'' for $4 million.\par \par \uc2 Once they were purchased, these works became the property of the DAO's members, who can manage them as they see fit. They can vote to exhibit them somewhere, or break them into 1,000 NFTs and sell the pieces to the public, or simply keep them locked away in a physical or virtual vault. In a classic DAO model, all of these decisions would be made ''on-chain,'' through a system of token-based voting.\par \par \uc2 I get why people might want to pool their money to buy stuff. But why is a completely new, crypto-based governance structure necessary for that? Couldn't they just use a normal crowdfunding site?\par \par \uc2 They could. And, in some cases, a DAO might be better off using a platform like Kickstarter, because using crypto to raise large amounts of money can result in users paying exorbitant transaction fees. When ConstitutionDAO raised $47 million, for example, its users paid roughly $1.2 million in fees to the Ethereum network.\par \par \uc2 Ouch. Are there any other drawbacks to DAOs?\par \par \uc2 Some DAOs have found that decentralized, \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based governance is messier than it looks. The first-ever DAO, which was simply called The DAO, raised more than $150 million to build a kind of crowdfunded investment firm, then went up in flames amid a host of legal, governance and security problems. Similar issues have plagued other DAOs since then.\par \par \uc2 DAOs may also run into legal trouble if regulators decide that the tokens they issue are securities, thus requiring them to go through the same registration process as a company selling stocks or bonds. In 2017, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  found that DAO Tokens, the native token of The DAO, were in fact securities, and should have been subject to securities law.\par \par \uc2 The recent DAO boom has also raised eyebrows among regulators and law enforcement agencies, who are concerned that some DAOs may simply be fronts for fraud.\par \par \uc2 ''In some cases, crypto investors and regulators say, the ventures amount to Ponzi schemes intended to do little more than bolster the value of the digital tokens they sell,'' my colleagues Eric Lipton and Ephrat Livni wrote in a recent piece on some of the problems facing DAOs.\par \par \uc2 Even some crypto fans have argued that DAOs haven't yet proved that they can do more than allocating cryptocurrency to crypto-related projects.\par \par \uc2 Grace Rebecca Rachmany, a DAO leadership consultant (yes, those exist), wrote in a 2020 article for the crypto news site CoinDesk that ''DAO technologists have failed to create compelling technology for the problems that society is facing.''\par \par \uc2 Why would people choose to join a DAO, then?\par \par \uc2 Well, it's all a bit new and unexplored. DAOs are still -- to borrow a favorite phrase of crypto fans -- in the dial-up phase, and proponents argue that better, more powerful examples will arrive in the next few years.\par \par \uc2 But if you ask believers, they'll tell you that DAOs are capable of doing a few things better than traditionally run organizations:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 In theory, DAOs can be more transparent than traditional organizations, because the group's important decisions get made ''on-chain,'' using governance tokens and votes that appear on the permanent \uc2 blockchain\uc2  ledger.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 In theory, DAOs can be more democratic than traditional organizations because every participant can vote on group decisions, not just boards or executives.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 In theory, DAOs can be more nimble and fast-moving than traditional companies, because they're often project-specific and you can set them up and wind them down quickly, with significantly less red tape than forming a traditional start-up.\par \par \uc2 Why are you saying ''in theory'' so much?\par \par \uc2 Because there aren't a lot of DAO success stories yet, and most of the benefits are still unproven. Some people are skeptical that DAOs can make more complex business decisions, while others think they amount to little more than thinly-veiled pyramid schemes.\par \par \uc2 Some DAOs, in fact, have allegedly been outright rug pulls -- like AnubisDAO, a dog themed DeFi project whose creator is accused of stealing $60 million from investors.\par \par \uc2 In addition, leaderless corporate structures haven't really worked outside of crypto, and most of today's successful DAOs are what are known as ''protocol DAOs'' -- meaning they're designed to manage infrastructure-type projects for crypto itself. We don't really know how the DAO model would work if applied to a regular, noncrypto business.\par \par \uc2 I'm not a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  engineer or a crypto investor. I'm just a normal person with a normal job, living a normal life. Why should I care about DAOs?\par \par \uc2 Right now, most people don't encounter DAOs on a daily basis. But I'd argue that it's important, in general, to know what kinds of problems technologists are trying to solve. And a lot of well-funded technologists are looking for ways to turn all kinds of organizations -- including ones you might belong to or care deeply about -- into DAOs.\par \par \uc2 Some people have even predicted that DAOs could become a force in politics, enabling a kind of loose, unregulated crypto PAC that could swarm campaigns and lobbying efforts with money and organizing support.\par \par \uc2 In its most basic form, a DAO is a new way for a group of people to aim a large amount of money and organizing energy at a project -- whether it's buying the Constitution, building a new social network, or influencing an election. That's a big, transformative idea, and it would be wise to pay attention while it's taking shape.\par \par \uc2 What are the most interesting uses of DAOs right now?\par \par \uc2 Crypto buffs are starting to experiment with ''social DAOs,'' which are a kind of community-owned social club that you have to pay (in the form of buying tokens) to join.\par \par \uc2 The best known social DAO is Friends With Benefits, which has thousands of members and recently raised $10 million from investors including the venture capital firm \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Friends With Benefits has been compared to a ''decentralized Soho House,'' and it works a bit like an online country club. Members have to buy a certain number of so-called $FWB tokens to get in. (Currently, a full membership costs 75 $FWB tokens, or about $4,000.) Once they're in, they get invited to a Discord chat room where members chat about crypto, trade job leads and investing tips, and hold town halls to talk about the group's future plans. The group hosts members-only parties at major crypto conferences, and members organize local meet-ups in their home cities.\par \par \uc2 Wait, I thought crypto was all about decentralizing power and leveling the playing field. An exclusive club that you have to pay $4,000 to join sounds like the opposite of that. What gives?\par \par \uc2 It's a good question. And I posed it to Alex Zhang, one of the leaders of Friends With Benefits. He responded:\par \par \uc2 -tag="modify_poetry">In most cases, and with FWB in particular, the token price was initially quite low, and it grew as the value of being a member -- real or perceived -- increased over time.It's important, then, to remember that tokens are an asset, instead of the typical recurring fees you'd pay to belong to other kinds of social organizations. At any point in time, if necessary or desirable, someone can sell their tokens.Nevertheless, it will be important for DAOs to continue to create onboarding opportunities for people who can't afford to acquire tokens. For instance, we pay FWB tokens to writers, curators, designers, event volunteers, and other roles that benefit our mission and allow these contributors to earn their way into having an ownership stake in the community.\par \par \uc2 OK, so it sounds like DAOs can get messy and complicated, and some are outright scams, and even the ones that are doing something interesting might be expensive to join. So ... what's the good part? If DAOs are so useless, why are investors funding them, and why are people joining them?\par \par \uc2 As with any crypto project, DAOs have attracted people for all kinds of reasons: speculative gambling, trend-chasing and utopian true belief among them.\par \par \uc2 Among the more serious-minded DAO advocates, a common theme is collective ownership. Like believers in web3, DAO proponents believe that we need a radically different ownership model for the next phase of the internet. DAOs, they argue, could allow us to build a new set of organizations and platforms that are owned by their users, governed in fair and transparent ways, and native to the internet.\par \par \uc2 You could have, for example, a DAO-governed social network, where users could vote to take down certain types of inflammatory posts, or award tokens to people who posted lots of valuable or enlightening content. Or a DAO-ified version of \uc2 Amazon Web Services\uc2  that was run like a co-op, with members pitching in to build new features and keep the network humming.\par \par \uc2 Chris Dixon\uc2 , a venture capitalist and crypto investor, recently argued that DAOs ''can help course correct the internet back to its original, idealistic vision: power and money pushed to the edges, networks growing and flourishing together, a level playing field for talent anywhere in the world, a thriving creative middle class, and a generally diverse and interesting place.''\par \par \uc2 But, of course, it could also become an expensive, unruly mess, as DAOs confront the challenges involved in corralling any group of people toward a common goal, regardless of whether crypto is involved or not.\par \par \uc2 Go deeper:\par \par \uc2 ''The Dao of DAOs'' In this 2021 essay, Packy McCormick, a crypto investor, offers a lengthy analysis of DAOs and their potential future applications, from a pro-DAO perspective.\par \par \uc2 ''Crypto Cities'' A 2021 blog post in which \uc2 Vitalik Buterin\uc2 , the co-creator of Ethereum, sketches a vision of how DAOs could be used to govern entire cities.\par \par \uc2 ''The Biggest Crowdfunding Project Ever -- the DAO -- Is Kind of a Mess'' This 2016 Wired article about the collapse of The DAO, the original decentralized autonomous organization, is a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of decentralized governance.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220320ei3k00071\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This is part of ''The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto,'' a mega-F.A.Q. about cryptocurrency and its offshoots. Kevin Roose, a Times technology columnist, is answering some of the most frequently asked questions he gets about NFTs, DAOs, DeFi, web3 and other crypto concepts. You can view the rest of the series here .\par \par \uc2 I'm hearing this term -- ''web3'' -- all over the place. What is it?\par \par \uc2 Web3 is the name some technologists have given to the idea of a new kind of internet service that is built using decentralized blockchains -- the shared ledger systems used by cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\par \par \uc2 The term has been around for years, but it has come into vogue in the past year or so. Packy McCormick, an investor who helped popularize web3, has defined it as ''the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.''\par \par \uc2 Proponents envision web3 taking many forms, including decentralized social networks, ''play-to-earn'' video games that reward players with crypto tokens, and NFT platforms that allow people to buy and sell fragments of digital culture. The more idealistic ones say that web3 will transform the internet as we know it, upending traditional gatekeepers and ushering in a new, middleman-free digital economy.\par \par \uc2 But some critics believe that web3 is little more than a rebranding effort for crypto, with the aim of shedding some of the industry's cultural and political baggage and convincing people that blockchains are the natural next phase of computing. Others believe it's a dystopian vision of a pay-to-play internet, in which every activity and social interaction becomes a financial instrument to be bought and sold.\par \par \uc2 Why are so many people talking about web3 all of a sudden?\par \par \uc2 Part of it is the usual cocktail of hype, marketing and fear of missing the next big thing.\par \par \uc2 But the web3 boom also reflects the amount of capital, talent and energy pouring into crypto start-ups on the heels of a yearslong crypto bull market. Venture capital firms have put more than $27 billion into crypto-related projects in 2021 alone -- more than the 10 previous years combined -- and much of that capital has gone to web3 projects. Some big tech companies, such as \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and Reddit, have also started experimenting with their own web3 projects.\par \par \uc2 And the industry has become a magnet for tech talent, with many employees of big tech firms quitting cushy, stable jobs to go seek their fortunes in web3.\par \par \uc2 I want to understand web3. But first, can you remind me what web1 and web2 were?\par \par \uc2 Sure. Web1, in the traditional telling, refers to the internet of the 1990s and early 2000s. It was the internet of blogs, message boards, and early portals like \uc2 AOL\uc2  and CompuServe. Most of what people did on web1 was passively read static web pages, and much of it was built using ''open protocols'' like HTTP, SMTP and FTP. (Don't worry about what those things are -- just know that an open protocol is a piece of web infrastructure that isn't owned by a single company, and that the concept of open protocols is going to reappear a few sentences from now.)\par \par \uc2 Web2, the story goes, was the next phase of the internet, starting around 2005 or so -- the one characterized by social media behemoths like \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , \uc2 Twitter\uc2  and \uc2 YouTube\uc2 . In web2 (or Web 2.0, as it was usually called then), people began creating and posting their own content, actively participating in the internet rather than passively reading it. But most of that activity ended up being distributed and monetized by big companies, which kept most, if not all, of the money and control for themselves.\par \par \uc2 Web3, the story goes, will replace these centralized, corporate platforms with open protocols and decentralized, community-run networks, combining the open infrastructure of web1 with the public participation of web2.\par \par \uc2 The crypto investor Li Jin and the writer Katie Parrott sketched the web3 vision this way: ''If the pre-internet/web1 era favored publishers, and the web2 era favored the platforms, the next generation of innovations -- collectively known as web3 -- is all about tilting the scales of power and ownership back toward creators and users.''\par \par \uc2 That sounds ... exciting but vague. How do web3 proponents actually envision that happening?\par \par \uc2 Web3 proponents argue that a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based internet would improve on the current internet in several ways.\par \par \uc2 First, they say, web3 platforms could give creators and users a way to monetize their activity and contributions in a way that today's mega-platforms really don't.\par \par \uc2 Today, for example, \uc2 Facebook\uc2  makes money by aggregating user data and selling targeted ads. A web3 version of \uc2 Facebook\uc2  could allow users to monetize their own data, or even earn crypto ''tips'' from other users for posting interesting content. A web3 \uc2 Spotify\uc2  could allow fans to buy ''stakes'' in up-and-coming artists, effectively becoming their patrons in exchange for a percentage of their streaming royalties. A web3 \uc2 Uber\uc2  could be owned by the drivers on the network.\par \par \uc2 Matt Levine, a \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  columnist, put it this way: ''A basic premise of Web3 is that every product is simultaneously an investment opportunity.''\par \par \uc2 Second, proponents argue, web3 platforms could be democratically governed in a way that web2 platforms aren't.\par \par \uc2 Internet behemoths like \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  are essentially autocracies. They can unilaterally seize usernames, ban accounts or change their rules on a whim. A \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based social network could delegate those decisions to users, who could vote on how to handle them.\par \par \uc2 Third, they say, web3 would be less reliant on advertising-based business models than web2, and people would have more privacy as a result, with fewer trackers and targeted ads following them around and fewer giant companies vacuuming up their personal data.\par \par \uc2 Of course, this is a highly idealistic version of web3, sketched mostly by people who have a financial stake in making it happen. The reality could be much different.\par \par \uc2 What's an example of a web3 app that exists today?\par \par \uc2 An oft-cited example is Axie Infinity, a video game developed by the Vietnamese game studio Sky Mavis, which uses NFTs and Ethereum-based cryptocurrencies to reward players with real money for achieving in-game objectives.\par \par \uc2 In the game, players can ''breed'' characters called Axies, and use them in battles against other players. They can also collect virtual land, in the form of NFTs, and earn a type of digital money called Smooth Love Potion, or SLP, which can be traded on a cryptocurrency exchange. (In an article last year, the writer Casey Newton called it ''Pok\u233\'00\'E9mon on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .'')\par \par \uc2 Axie Infinity has attracted millions of players, including a number of people in the Philippines who make a full-time living from playing the game. But the game's reliance on crypto tokens makes it volatile, and players can lose money if token values drop, as happened last year.\par \par \uc2 That just sounds like gambling.\par \par \uc2 It is, sort of. But gambling is an incredibly successful industry! And web3 people would argue that if you're going to spend hours and hours of your day playing a video game, you should at least have the opportunity to get paid for it.\par \par \uc2 Are there any other apps that could help me understand the web3 hype?\par \par \uc2 It's not as sexy as a video game, but I've always thought that Helium was a good example of a web3 project that demonstrated what makes it different from the technology that came before.\par \par \uc2 Helium is basically a crypto-powered, crowdsourced wireless network. People can sign up to share bandwidth from their home or office Wi-Fi networks with the Helium network, using a special kind of device that plugs into their computer or router. In exchange, they're rewarded with Helium tokens when nearby devices use their bandwidth. The more often their hot spots are used, the more tokens they get. The Helium network has more than 500,000 active hot spots today, many of them powering connected devices like parking meters and electric scooters.\par \par \uc2 You could build a similar network without crypto by going door-to-door, trying to convince people to share slivers of their internet bandwidth with nearby devices. Or, if you were a big telecom company like \uc2 Verizon\uc2  or \uc2 AT&T\uc2 , you could spend billions of dollars to build such a network yourself. But Helium was able to build a network without huge upfront costs by allowing people to earn crypto tokens for adding new coverage to the network, effectively using crypto's popularity to finance the construction of something it wanted to build anyway.\par \par \uc2 So part of the appeal of web3 is that it incentivizes people to do things they might not otherwise do, like playing a video game or sharing their Wi-Fi with strangers?\par \par \uc2 That's part of it. But web3 advocates think examples like these are just the beginning.\par \par \uc2 Go on ...\par \par \uc2 Well, now we're venturing deep into the land of the theoretical, but some believers think that web3 could become the backbone of a new, tokenized society.\par \par \uc2 ''Web3 will house our financial institutions, social interactions, personal identities and much, much more in the not-so-distant future,'' Lior Messika, a crypto investor, told TechCrunch recently.\par \par \uc2 Among web3 fans, there's been a lot of talk about ''decentralized identity'' -- the notion that, in the future, we could all have a kind of reputation score that consists of a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based tally of the jobs we've done, events we've attended and projects we've contributed to. These records would essentially become permanent records of our online lives, and other people could look them up to decide whether to hire us, trust us with some task or even date us.\par \par \uc2 That sounds terrifying. Wasn't there a ''Black Mirror'' episode about this?\par \par \uc2 Yes, there was. And the permanence of web3, along with its dependence on volatile crypto markets, is part of the reason that the grander web3 vision has been met with so much resistance.\par \par \uc2 The writer and technologist Robin Sloan, for example, wrote that the ability to delete things -- ''an operation basically antithetical to Web3,'' in his words -- was actually a desirable quality of internet services.\par \par \uc2 Stephen Diehl, a computer programmer and outspoken crypto detractor, went even further, calling web3 ''the hyperfinancialization of all human existence.''\par \par \uc2 Strong words! What are some other objections to web3?\par \par \uc2 Some skeptics simply believe that web3 doesn't make sense from a technical perspective. They point out that blockchains are significantly slower and less capable than standard databases, and that today's most popular blockchains couldn't even begin to handle the amount of data that \uc2 Uber\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or \uc2 YouTube\uc2  use on a daily basis. To make web3 services perform as well as consumers demand, they argue, you have to build centralized services on top of them -- which would defeat the whole purpose.\par \par \uc2 There are also people who believe that web3 is an attempt by wealthy investors to pay lip service to decentralization while building new, centralized services that they control -- making themselves the new middlemen, in effect.\par \par \uc2 Is that what \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2  was fighting about on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ?\par \par \uc2 Yes. Mr. Dorsey -- the former chief executive of \uc2 Twitter\uc2  -- is a big fan of Bitcoin, which he believes will replace the dollar and usher in world peace. And, like many Bitcoin fans, he is more skeptical of other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  that most of the web3 ecosystem runs on.\par \par \uc2 In a series of tweets in December, he criticized web3, saying that it was ''ultimately a centralized entity with a different label.'' He also took shots at \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , a well-known venture capital firm that invests heavily in web3 projects, implying that their vision of web3 would take control out of the hands of users and put it in the hands of wealthy investors and centralized tech platforms.\par \par \uc2 What do regulators have to say about web3?\par \par \uc2 So far, not much, although the topic did come up during a recent congressional hearing.\par \par \uc2 But the industry could run into hurdles once regulators start paying attention in earnest. One potentially big problem is that crypto tokens -- which are critical to many web3 applications -- currently exist in a regulatory gray zone in the United States. Some regulators, including Gary Gensler, the chief of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , have argued that many tokens are unregistered securities, and that platforms offering tokens should be subject to the same rules as companies that issue stocks and bonds.\par \par \uc2 Crypto companies counter that tokens should be treated as a new kind of asset, not covered by existing securities laws. But it's not clear whether they'll win this argument. And if U.S. web3 start-ups are required to treat their tokens as securities, many of them may have to shut down, change their products or move to a different country.\par \par \uc2 How is web3 related to the metaverse, the other confusing tech word I can't escape these days?\par \par \uc2 The metaverse, if you've been following along, is the term we're using these days for immersive digital worlds in which users can socialize, play games, attend meetings and do other activities together. It's the vision \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  outlined when he announced that \uc2 Facebook\uc2  was changing its name to \uc2 Meta\uc2 . And some crypto proponents believe that web3 is an essential part of the metaverse, because it would allow for the creation of metaverses that aren't controlled by a single company or governed by a single set of rules.\par \par \uc2 Many objects in the metaverse may also be crypto tokens, if the web3 crowd has its way. Your metaverse avatar might be an NFT. Your metaverse house might come with governance tokens or qualify you to join a neighborhood DAO. The mortgage on that house might even be packaged into a mortgage-backed security token and sold on a decentralized exchange.\par \par \uc2 OK, now my head is spinning.\par \par \uc2 That's fine. Honestly, most of this stuff is purely theoretical, and you've got plenty of time to study up if it comes to fruition.\par \par \uc2 For now, just know that web3 is a word you'll be hearing a lot in the next few years as people try to get their heads around the world of new experiences, platforms and moneymaking opportunities crypto enthusiasts are trying to create.\par \par \uc2 Go deeper:\par \par \uc2 ''Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble'' This \uc2 New York Times Magazine\uc2  article from 2018 examines the case for web3 (before it was called ''web3'') as ''a way of getting back to the internet's roots.''\par \par \uc2 ''My First Impressions of Web3'' Moxie Marlinspike, the creator of Signal and a well known cryptography expert, takes a skeptical look at web3 and its technical underpinnings in this 2022 blog post, concluding that ''decentralization itself is not actually of immediate practical or pressing importance to the majority of people.''\par \par \uc2 ''The Web3 Renaissance: A Golden Age for Content'' In this 2021 blog post, Li Jin and Katie Parrott make the case for web3 as a boon to artists, musicians and creators of internet media, saying that technologies like NFTs and DAOs could unlock a ''true creative Golden Age.''\par \par \uc2 ''Notes on Web3'' In this essay, the author Robin Sloan declares himself a ''a full-fledged enemy of Web3'' because of its hyperfinancialization and technical limits.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220320ei3k00070\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 This is part of ''The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto,'' a mega-F.A.Q. about cryptocurrency and its offshoots. Kevin Roose, a Times technology columnist, is answering some of the most frequently asked questions he gets about NFTs, DAOs, DeFi, web3 and other crypto concepts. You can view the rest of the series here .\par \par \uc2 OK, I know NFT stands for nonfungible token. But what does it actually mean?\par \par \uc2 Let's start with the words themselves. In economics, ''fungible'' is a term used for things that can be exchanged for other things of exactly the same kind. The U.S. dollar is fungible, because you and a friend can trade $1 bills, and each of you will still have the exact same spending power. Most cryptocurrencies are fungible, too -- a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin, and it doesn't really matter which Bitcoin you have.\par \par \uc2 But most objects in the physical world, such as cars and houses, are nonfungible -- meaning they have unique qualities, and you can't just exchange them for others of the same type. (You might be willing to swap your 2020 Honda Civic for another 2020 Honda Civic, but the cars wouldn't be exactly the same, and you'd want to know what condition the other car was in before you'd agree to the trade.)\par \par \uc2 Tokens, in crypto speak, are units of value stored on a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 . Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether and Dogecoin are tokens, but not all tokens are meant to be used as money. Tokens can be attached to tangible goods -- \uc2 Nike\uc2 , for example, is experimenting with crypto tokens that are linked to the ownership of physical shoes -- but they can also represent intangible goods, like access to a private chat room or storage space on a cloud server.\par \par \uc2 OK, so nonfungible tokens are sort of like cryptocurrencies, except they have unique qualities and they aren't necessarily used as money. Why is that important?\par \par \uc2 Well, until pretty recently, nonfungible goods didn't really exist on the internet.\par \par \uc2 The internet essentially works like a giant copy machine -- any digital file can be duplicated an infinite number of times, and every copy is exactly the same as the original.\par \par \uc2 The infinite copy-making quality of the internet was great for making digital objects abundant. But it was horrible for making them scarce. If you were an artist who wanted to make only 100 ''first editions'' of your digital artwork, or a professional athlete who wanted to sell digital trading cards to your fans (and have those cards retain value the same way that physical trading cards would), your options weren't great.\par \par \uc2 Several years ago, people realized that blockchains (the shared, decentralized databases that power Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies) could be used to create unique, uncopyable digital files. And because these files were simply entries on a public database, anyone could verify who owned them, or track them as they changed hands.\par \par \uc2 That realization prompted the creation of the first NFTs.\par \par \uc2 But aren't most NFTs just JPEG files that you can copy by right-clicking them and saving them to your computer? How does that solve the file-copying problem?\par \par \uc2 Correct: NFTs don't make it impossible to copy JPEGs. But they make it possible to create an uncopyable digital asset linked to a JPEG, which can be used to mark that particular copy of the JPEG as the ''real'' one.\par \par \uc2 If it helps, you can think of NFTs as like the certificate of authenticity you might get if you bought an expensive sculpture. The sculpture could be copied or forged -- or someone could break into your house and steal it -- but because you have the certificate of authenticity, you can prove that you are the owner of the original.\par \par \uc2 OK, I'm starting to get it. So NFTs are basically a way to claim ownership of a digital file?\par \par \uc2 Yes. Which might not sound like a big deal. (And maybe it will turn out not to be!) But people who are into NFTs think that this idea of being able to claim ownership of digital files is a radically important concept.\par \par \uc2 They argue that scarcity is what gives a lot of objects in the offline world their value. And bringing this quality to the internet through NFTs, they believe, will unlock a whole new market for scarce digital goods.\par \par \uc2 I can see why NFTs are an interesting technology. But why would someone pay millions of dollars for one? You can at least drive a fancy car or appreciate a Picasso painting hanging on the wall -- you can't drive a JPEG.\par \par \uc2 It's true that most NFTs aren't valuable because they're useful. And at the high end of the market -- like the Bored Ape Yacht Club, or the NFT collections being auctioned off by \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  for millions of dollars -- a lot of the value boils down to speculation and bragging rights.\par \par \uc2 But a defense of NFTs I've heard from people in the industry -- or, at least, an explanation for their popularity -- is that NFTs aren't unique in their uselessness. People spend money on objects of no practical value all the time -- maybe to feel good, maybe to show off to their friends, maybe to signal membership in a group. Some objects we buy are tangible (designer clothes, expensive jewelry) and some are digital objects (Fortnite skins, short \uc2 Instagram\uc2  usernames). Empires have been built selling useless luxuries to rich people, and even if all that NFTs represented was a new class of luxury digital good, they would still be worth taking seriously as an emerging industry.\par \par \uc2 And what's with all these cartoon apes and penguins I see crypto people using as their \uc2 Twitter\uc2  avatars?\par \par \uc2 Those are what are known as community or pfp (profile picture) NFTs. Basically, they're a series of unique but thematically related NFTs, released in limited batches.\par \par \uc2 Once they're released or ''minted,'' these NFTs become a kind of digital collectible, and a membership card to an exclusive club. Many NFT groups have their own chat rooms on the Discord messaging app, where owners hang out and talk among themselves. Some community NFT projects even organize offline events and parties, which you can only get into by proving that you own one of their NFTs.\par \par \uc2 These community NFTs signal a kind of in-group status, and it's become customary for owners to display them as their \uc2 Twitter\uc2  profile picture, marking themselves as a Bored Ape or a Cool Cat, or whatever. And everyone in crypto world knows that NFTs from the most valuable collections sell for millions of dollars apiece, which is why you see celebrities like Jay-Z and Snoop Dogg showing off theirs on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But NFTs are just digital Beanie Babies, right? Aren't most of them going to end up being worthless?\par \par \uc2 That is the million dollar question. (Or, to be more precise, $40 billion, the estimated size of the NFT market.) It's possible that the people investing in NFTs are right -- that we're on the cusp of a revolution in the way digital goods are bought and sold, and that early NFTs will one day become as valuable as original Picassos and Monets.\par \par \uc2 But the NFT market appears to be cooling off these days, with falling transaction values and canceled auctions of high-dollar NFTs. Even some zealous NFT supporters are worried that the market has gotten oversaturated. Gary Vaynerchuk, the online marketer and a NFT mogul himself, recently predicted that 98 percent of NFTs would lose money.\par \par \uc2 98 percent!\par \par \uc2 Yeah. NFTs are controversial, even inside the crypto community. Some investors won't go near them, while others treat them as speculative gambles or buy them purely for fun.\par \par \uc2 And inside the NFT world, there's now an increasing focus on ''utility'' -- basically, bundling other things with an NFT purchase (like concert tickets, signed memorabilia or early access to future releases) to ensure there's something of value included, even if the value of the NFT itself goes to zero.\par \par \uc2 OK, but that still sounds kind of shady. Are there lots of scams in NFTs? What about money laundering?\par \par \uc2 Yes, there are tons of scams in NFTs. ''Rug pulls'' -- when a crypto developer abruptly abandons a project and runs away with buyers' money -- are a common experience. Several hyped projects have turned out to be rug pulls -- including Evolved Apes, an NFT scheme whose creator vanished along with $2.7 million.\par \par \uc2 In addition, many projects are corrupted by a practice called ''whitelisting,'' in which certain people are invited to buy their NFTs before they're available to the general public. Whitelisting means that many profits flow to well-connected insiders, who get their NFTs at a discount and can sell them for more once they're released publicly. A study by \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2  found that whitelisted users who resold their NFTs made a profit 75 percent of the time, versus 20 percent of the time for nonwhitelisted users.\par \par \uc2 Money laundering, wash trading -- a scheme that involves selling something to yourself in order to inflate its perceived value -- and other shady practices are almost certainly happening in the NFT market, too. It's not clear how often this happens, but it's a big enough risk that financial regulators in several countries, including China, have warned about the potential use of NFTs and other crypto assets for money laundering.\par \par \uc2 Of course, an NFT fan might argue that scams and money laundering happen in the regular economy, too. (The traditional art market, for example, is rife with money laundering, a Senate investigation found.) Crypto might just make it easier.\par \par \uc2 Let's back up for a minute, because I still have questions about NFTs and how they work. I saw a thread on \uc2 Twitter\uc2  that compared NFTs to those ''name a star'' gift collectibles, where all you get is an entry in a database saying that a star is named after you -- not any official claim to the star itself. Do NFTs actually include ownership or usage rights?\par \par \uc2 Not necessarily. In many NFT sales, what the buyer gets is simply the unique entry in the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  database that identifies them as the owner of the digital good -- the token, rather than the thing the token represents.\par \par \uc2 The person who bought the famous Nyan Cat NFT, for example, doesn't actually own the copyright to the Nyan Cat image, or the right to turn it into Nyan Cat merchandise. Its creator, Chris Torres, reserved those rights. All the NFT buyer got, in essence, was an ''official'' copy of the image that was cryptographically signed by Mr. Torres.\par \par \uc2 NFT creators can choose to include additional rights in an NFT sale. But they don't have to. And there have already been high-profile copyright disputes over NFTs, such as the lawsuit filed by Miramax against Quentin Tarantino last year, after Mr. Tarantino announced he would be auctioning off unpublished excerpts from the ''Pulp Fiction'' screenplay as NFTs.\par \par \uc2 I've also heard that NFTs get stolen a lot. Is that true?\par \par \uc2 Yes, there have been a number of NFT thefts in recent months, as the price of popular NFTs has climbed. Thieves recently targeted several members of the Bored Ape Yacht Club -- whose NFT cartoons of ennui-stricken apes often sell for six or seven figures apiece -- by tricking them into giving up the passwords to their crypto wallets. And hackers recently stole $1.7 million worth of NFTs from users of OpenSea, the largest NFT trading platform.\par \par \uc2 Another kind of theft -- the kind that involves creating NFTs out of copyrighted or protected material -- is also common. Many artists have complained about their work being turned into NFTs and sold as ''official'' versions without their permission. And while many platforms have tried to clamp down on the sale of stolen NFTs, some theft is probably inevitable given the lack of oversight in the market.\par \par \uc2 If NFTs are so flawed, why do so many people seem to be obsessed with them? What's the optimistic take that I'm missing?\par \par \uc2 I've spent a lot of time talking to NFT creators and collectors, and their pro-NFT argument generally boils down to a few main points:\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 The existing internet is too centralized, and NFTs could help decentralize it. Right now, most people who make media on the internet (artists, musicians, video game streamers, etc.) put their work on giant platforms like \uc2 Spotify\uc2 , \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2 . Those platforms are great for building an audience, but they're not great for making money. NFTs, they say, make it possible for creators to sell unique digital objects directly to their fans, keeping a much bigger chunk of the revenue for themselves. An artist like 3LAU might sell one album NFT to a superfan for $3.6 million, and make more money than they would have from a lifetime's worth of \uc2 Spotify\uc2  streams.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 We're entering the metaverse era -- an age in which more of our daily interactions and experiences will take place inside immersive digital worlds, rather than in offline physical spaces. Just as many kids today spend real dollars on Fortnite skins and \uc2 Roblox\uc2  accessories, adults who spend more of their days interacting in virtual spaces will buy all kinds of digital objects to enhance their lives, and many of those objects will take the form of NFTs.\par \par \uc2 \u226\'00\'E2\u8211\'20\'13\u160\'00\'A0 NFTs are still a brand-new technology, and we can't yet see all of the ways in which they will be used. Digital scarcity is a genuinely important concept that will open up an entirely new economy of unique digital goods, and we should be patient and open-minded while we wait to see what's going to be built with them.\par \par \uc2 Didn't we hear a lot of this ''creator economy'' stuff years ago, when people were optimistic about how platforms like \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  would make it possible for all these vloggers, gamers and musicians to make money online? Couldn't the NFT market end up consolidating under a few big companies, the way social media did?\par \par \uc2 It's certainly true that there are large platforms in the NFT world. (The biggest, OpenSea, is valued at $13.3 billion.) And some crypto fans have criticized these platforms for engaging in behavior that undermines their claims of decentralization, such as OpenSea's decision to delist certain NFTs that it deems stolen or fraudulent.\par \par \uc2 It's also true that NFT ownership is relatively centralized, in the sense that a small number of people appear to control the majority of high-value NFTs.\par \par \uc2 But a market with concentrated ownership is different from a market that runs on centralized technology. And there are some structural forces that could make it harder for big companies to seize control of the NFT market.\par \par \uc2 For starters, NFTs are personal property, in a way most other digital goods aren't. When you upload a video to \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , \uc2 YouTube\uc2  hosts that video on its servers and effectively makes all of the decisions related to that video -- whether it violates community guidelines, whether it's eligible to run ads, whether it gets recommended by the algorithm, and so on. But NFTs live in their owners' crypto wallets, which aren't chained to any particular platform, and they can use them any way they choose.\par \par \uc2 There's also the idea of interoperability. One feature of NFTs is that they can be made interoperable -- that is, unlike buying a skin in Fortnite that can only be used inside Fortnite, you can theoretically take NFTs with you from one virtual environment to another. An NFT sword you purchase in one video game might come in handy in a different game. Or a cartoon animal you've bought as an NFT could become your avatar in a V.R. metaverse app. And if you get mad at OpenSea, you can easily take your NFTs (which live in your crypto wallet, not on OpenSea's servers) and trade them on a different platform.\par \par \uc2 That kind of thing doesn't happen in social media. If you have a \uc2 YouTube\uc2  channel, you can't simply port your subscribers over to TikTok when you feel like it.\par \par \uc2 I'm an artist myself, actually. What if I want to switch from crafting to NFTs? Can I get in on this?\par \par \uc2 You can indeed go from selling knitwear on \uc2 Etsy\uc2  to selling an NFT of your wares on OpenSea, although there's no guarantee you'll make more money doing so. (And a substantial chance you won't.) Any digital file, more or less, can be turned into an NFT.\par \par \uc2 My experience as a seller is limited, but here's how it went for me: First, I used a browser extension called MetaMask to set up an empty crypto wallet. I used that wallet to open an account on Foundation, a NFT trading platform. Through Foundation, I ''minted,'' or created, my NFT, which involved uploading my file to a decentralized hosting service and creating a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based asset pointing to that file. Then I listed it for sale.\par \par \uc2 The whole process took a few hours, from start to finish -- not counting the many, many hours I spent convincing my bosses it wasn't a terrible idea -- although it did cost me roughly $100 in ''gas fees'' to mint the NFT.\par \par \uc2 I get the theoretical benefits of NFTs. But none of this is actually all that deep, right? Like, nobody is using NFTs in video games -- they're just buying them and hoping the price goes up.\par \par \uc2 I wouldn't say ''nobody.'' There are a few big NFT-based-games, like Axie Infinity, that allow players to earn real money by winning in-game battles using their NFT characters.\par \par \uc2 But it's reasonable to conclude that most of today's NFT activity is speculative, and that if another type of digital asset was routinely making people rich (or giving them fun communities of like-minded people to join), some people might stop trading NFTs and go trade those items instead.\par \par \uc2 Ultimately, the big selling point for NFTs isn't that they make trading digital goods easy and cheap (they don't), or that they're permanent and indestructible (the tokens may be, but the digital files they link to typically aren't), or even that they represent the future of intellectual property (we'll still need lawyers to hash out copyright disputes).\par \par \uc2 It's that they allow people to create and trade scarce digital objects -- for better or worse.\par \par \uc2 Go deeper:\par \par \uc2 ''What Critics Don't Understand About NFTs'' This article from The Atlantic, by Jonathan Zittrain and Will Marks of Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society, raises the question of what NFT investors are really buying, and unpacks the age-old philosophical question of why we value things.\par \par \uc2 ''How NFTs Are Building the Internet of the Future'' This 2021 TED Talk by Kayvon Tehranian -- the founder of the NFT platform Foundation -- makes the case that NFTs are the building blocks of ''an internet where economic control rests in the hands of creators, not platforms.''\par \par \uc2 ''Why NFTs Are Bad: The Long Version'' This 2021 blog post by the pseudonymous programmer Antsstyle is a novella-length takedown of NFTs, based on the claim that ''no system can ever prove ownership of anything.''\par \par \uc2 ''Line Goes Up: The Problem With NFTs'' If you prefer your NFT takedowns in video form, this \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video by Dan Olson is a two-hour exegesis on the flaws with NFTs and crypto more broadly, which went viral and racked up millions of views.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220320ei3k0006z\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Until fairly recently, if you lived anywhere other than San Francisco, it was possible to go days or even weeks without hearing about cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 Now, suddenly, it's inescapable. Look one way, and there are Matt Damon and Larry David doing ads for crypto start-ups. Swivel your head -- oh, hey, it's the mayors of Miami and New York City, arguing over who loves Bitcoin more. Two N.B.A. arenas are now named after crypto companies, and it seems as if every corporate marketing team in America has jumped on the NFT -- or nonfungible token -- bandwagon. (Can I interest you in one of Pepsi's ''Mic Drop'' genesis NFTs? Or maybe something from Applebee's ''Metaverse Meals'' NFT collection, inspired by the restaurant chain's ''iconic'' menu items?)\par \par \uc2 Crypto! For years, it seemed like the kind of fleeting tech trend most people could safely ignore, like hoverboards or Google Glass. But its power, both economic and cultural, has become too big to overlook. Twenty percent of American adults, and 36 percent of millennials, own cryptocurrency, according to a recent Morning Consult survey. \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , the crypto trading app, has landed on top of the App Store's charts at least twice in the past year. Today, the crypto market is valued at around $1.75 trillion -- roughly the size of \uc2 Google\uc2 . And in Silicon Valley, engineers and executives are bolting from cushy jobs in droves to join the crypto gold rush.\par \par \uc2 As it's gone mainstream, crypto has inspired an unusually polarized discourse. Its biggest fans are wild-eyed fanatics who think it's saving the world, while its biggest skeptics are convinced it's all a scam -- an environment-killing speculative bubble orchestrated by grifters and sold to greedy dupes, which will probably crash the economy when it bursts.\par \par \uc2 I've been writing about crypto for nearly a decade, a period in which my own views have whipsawed between extreme skepticism and cautious optimism. These days, I usually describe myself as a crypto moderate, although I admit that may be a cop-out.\par \par \uc2 I agree with the skeptics that much of the crypto market consists of overvalued, overhyped and possibly fraudulent assets, and I am unmoved by the most utopian pro-crypto sentiments (such as the claim by \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , the crypto-obsessed former \uc2 Twitter\uc2  chief, that Bitcoin will usher in world peace).\par \par \uc2 But as I've experimented more with crypto -- including accidentally selling an NFT for more than $500,000 in a charity auction last year -- I've come to accept that it isn't all a cynical money-grab, and that there are things of actual substance being built. I've also learned, in my career as a tech journalist, that when so much money, energy and talent flows toward a new thing, it's generally a good idea to pay attention, regardless of your views on the thing itself.\par \par \uc2 My strongest-held belief about crypto, though, is that it is terribly explained.\par \par \uc2 Recently, I spent several months reading everything I could about crypto. I found that most beginner's guides took the form of boring podcasts, thinly researched \uc2 YouTube\uc2  videos and blog posts written by hopelessly biased investors. Many anti-crypto takes, on the other hand, were undercut by inaccuracies and outdated arguments, such as the assertion that crypto is good for criminals, notwithstanding the growing evidence that crypto's traceable ledgers make it a poor fit for illicit activity.\par \par \uc2 What I couldn't find was a sober, dispassionate explanation of what crypto actually is -- how it works, who it's for, what's at stake, where the battle lines are drawn -- along with answers to some of the most common questions it raises.\par \par \uc2 This guide -- a mega-F.A.Q., really -- is an attempt to fix that. In it, I'll explain the basic concepts of crypto as clearly as I can, doing my best to answer the questions a curious but open-minded skeptic might pose.\par \par \uc2 Crypto boosters will likely quibble with my answers, while dug-in opponents may find them too generous. That's OK. My goal is not to convince you that crypto is good or bad, that it should be outlawed or celebrated, or that investing in it will make you rich or bankrupt you. It is simply to demystify things a bit. And if you want to go deeper, each section has a list of reading suggestions at the end.\par \par \uc2 Understanding crypto now -- especially for skeptics -- is important for a few reasons.\par \par \uc2 The first is that crypto wealth and ideology is going to be a transformative force in our society in the coming years.\par \par \uc2 You've heard about the overnight Dogecoin millionaires and Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros. But that's not the half of it. The crypto boom has generated vast new fortunes at a clip we've never seen before -- the closest comparison is probably the discovery of oil in the Middle East -- and has turned its biggest winners into some of the richest people in the world, essentially overnight. Some crypto riches could vanish if the market crashes, but enough has already been cashed out to ensure that crypto's influence will linger for decades.\par \par \uc2 Crypto's madcap, meme-crazed online culture can make it seem frivolous and shallow. It's not. Cryptocurrencies, even the jokey ones, are part of a robust, well-funded ideological movement that has serious implications for our political and economic future. Bitcoin, which emerged out of the ashes of the 2008 financial crisis, first caught on among libertarians and anti-establishment activists who saw it as the cornerstone of a new, incorruptible monetary system. Since then, other crypto realms have fashioned similarly lofty goals, like building a decentralized, largely unregulated version of Wall Street on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 We are already starting to see a swell of crypto money headed toward the U.S. political system. Crypto entrepreneurs are donating millions of dollars to candidates and causes, and lobbying firms have fanned out across the country to win support for pro-crypto legislation. In the coming years, crypto moguls will bankroll the campaigns of crypto-friendly candidates, or run for office themselves. Some will peddle influence in the familiar ways -- forming super PACs, funding think tanks, etc. -- while others will try to escape partisan gridlock altogether. (Crypto millionaires are already buying up land in the South Pacific to build their own \uc2 blockchain\uc2  utopias.)\par \par \uc2 Crypto is poised to soon become one of a handful of true wedge issues, with politicians all over the world forced to pick a side. Some countries, like El Salvador -- whose crypto-loving president, \uc2 Nayib Bukele\uc2 , recently announced the development of a ''Bitcoin City'' at the base of a volcano -- will go full crypto. Other governments may decide that crypto is a threat to their sovereignty and crack down, as China did when it outlawed cryptocurrency trading last year. The divide between the world's pro-crypto and no-crypto zones could end up being at least as big as the divide between the Chinese internet and the American one, and maybe even more consequential.\par \par \uc2 In America, we have already seen how crypto can scramble the usual partisan allegiances. Former President \uc2 Donald J. Trump\uc2  and Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democrat from Massachusetts, are united in crypto skepticism, for example, while Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, is in the same bullish camp as Senator \uc2 Ron Wyden\uc2 , the Democrat from Oregon. We have also seen what can happen when the crypto community feels politically threatened, as happened last summer, when crypto groups rallied to oppose a crypto-related provision in President Biden's infrastructure bill.\par \par \uc2 What I'm saying, I guess, is that despite the goofy veneer, crypto is not just another weird internet phenomenon. It's an organized technological movement, armed with powerful tools and hordes of wealthy true believers, whose goal is nothing less than revolution.\par \par \uc2 The second reason to pay attention to crypto is that understanding it now is the best way to ensure it doesn't become a destructive force later.\par \par \uc2 In the early 2010s, the most common knock on social media apps like \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  was that they just wouldn't work as businesses. Pundits predicted that users would eventually tire of their friends' vacation photos, that advertisers would flee and that the whole social media industry would collapse. The theory wasn't so much that social media was dangerous or bad; just that it was boring and corny, a hype-driven fad that would disappear as quickly as it had arrived.\par \par \uc2 What nobody was asking back then -- at least not loudly -- were questions like: What if social media is actually insanely successful? What kind of regulations would need to exist in a world where \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Twitter\uc2  were the dominant communication platforms? How should tech companies with billions of users weigh the trade-offs between free speech and safety? What product features could prevent online hate and misinformation from cascading into offline violence?\par \par \uc2 By the middle of the decade, when it was clear that these were urgent questions, it was too late. The platform mechanics and ad-based business models were already baked in, and skeptics -- who might have steered these apps in a better direction, if they'd taken them more seriously from the start -- were stuck trying to contain the damage.\par \par \uc2 Are we making the same mistake with crypto today? It's possible. No one knows yet whether crypto will or won't ''work,'' in the grandest sense. (Anyone who claims they do is selling something.) But there is real money and energy in it, and many tech veterans I've spoken to tell me that today's crypto scene feels, to them, like 2010 all over again -- with tech disrupting money this time, instead of media.\par \par \uc2 If they're wrong, they're wrong. But if they're right -- even partly -- the best time to start paying attention is now, before the paths are set and the problems are intractable.\par \par \uc2 The third reason to study up on crypto is that it can be genuinely fun to learn about.\par \par \uc2 Sure, a lot of it is dumb, shady or self-refuting. But if you can look past the carnival barkers and parse the convoluted jargon, you'll find a bottomless well of weird, interesting and thought-provoking projects. The crypto agenda is so huge and multidisciplinary -- drawing together elements of economics, engineering, philosophy, law, art, energy policy and more -- that it offers lots of footholds for beginners. Want to discuss the influence of Austrian economics in Bitcoin development? There's probably a Discord server for that. Want to join a DAO that invests in NFTs, or play a video game that pays you in crypto tokens for winning? Dive right in.\par \par \uc2 Mind you, I am not suggesting that the crypto world is diverse, in the demographic sense. Surveys have suggested that high-earning white men make up a large share of crypto owners, and libertarians with dog-eared copies of ''Atlas Shrugged'' are likely overrepresented among crypto millionaires. But it's not an intellectual monolith. There are right-wing Bitcoin maximalists who believe that crypto will liberate them from government tyranny; left-wing Ethereum fans who want to overthrow the big banks; and speculators with no ideological attachments who just want to turn a profit and get out. These communities fight with one another constantly, and many have wildly different ideas about what crypto should be. It makes for fascinating study, especially with a bit of emotional distance.\par \par \uc2 And if you do learn some crypto basics, you might find that a whole world opens up to you. You'll understand why Jimmy Fallon and Steph Curry are changing their \uc2 Twitter\uc2  avatars to cartoon apes, and why \uc2 Elon Musk\uc2 , the richest man in the world, spent a decent chunk of last year tweeting about a digital currency named after a dog. Strange words and phrases you encounter on the internet -- rug pulls, flippenings, ''gm'' -- will become familiar, and eventually, headlines like ''NFT Collector Sells People's Fursonas for $100K In Right-Click Mindset War'' won't make you wonder if you're losing your grip on reality.\par \par \uc2 Crypto can also be a kind of generational skeleton key -- maybe the single fastest way to freshen your cultural awareness and decipher the beliefs and actions of today's young people. I might argue that, just as knowing a little about New Age mysticism and psychedelics would help someone trying to make sense of youth culture in the 1960s, knowing some crypto basics can help someone perplexed by emerging attitudes about money and power feel more grounded.\par \par \uc2 Again, I don't really care whether you emerge from these explainers as a true believer, a devoted skeptic or something in between. Participate or abstain as you wish! All I'm after is understanding -- and possibly, a little relief from the question that has consumed my social and professional life for the past several years:\par \par \uc2 ''So ... can I ask you a question about crypto?''\par \par \uc2 Design and production by Sean Catangui and Gray Beltran.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Let's start on the ground floor. This is the foundation of what you need to know.\par \par \uc2 Welcome to ''The Latecomer's Guide to Crypto,'' a mega-F.A.Q. about cryptocurrency and its offshoots. Kevin Roose, a Times technology columnist, is answering some of the most frequently asked questions he gets about NFTs, DAOs, DeFi, web3 and other crypto concepts. You can view the rest of the series here.\par \par \uc2 Let's start from the beginning: What is crypto?\par \par \uc2 A decade or two ago, the word was generally used as shorthand for cryptography. But in recent years, it's been more closely associated with cryptocurrencies. These days, ''crypto'' usually refers to the entire universe of technologies that involve blockchains -- the distributed ledger systems that power digital currencies like Bitcoin, but also serve as the base layer of technology for things like NFTs, web3 applications and DeFi trading protocols.\par \par \uc2 Ah yes, blockchains. Can you remind me, without going into too much technical detail, what they are?\par \par \uc2 At a very basic level, blockchains are shared databases that store and verify information in a cryptographically secure way.\par \par \uc2 You can think of a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  like a \uc2 Google\uc2  spreadsheet, except that instead of being hosted on \uc2 Google\uc2 's servers, blockchains are maintained by a network of computers all over the world. These computers (sometimes called miners or validators) are responsible for storing their own copies of the database, adding and verifying new entries, and securing the database against hackers.\par \par \uc2 So blockchains are ... fancy \uc2 Google\uc2  spreadsheets?\par \par \uc2 Sort of! But there are at least three important conceptual differences.\par \par \uc2 First, a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  is decentralized. It doesn't need a company like \uc2 Google\uc2  overseeing it. All of that work is done by the computers on the network, using what's called a consensus mechanism -- basically, a complicated algorithm that allows them to agree on what's in a database without the need for a neutral referee. This makes blockchains more secure than traditional record-keeping systems, proponents believe, since no single person or company can take down the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  or alter its contents, and anyone trying to hack or change the records in the ledger would need to break into many computers simultaneously.\par \par \uc2 The second major feature of blockchains is that they're typically public and open source, meaning that unlike a \uc2 Google\uc2  spreadsheet, anyone can inspect a public \uc2 blockchain\uc2 's code or see a record of any transaction. (There are private blockchains, but they're less important than the public ones.)\par \par \uc2 Third, blockchains are typically append-only and permanent, meaning that unlike with a \uc2 Google\uc2  spreadsheet, data that's added to a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  typically can't be deleted or changed after the fact.\par \par \uc2 Got it. So blockchains are public, permanent databases that nobody owns?\par \par \uc2 You're getting it!\par \par \uc2 Now remind me: How are blockchains related to cryptocurrencies?\par \par \uc2 Blockchains didn't really exist until 2009, when a pseudonymous programmer named \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2  released the technical documentation for Bitcoin, the first-ever cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 Bitcoin used a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  to keep track of transactions. That was notable because, for the first time, it allowed people to send and receive money over the internet without needing to involve a central authority, such as a bank or an app like \uc2 PayPal\uc2  or Venmo.\par \par \uc2 Many blockchains still perform cryptocurrency transactions, and there are now roughly 10,000 different cryptocurrencies in existence, according to CoinMarketCap. But many blockchains can be used to store other kinds of information, too -- including NFTs, bits of self-executing code known as smart contracts and full-fledged apps -- without the need for a central authority.\par \par \uc2 OK, but can we back up a second? Weren't tech people telling us, years ago, that crypto was a new and exciting form of money? And yet, nobody I know pays their rent or buys groceries in Bitcoin. So were those people just ... wrong?\par \par \uc2 Good question. It's true that today, hardly anyone pays for things in cryptocurrency. In part, that's because most merchants still don't accept crypto payments, and hefty transaction fees can make it impractical to spend small amounts of cryptocurrency on daily living expenses. It's also because the value of popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether has historically gone up, making it somewhat risky to use them for offline purchases. (The counterexamples are usually cited with pity, like the guy who, in 2010, bought two Papa John's pizzas using Bitcoin that was worth about $40 at the time, but would be worth roughly $400 million today.)\par \par \uc2 It's also true that the value of cryptocurrencies has grown enormously since the early Bitcoin days, despite them not being most people's daily spending money.\par \par \uc2 Part of that growth is speculation -- people buying crypto assets in hopes of selling them for more later on. Part of it is because the blockchains that have emerged since Bitcoin, like Ethereum and Solana, have expanded what can be done with this technology.\par \par \uc2 And some crypto fans believe that the prices of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin will eventually stabilize, which could make them more useful as a means of payment.\par \par \uc2 What are the actual uses of crypto, beyond financial speculation?\par \par \uc2 Right now, many of the successful applications for crypto technology are in finance or finance-adjacent fields. For example, people are using crypto to send cross-border remittances to family members abroad and Wall Street banks using blockchains to settle foreign transactions.\par \par \uc2 The crypto boom has also led to an explosion of experiments outside of financial services. There are crypto social clubs, crypto video games, crypto restaurants and even crypto-powered wireless networks.\par \par \uc2 These non-financial uses are still fairly limited. But crypto fans often make the case that the technology is still young, and that it took the internet decades to mature into what it is today. Investors are pouring billions of dollars into crypto start-ups because they think that someday, blockchains will be used for all kinds of things: storing medical records, tracking streaming music rights, even hosting new social media platforms. And the crypto ecosystem is attracting tons of developers -- an auspicious sign for any new technology.\par \par \uc2 I've heard people calling crypto a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme. What do they mean?\par \par \uc2 Some critics believe that cryptocurrency markets are fundamentally fraudulent, either because early investors get rich at the expense of late investors (a pyramid scheme), or because crypto projects lure in unsuspecting investors with promises of safe returns, then collapse once new money stops coming in (a Ponzi scheme).\par \par \uc2 There are certainly plenty of examples of pyramid and Ponzi schemes within crypto. They include \uc2 OneCoin\uc2 , a fraudulent crypto operation that stole $4 billion from investors from 2014 to 2019; and Virgil Sigma Fund, a $90 million crypto hedge fund run by a 24-year-old investor who pleaded guilty to securities fraud and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.\par \par \uc2 But these cases aren't usually what critics are talking about. They're generally arguing that crypto itself is an exploitative scheme, with no real-world value.\par \par \uc2 And are they right?\par \par \uc2 Well, let's try to understand the case they're making.\par \par \uc2 Unlike buying stock in, say, \uc2 Apple\uc2 , a purchase that (theoretically, at least) reflects a belief that \uc2 Apple\uc2 's underlying business is healthy, buying a cryptocurrency is more like betting on the success of an idea, they say. If people believe in Bitcoin, they buy, and Bitcoin prices go up. If people stop believing in Bitcoin, they sell, and Bitcoin prices go down.\par \par \uc2 Crypto owners, then, have a rational incentive to convince other people to buy. And if you don't think that cryptocurrency technology is inherently valuable, you might conclude that the entire thing resembles a pyramid scheme, in which you primarily make money by recruiting others to join.\par \par \uc2 I'm sensing a ''but'' coming on.\par \par \uc2 But! Even though there are scams and frauds within crypto, and crypto investors are certainly fond of trying to recruit other people to buy in, many investors will tell you that they are going in with their eyes wide open.\par \par \uc2 They believe that crypto technology is inherently valuable, and that the ability to store information and value on a decentralized \uc2 blockchain\uc2  will be attractive to all kinds of people and businesses in the future. They would tell you they're betting on crypto the product, not crypto the idea -- which, on some level, isn't all that different from buying \uc2 Apple\uc2  stock because you think the next iPhone is going to be popular.\par \par \uc2 Matt Huang, a prominent investor, spoke for many crypto fans when he said on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 : ''Crypto may look like a speculative casino from the outside. But that distracts many from the deeper truth: the casino is a trojan horse with a new financial system hidden inside.''\par \par \uc2 You can argue with that position, or dispute how much this ''new financial system'' is actually worth. But crypto investors clearly believe it's worth something.\par \par \uc2 Is crypto regulated?\par \par \uc2 Only slightly. In the United States, certain centralized crypto exchanges, such as \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , are required to register as money transmitters and follow laws like the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires them to collect certain information about their customers. Some countries have passed more stringent regulations, and others, like China, have banned cryptocurrency trading entirely.\par \par \uc2 But compared with the traditional financial system, crypto is very lightly regulated. There are few rules governing crypto assets like ''stablecoins'' -- coins whose value is pegged to government-backed currencies -- or even clear guidance from the \uc2 Internal Revenue Service\uc2  about how certain crypto investments should be taxed. And certain areas of crypto, like DeFi (decentralized finance), are almost completely unregulated.\par \par \uc2 Partly, that's because it's still early, and making new rules takes time. But it's also a property of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology itself, much of which was designed to be hard for governments to control.\par \par \uc2 This question comes from the (apparently crypto-curious) rapper Cardi B : Is crypto going to replace the dollar?\par \par \uc2 Sorry, Cardi. The dollar is the world's reserve currency, and dislodging it would be a huge, costly project that isn't likely to happen any time soon. (To give just one small example of the enormity of the task: every financial contract that is denominated in dollars would have to be re-denominated in Bitcoin or Ether or some other cryptocurrency.)\par \par \uc2 There are also technical hurdles crypto needs to overcome if it's ever going to displace government-issued currency. Today, the most popular blockchains -- Bitcoin and Ethereum -- are slow and inefficient compared with traditional payment networks. (The Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , for example, can process only about 15 transactions per second, whereas \uc2 Visa\uc2  says it can process thousands of credit card transactions per second.)\par \par \uc2 And, of course, for a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin to replace the dollar, you'd need to convince billions of people to use a currency whose value fluctuates wildly, that isn't backed by a government and that often can't be retrieved if it's stolen.\par \par \uc2 What kind of people are investing in crypto? Is it all -- to quote a recent ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' episode -- ''nerds and Nazis?''\par \par \uc2 It's hard to say who's investing in crypto, especially since a lot of activity takes place anonymously or under pseudonyms. But some surveys and studies have suggested that crypto is still dominated by affluent white men.\par \par \uc2 Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange, estimated in a recent report that women made up only 26 percent of crypto investors. The average crypto owner, the group found, was a 38-year-old man making approximately $111,000 a year.\par \par \uc2 But crypto ownership does appear to be diversifying. A 2021 \uc2 Pew Research Center\uc2  survey found that Asian, Black and Latino adults were more likely to have used crypto than white adults. Crypto adoption is also growing outside the United States, and some studies have suggested that crypto adoption is growing fastest in countries like Vietnam, India and Pakistan.\par \par \uc2 My colleague, Tressie McMillan Cottom, has made the case that crypto -- because it relies on permanent, irrefutable records of ownership of digital goods and currencies -- is particularly attractive to people from marginalized groups, who may have had their property unjustly taken from them in the past.\par \par \uc2 ''If I live in a community where the police absolutely use eminent domain to claim my private property and I cannot do anything about it,'' she wrote, ''that sense of everyday powerlessness would make the promise of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  sound pretty good.''\par \par \uc2 That said, some recent studies have also found that a small number of people own the vast majority of crypto wealth -- so it's not necessarily an egalitarian paradise.\par \par \uc2 And what about extremists? Are they into crypto?\par \par \uc2 Some are. Because you can buy and sell cryptocurrency without using your name or having a bank account, crypto in its early days was a natural fit for people who had reasons to avoid the traditional financial system. They included criminals, tax evaders and people buying and selling illicit goods. They also included political dissidents and extremists, some of whom had been kicked off more mainstream payment services like \uc2 PayPal\uc2  and Patreon.\par \par \uc2 As a result of their well-timed entry into the crypto market, some extremists have gotten rich. A recent investigation by the \uc2 Southern Poverty Law Center\uc2  found that several prominent white supremacists have made hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars by investing in crypto.\par \par \uc2 Of course, there are millions of crypto owners, the vast majority of whom are not white supremacists. And the same properties of anonymity and censorship-resistance that make crypto useful to white supremacists might also make it attractive to, say, Afghan citizens fleeing the \uc2 Taliban\uc2 . So labeling the entire crypto movement an extremist group would be overkill. Regardless, it's safe to say that crypto has become attractive to all kinds of people who would rather not deal (or can't legally deal) with a traditional bank.\par \par \uc2 Another criticism I've heard is that crypto is bad for the environment. Is that true?\par \par \uc2 This is a real can of worms -- and one of the most frequent objections to crypto.\par \par \uc2 Let's start with what we know for sure. It's true that most crypto activity today takes place on blockchains that require large amounts of energy to store and verify transactions. These networks use a ''proof-of-work'' consensus mechanism -- a process that has been compared to a global guessing game, played by computers all competing to solve cryptographic puzzles in order to add new information to the database and earn a reward in return. Solving these puzzles requires powerful computers, which in turn use lots of energy.\par \par \uc2 The Bitcoin \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , for example, uses an estimated 200 terawatt-hours of energy per year, according to Digiconomist, a website that tracks crypto energy usage. That's comparable to the annual energy consumption of Thailand. And Bitcoin's associated carbon emissions have been estimated at roughly 100 megatons per year, which is comparable to the carbon footprint of the Czech Republic.\par \par \uc2 Holy moly! How do crypto fans justify that kind of environmental impact?\par \par \uc2 Crypto advocates often quibble with these statistics. They also argue that:\par \par \uc2 Our existing financial system also uses a lot of energy, between powering millions of bank branches, A.T.M.s that sit idle for most of the day, gold mines and other energy-intensive infrastructure.\par \par \uc2 Many crypto-mining computers are already powered by renewable energy sources, or by energy that would otherwise be wasted.\par \par \uc2 Most newer blockchains are built using consensus mechanisms that require much less energy than proof-of-work. (Ethereum, for example, is scheduled to switch to a new type of consensus mechanism called proof-of-stake sometime in 2022, which could reduce its energy usage by as much as 99.5 percent.)\par \par \uc2 And are those arguments valid?\par \par \uc2 Partly. It's true that most newer blockchains are designed in a way that requires considerably less energy than Bitcoin, and that Ethereum's switch to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism will greatly shrink its environmental footprint, if and when it happens.\par \par \uc2 But it's also a bit convenient to steer attention away from Bitcoin, which is still the most valuable cryptocurrency in the world. Bitcoin's energy needs aren't expected to fall significantly anytime soon. And even if every Bitcoin miner ran entirely on renewable energy -- which, to be clear, isn't the case -- there would still be an environmental cost associated with maintaining the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 All told, it's clear that crypto as we know it today has a significant environmental impact, but it's hard to measure exactly how significant. Many frequently-cited statistics come from industry groups, and it's hard to find trustworthy, independent data and analysis.\par \par \uc2 But few crypto fans would dispute that blockchains consume substantially more energy than a traditional, centralized database would -- just as 100 refrigerators use more energy than one refrigerator. They just argue that crypto's environmental impact will shrink over time, and that the benefits of decentralization are worth the costs.\par \par \uc2 Got it. And those benefits, again, are ...\par \par \uc2 Some crypto proponents will tell you that the biggest benefit of decentralization is the ability to create currencies, apps and virtual economies that are resistant to censorship and top-down control. (Imagine a version of \uc2 Facebook\uc2 , they'll say, in which \uc2 Mark Zuckerberg\uc2  couldn't unilaterally decide to kick people off.)\par \par \uc2 Others will say that the biggest perk of decentralization is that it allows artists and creators to control their own economic destinies more directly by giving them a way (in the form of NFTs and other crypto assets) to bypass platform gatekeepers like \uc2 YouTube\uc2  and \uc2 Spotify\uc2 , and sell unique digital works directly to their fans.\par \par \uc2 Still others will say that crypto is most useful to people who don't live in countries with stable currencies, or to dissident groups living under authoritarian regimes.\par \par \uc2 There are a million other hypothetical benefits of decentralization and crypto, some of which are realistic and some of which probably aren't.\par \par \uc2 How do you actually use crypto? Is it like sending a payment over \uc2 Paypal\uc2  or Venmo?\par \par \uc2 It can be. The quickest way to get started using cryptocurrencies is to set up an account with a crypto exchange like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2 , which can link to your bank account and convert your U.S. dollars (or other government-issued currency) into cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 But many crypto users prefer setting up their own ''wallets'' -- secure places to store the cryptographic keys that unlock their digital assets.\par \par \uc2 Once you've got some crypto in your wallet, the process can be pretty simple -- just type in the recipient's crypto wallet address, pay a transaction fee (if applicable), and wait for the payment to clear.\par \par \uc2 OK, I'm ready to dive into the rest of your explainers. But first, I have one final question about crypto's culture: Why is it so weird and insular?\par \par \uc2 This is maybe the question I get asked most about crypto. People see their friends, co-workers and relatives diving down the crypto rabbit hole and emerging days or weeks later with a new obsession, new internet friends, a bunch of new jargon and the seeming inability to talk about anything else. (There's even a word for this -- getting ''cryptopilled.'') People who believe in crypto tend to really believe in it -- to the point that they can appear to the outside world more like evangelists for a new religion than fans of a new technology.\par \par \uc2 I was a religion reporter once, and I don't think the comparison is totally inapt. (It's also not necessarily a bad thing: Plenty of people find meaning and community and intellectual stimulation in religion.) As people like the \uc2 Bloomberg\uc2  journalist Joe Weisenthal have pointed out, crypto has similar elements to an emerging religion: an enigmatic founder (the still-anonymous \uc2 Satoshi Nakamoto\uc2 ), sacred texts (the Bitcoin white paper) and rituals and rites to mark yourself as a believer, such as tweeting ''gm,'' (crypto speak for ''good morning'') to your fellow believers, or photoshopping laser eyes onto your profile picture.\par \par \uc2 It's fun to laugh at the (often cringeworthy) ways crypto fans try to entertain and inspire each other. But focusing too much on their behavior and customs might mean missing what's genuinely novel -- and, depending on where you sit, either exciting or dangerous -- about the technology itself. Which is why, when my friends ask me how to talk to their cryptopilled relatives, I advise them to start by trying to understand what's gotten them so excited in the first place.\par \par \uc2 Go deeper:\par \par \uc2 ''WTF Is the \uc2 Blockchain\uc2 ?'' In this basic explainer of \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology, Mohit Mamoria looks into how blockchains work and the problems they're intended to solve.\par \par \uc2 ''Introduction to \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  and Money'' This \uc2 YouTube\uc2  video, which explains the history and technical underpinnings of crypto, is the first lecture in a course taught at M.I.T. in 2018 by Gary Gensler, who is now the chief of the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 . (The rest of the course is also on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , and makes for interesting viewing.)\par \par \uc2 ''A Normie's Guide to Becoming a Crypto Person'' This New York Magazine article by Sara Harrison is a 101-level guide to crypto culture, including a glossary of terms and explanations of the many crypto subcommunities.\par \par \uc2 ''Digital Gold'' Nathaniel Popper, my former Times colleague, offers a deep dive into the history of Bitcoin and the origins of the crypto economy in his 2015 book.\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220320ei3k0004t\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTD\par \b \uc2 Building a New Community\b0\par\par\uc2 By Anna P. Kambhampaty and Sapna Maheshwari \par \uc2 1,496 \uc2 words\par \uc2 17 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The Outdoor Voices founder has a new venture that aims to reward customers with \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based assets. But do brand loyalists really want NFTs?\par \par \uc2 It would probably be a stretch to say that Ty Haney changed the way we work out. She didn't start a boutique fitness craze; she's not Jane Fonda. But Outdoor Voices, the athleisure company she founded in 2014, helped to popularize a fitness paradigm that has more to do with everyday movement than the body-stressing athleticism advertised by brands like \uc2 Nike\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Outdoor Voices built a following with color-blocked compression leggings and all-in-one exercise dresses that could easily transition from gym to brunch. On social media, fans boasted about buying items in every shade and posted pictures of themselves #DoingThings in scenic locales while wearing matching sets. They also shared feedback on new styles and colorways in online forums. It was a customer-loyalty fairy tale.\par \par \uc2 Though she is no longer with Outdoor Voices, Ms. Haney, 33, is hoping to bring its tenets of community building and consumer engagement into a new sphere: the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based future of the internet known as web3. She's betting that in the next phase of online retail, ''minting things'' will be the new ''doing things.''\par \par \uc2 Her latest venture, a platform called Try Your Best, will enable brands to collect input from customers in exchange for rewards such as digital collectibles (NFTs) and brand coins that can be used for bragging rights or toward purchases. These are assets, Ms. Haney said, that could potentially have lasting value, as opposed to the one-time discount codes and fleeting perks most companies offer loyalists.\par \par \uc2 ''The idea is that brands and fans build together, and the concept is to share value with those who create it,'' Ms. Haney said in an interview.\par \par \uc2 Direct-to-consumer brands have typically relied on disparate sources to solicit feedback from their most engaged customers: \uc2 Google\uc2  Docs, \uc2 Slack\uc2  bases, DMs. Try Your Best aims to streamline that process, and to route marketing dollars away from \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , where Ms. Haney said that soaring costs have made it harder for emerging brands to grow.\par \par \uc2 So far, 10 brands have signed up for Try Your Best's pilot program, the company said, including Hill House Home, whose ''nap dresses'' became the height of pandemic loungewear, and Vada, a jewelry and eyewear company. But at the start, the only brand on the platform will be Joggy, a new brand led by Ms. Haney that sells products containing CBD and THCV.\par \par \uc2 She said that Try Your Best hopes to reach ''the Parade customer, the JuneShine customer, the Glossier customer -- these millennial, Gen Z-type audiences.''\par \par \uc2 The target users are ''the people who buy a brand because they love it and post about it on \uc2 Instagram\uc2 ,'' said Sean Judge, a general partner at Castle Island Ventures, which specializes in \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -related investments and put $2 million into Try Your Best -- a modest figure compared with Outdoor Voices' fund-raising. ''This is a way for them to connect with others in that community and also have a direct relationship with brands to provide real-time feedback around new product ideas and where the brand should head.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Haney said that involving consumers in design decisions helped drive the success behind some of Outdoor Voices's most popular products. ''The way that we got people to buy every color -- 25 colors -- of the exercise dress was by bringing them upstream in the product creation process,'' she said, but ''there was really no centralized tool for this type of interaction.''\par \par \uc2 Casey Lewis, a trend researcher who writes about youth culture in her Substack newsletter, After School, was intrigued by the idea of brands rethinking customer loyalty but circumspect about the appeal of digital assets.\par \par \uc2 ''Any time a brand can successfully build a community, it's a huge win for them. But it's so, so hard to manufacture or force that success,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''The biggest question is: Do people care about NFTs, and will that be enough to get them involved and excited?''\par \par \uc2 Web3 has been billed, often in vague and utopian terms, as an online ecosystem where users will wrest power from the tech behemoths that dominate the current phase of the internet, Web 2.0.\par \par \uc2 Kevin Werbach\uc2 , a professor at the \uc2 Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\uc2  and the author of ''The \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  and the New Architecture of Trust,'' said that while ''granting strong ownership rights directly to users'' could potentially shift the balance of power, none of web3's promises are guaranteed.\par \par \uc2 ''There's a web3 that's out there which is wonderful and trying to make the world a better place, but just by labeling something web3, it doesn't mean power dynamics will magically reverse,'' Professor Werbach said.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Haney is especially interested in bringing women into web3. ''We're seeing a predominantly male demo on Reddit and in Discords, telling each other about all of these opportunities,'' she said. ''By bringing brands that do have a large female audience base into crypto, that's a really big opportunity.''\par \par \uc2 Try Your Best runs on the Avalanche \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , which Ms. Haney said she chose in part because its transactions use significantly less energy than, say, Bitcoin or Ethereum. (Even supposedly ''green'' mining operations, however, are much more energy intensive than other financial transactions.)\par \par \uc2 Try Your Best plans to make money by collecting a monthly fee from brands and potentially sharing in revenue when tokens were used to drive sales.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Judge, the investor, previously worked with a range of direct-to-consumer companies, and heard constant frustration from them about the escalating costs of advertising to customers on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . Ms. Haney ''experienced these pain points firsthand,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Outdoor Voices was a huge success. Ms. Haney and the company were the subject of a glowing feature in The New Yorker that compared Outdoor Voices to \uc2 Lululemon\uc2 , and it raised more than $50 million in venture capital. It also attracted the attention of \uc2 Mickey Drexler\uc2 , the retail legend who led transformations at Gap and J. Crew. He became chairman of the board and drew investors to the brand.\par \par \uc2 But just before the pandemic hit the United States, Ms. Haney's successful run at Outdoor Voices came to a screeching halt as investors questioned her leadership. A schism had opened between the young founder and Mr. Drexler, costly store openings were delayed, and a string of experienced retail executives left the company, which struggled with a relocation to Austin, Texas, from New York. The internal troubles were detailed in articles in \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  and BuzzFeed News.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Haney recalled thinking at the time, ''My life is going to be over.''\par \par \uc2 But as the news cycle moved on, so did she. ''It sucked but it didn't kill me, and it gave me that much more energy to go build again and show I can set vision and execute against it,'' she said. ''It feels good to take full accountability.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Haney resigned from the brand in the investor tumult in February 2020 and then rejoined two months later with the title founder. In January 2021, she left the company and the board to pursue projects including Try Your Best. She still retains a stake in Outdoor Voices.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Judge was not concerned with Ms. Haney's tussle with investors at Outdoor Voices, and viewed it as a vote of confidence that several former employees of the firm have since joined her at Try Your Best.\par \par \uc2 ''There's challenges with every type of business, and some are more public than others,'' Mr. Judge said. ''I think Ty learned an incredible amount about building a business.''\par \par \uc2 Ms. Haney said that her start-up is arriving at a time when the traditional direct-to-consumer model -- which has built businesses like \uc2 Warby Parker\uc2 , Everlane and Glossier -- is ''broken'' after years of overreliance on social marketing.\par \par \uc2 At one point, she said, Outdoor Voices was devoting about 30 percent of its total funding to acquiring customers on \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 . She's hoping Try Your Best can help brands lower those costs.\par \par \uc2 Separately, as younger people may be less willing to hand over their thoughts and time for free, Try Your Best offers an answer to the question of how to pay them back.\par \par \uc2 ''One thing with Gen Z is they want to be rewarded for their input and advice,'' Ms. Lewis said. ''This is not a generation who is willing to do things just for the heck of it.''\par \par \uc2 Ty Haney has a project on web3, the \uc2 -based future of the internet.

\par\par \uc2 Style Desk; SECTST\par \b \uc2 More Art Than Science\b0\par\par\uc2 By Alyson Krueger \par \uc2 1,837 \uc2 words\par \uc2 13 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 8\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 NFTs are making some collectors and artists rich, but success in this high-risk marketplace is more art than science.\par \par \uc2 Late on a Friday last spring, Izzy Pollak decided to buy two Bored Ape NFTs, which -- as a reminder for the many people thinking, Yeah, but I still don't know what an NFT is -- means he bought unique, digital images (in this case, of apes).\par \par \uc2 As the owner of a Bored Ape, he now has commercial rights over the digital image to do with as he wishes. Many people choose to display their NFTs as their profile picture on social media accounts.\par \par \uc2 (And if you're wondering how ownership of a digital asset can be proven: Every NFT, or non-fungible token, has a distinct serial number, and the transaction history of each NFT is stored on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 , so people can see who the real owner is.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pollak, 29, who bought three more a few months later, obtained these from a collection of 10,000 NFTs known as the Bored Ape Yacht Club. Some of the apes are wearing gold jackets or animal-print tunics. Others are smoking cigars or smiling widely.\par \par \uc2 At the time, Mr. Pollak, who works for Genies, a tech start-up in Los Angeles that makes NFTs and avatars, didn't have a lot of disposable income. ''I was living in a four-bedroom townhouse with three other people,'' he said. ''We all shared a bathroom. It felt like college life.''\par \par \uc2 He didn't come from money, either. During the 2008 financial crisis, Mr. Pollak said, when he was 16, his mother couldn't pay the mortgage, so he and his family had to rent an apartment.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Pollak's interest in NFTs was spurred by hearing people talk about them on Clubhouse. ''I was like, 'Oh my God, this is insane. I'm about to spend hundreds of dollars on a picture of a monkey,''' he said.\par \par \uc2 Turns out it was a wise decision. Last fall, several months after he had bought his first NFTs, Mr. Pollak's apes skyrocketed in value. He sold one that he had bought for approximately 14 Ether (a virtual currency that was worth about $40,000 on the day of the purchase) for around 70 Ether (approximately $231,000 on the day of sale).\par \par \uc2 He used the money for a down payment on a three-bedroom house in Los Angeles with a backyard. ''We call it the Chimp Chalet,'' he said, laughing. ''I always wanted to own a house but never thought I could make it work.''\par \par \uc2 He now has three Bored Ape NFTs in his portfolio. He hasn't sold them yet, but he will one day. For the first time in his life he feels financially well-off.\par \par \uc2 A fortunate handful of people now have their very own rags-to-riches stories thanks to NFTs. By investing in the right project at the right time, some collectors and digital artists have made ''life-changing money,'' said Matt Medved, a founder of Nft Now, a digital media publication about NFTs. Some are using the funds to pay off student loans, buy a home or quit jobs they hated. (Some people, of course, are also buying yachts or throwing lavish parties.)\par \par \uc2 ''NFTs are like manna from heaven,'' said Mr. Pollak, who also acknowledges how lucky he is. ''I've heard horror stories of people spending their rent money on NFTs. It's heartbreaking to see people risk their money when it doesn't usually work out.''\par \par \uc2 Most people who make or buy NFTs never turn a profit. There is no regulation or consumer protection, and trading them is basically as risky as gambling. Investing in cryptocurrency is high risk and involves a lot of technical know-how and luck; few financial professionals would recommend it, and scams are aplenty.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Medved encourages people to think of NFTs like baseball cards. ''For generations our society has accepted that rare baseball cards have value,'' he said. ''There is a rare Mickey Mantle card that probably costs 5 cents to make that sold for $5.2 million last year. And why? It's not about the physical piece of card stock. It's the history, the rarity, the scarcity, the cultural relevance.''\par \par \uc2 ''It comes down to fandom,'' he added.\par \par \uc2 Similarly, what many NFT artists create or collectors invest in will be worth little or nothing in the long term. But there are a few NFTs that have become very valuable and have earned their owners and creators a vast sum of money in a short period of time.\par \par \uc2 The Bored Apes that Mr. Pollak bought, for example, could be minted -- i.e. go to market -- at .08 Ether ($200 last spring). Now, less than a year later, the cheapest one is worth about 73 Ether (about $190,000). (Ether can be converted to cash on major cryptocurrency platforms like \uc2 Coinbase\uc2  and Gemini and then transferred to a bank account.)\par \par \uc2 Claire Silver, an artist in her early 30s who works with artificial intelligence, is another NFT success story. In 2017, she was given three CryptoPunks, a collection of 10,000 unique pixel art characters generated from an algorithm, by someone she met on \uc2 Slack\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''I was in a chat room about cryptocurrency, and I met this guy who was interested in art,'' said Ms. Silver, who lives a nomadic lifestyle but most recently lived in Denver. He told her he had 730 CryptoPunks, she said, ''and asked if I wanted three. I said, 'Sure.'''\par \par \uc2 In 2017, collectors could claim CryptoPunks for free as long as they had an Etherum wallet. Now the cheapest one is selling for around 68 Ether (almost $175,000).\par \par \uc2 She held on to hers until 2020 when she heard rumblings that they were selling for a lot of money. She sold one in July 2021 for about $60,000 and still has two others. (Many are selling for six figures. One sold last month for almost $600,000.)\par \par \uc2 Ms. Silver also makes her own NFTs. She, like all NFT artists, earns money from the original sale and may receive 10 percent of every secondary sale. One of her pieces sold for 15 Ether ($63,000 at the time).\par \par \uc2 She has saved so much that she finally feels financially secure, at least for now. ''This amount of money is a big deal to me because I come from poverty. We had to accept church donations for food growing up,'' she said. ''The other day I walked into \uc2 Walmart\uc2  and was like, 'I can buy the cheese, I can buy the good coffee.' I had never experienced that freedom before.''\par \par \uc2 She recently returned from a trip to Britain, where \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  was auctioning her work, and has a trip planned to Japan.\par \par \uc2 This month she is even giving her mother a house, which she paid for in all cash. ''I got one of those big red bows, and I am going to stick it on the front door like in those commercials,'' she said. ''I have been wanting to do something like this for my mom since I was a little kid.''\par \par \uc2 Only two years ago Alex Lugo, 29, who lives in Lindenhurst, N.Y., drove trucks to support his wife and two children, 9 and 5. ''I was making $25 an hour,'' he said. ''That's nothing in New York.'' He decided to enroll in a program to learn how to trade in cryptocurrency, and it changed his family's life.\par \par \uc2 While some collectors buy select NFTs and hold on to them for years, he flips many in the short term. ''I ended up buying them and flipping some of them for 10K, some for 30K, some for 5K, 2K,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 He has also benefited from investing in newer types of NFTs. ''I own real estate in the Metaverse next to the Adidas headquarters,'' he said. ''It's like owning real estate in the Hamptons, because what is Adidas going to do when they want to expand? They are going to buy me out and pay me millions of dollars so I will move.''\par \par \uc2 (''This sounds speculative rather than anything that could be easily proven,'' Mr. Medved said in an email.)\par \par \uc2 Mr. Lugo made enough money from these individual sales that he quit his truck driving job in January 2021. Now, he says he has been able to tuck away a significant amount of savings for his children, who will ''have the freedom to choose what they want to do with their lives.''\par \par \uc2 He and his family currently live in a two-bedroom apartment, but he is looking to buy a four-bedroom house in Lindenhurst.\par \par \uc2 NFTs have helped others dig themselves out of financial holes and get a new start.\par \par \uc2 Gossamer Farris, 32, is now a full-time artist in Brooklyn. But it took NFTs to get her there comfortably.\par \par \uc2 After college she worked a 9 to 5 job at a student loan servicing center. ''I was doing art as much as I could after work,'' she said. ''I was making illustrations and sculptures and textile work, and I was also making items like little stickers that people could buy in my online store.''\par \par \uc2 In 2019, she quit that job to become a tattoo artist, but even that was a struggle, especially in the early months of the pandemic. ''I had a hard time making ends meet,'' she said. ''Unfortunately I had a lot of debt like credit card debt and health-related debt because I am a transgender person and had surgery.''\par \par \uc2 In the winter of 2021 she saw people were going crazy for NFTs, and she decided to try to make her own collections, with work that focuses on her Filipino and Black heritage, and collaborate with other artists on their NFTs.\par \par \uc2 She has since paid off her debt, and now makes enough money through NFTs that she can pursue her passions exclusively. ''I don't have the stress that I need to make money as an artist,'' she said. ''I can pay the rent and not have to worry about making ends meet.''\par \par \uc2 While some people are getting rich off NFTs, Mr. Medved advises people to remember that many other NFT projects lose value over time. ''You should never invest any more money than you are willing to lose,'' he said. ''The NFT space, like the crypto space, is very volatile, and the markets go up and down very quickly.''\par \par \uc2 ''I do think a lot of NFTs will end up going to zero in the long run,'' he said. ''Your success depends on your ability to pick the best projects, and that isn't easy.''\par \par \uc2 Alex Lugo, with his children Jonathan, left, and Layla. (ST8); Left, Metaverse real estate.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Biden Takes Step Toward Setting National Policy for Digital Assets\b0\par\par\uc2 By Katie Rogers and Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 1,097 \uc2 words\par \uc2 10 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 7\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The president signed an executive order that will coordinate efforts among financial regulators to better understand the risks and opportunities presented by digital assets.\par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- President Biden signed an executive order on Wednesday directing the federal government to come up with a plan to regulate cryptocurrencies, recognizing their popularity and potential to destabilize traditional finance.\par \par \uc2 The order, under development for months, will coordinate efforts among financial regulators to better understand the risks and opportunities presented by digital assets, particularly in the areas of consumer protection, national security and illicit finance.\par \par \uc2 The move, according to the Biden administration, is a response to the ''explosive growth'' in digital assets, the increasing number of countries exploring central bank digital currencies and a desire to maintain American technological leadership. It directs financial regulators to continue with work that began in earnest last year, including studying and reporting on the creation of a digital dollar.\par \par \uc2 The results could help shape the contours of a rapidly innovating industry that has swiftly moved into the mainstream but that critics say enables illicit activity, including money laundering, and creates outsize financial risks for consumers and the financial system.\par \par \uc2 Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, and Jake Sullivan, the president's national security adviser, said in a statement that the order ''will help position the U.S. to keep playing a leading role in the innovation and governance of the digital assets ecosystem at home and abroad, in a way that protects consumers, is consistent with our democratic values and advances U.S. global competitiveness.''\par \par \uc2 The directive calls on the government to assess the potential to develop a central bank digital currency -- essentially a digital dollar -- that would be used to modernize payment systems.\par \par \uc2 Central banks from the Bahamas to Sweden to China are experimenting with digital currency offerings, fueling concerns among lawmakers that the \uc2 Federal Reserve\uc2  might fall behind the competition.\par \par \uc2 In January, the Fed released a long-awaited report on central bank digital currencies, which it said was intended to generate debate. On Wednesday, after news of the executive order, the Fed's official \uc2 Twitter\uc2  account noted that it had ''made no decisions on whether to pursue or implement a central bank digital currency'' and invited the public to continue commenting on issues raised by its report.\par \par \uc2 Some, including the Fed chair, \uc2 Jerome H. Powell\uc2 , have argued that a U.S. digital dollar could eliminate the need for privately issued stablecoins -- digital currencies that promise to maintain their value by relying on stable financial backing like bank reserves and short-term debt. Private issuers resist that contention and have argued that they can coexist with a central digital currency, should one be developed.\par \par \uc2 Administration officials, who detailed the digital currency portion of the order for reporters on Wednesday, said the Fed's earlier report provided a strong foundation but did not attempt to resolve some of the trickier issues surrounding a digital dollar, including its design and issuance.\par \par \uc2 Treasury Department officials will now embark on a much more extensive examination of the digital dollar concept and the problems that could arise from it.\par \par \uc2 Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at \uc2 Cornell University\uc2  and the author of a book called ''The Future of Money,'' said the order would put the United States in ''pole position'' to set global standards and move closer to what he said was ''the inevitable digitization of the world's pre-eminent currency.''\par \par \uc2 Experts on cryptocurrencies have long called for the government to streamline what had been a scattershot regulatory approach.\par \par \uc2 ''We need clear answers on how to do things,'' said Louis Lehot, a cryptocurrency expert at the law firm \uc2 Foley & Lardner\uc2 . ''We're operating in a gray zone and in a sandbox.''\par \par \uc2 He added, ''We've seen a complete lack of any strategic direction or thought from the federal government for years.''\par \par \uc2 The order comes at a moment of heightened national security concerns, including whether Russia will use cryptocurrency to evade punishing sanctions that the United States has imposed on President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2 's regime as a result of his invasion of Ukraine. A senior Biden administration official who detailed the contents of the executive order but was not authorized to speak about it publicly told reporters on Tuesday evening that work on it had predated the Ukraine war.\par \par \uc2 Cryptocurrency would not be a viable way for Russia to circumvent sanctions, the official said, but the geopolitical situation exacerbates longstanding concerns about the role of anonymity in cryptocurrency and the risk of illicit activity that results. The \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology underlying cryptocurrencies gives anyone who can read computer code the ability to track transactions, ostensibly eliminating the need for trust between transacting parties and allowing for anonymity.\par \par \uc2 Names and personal identifying information are not always required to participate in the crypto economy: On many decentralized platforms, programs and apps, code runs the show. The industry's offerings are attracting ever more money to projects that defy traditional business definitions, and increasingly vast amounts of digital assets are being managed by major players -- including venture capitalists and developers -- who operate without sharing their names.\par \par \uc2 Regulators have yet to write many rules surrounding the new technology, but Mr. Biden's executive order could change that.\par \par \uc2 Anticipation of a regulatory crackdown, along with rules requiring tougher scrutiny of digital transactions that were tucked into Mr. Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure bill, has prompted the cryptocurrency industry to beef up its lobbying presence in Washington.\par \par \uc2 Some groups promoting digital assets welcomed the order. ''The fact that the U.S. president has something to say about crypto is meaningful,'' said Kristin Smith, the executive director of the \uc2 Blockchain\uc2  Association, an industry trade group.\par \par \uc2 Senator \uc2 Patrick J. Toomey\uc2 , Republican of Pennsylvania and a cryptocurrency champion, directed unusual praise toward the White House for highlighting the potential benefits of cryptocurrencies, including stablecoins. But he warned that regulatory overreach could stymie growth in an area where innovation has been led by consumers.\par \par \uc2 ''This technology empowers individuals, and they deserve to have a say in crafting thoughtful legislation,'' Mr. Toomey said in a statement. ''The administration should resist the urge to stretch existing laws in an effort to expand its regulatory authority.''\par \par \uc2 David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 The move by the Biden administration is a response to what it called the ''explosive growth'' in digital assets.

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Cracks in the Pillars Of a Crypto Utopia\b0\par\par\uc2 By Eric Lipton and Ephrat Livni \par \uc2 1,971 \uc2 words\par \uc2 9 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 WASHINGTON -- American CryptoFed is a new kind of company spawned by the advent of cryptocurrency -- one that claims, in a way, not to be a company at all.\par \par \uc2 There are no owners, officers or employees, according to its stated plan. Instead, American CryptoFed is a ''decentralized autonomous organization'' that is supposed to be steered automatically by computer code and governed by a community of users who vote on proposals with crypto tokens.\par \par \uc2 To their proponents, these types of ventures, known as DAOs, are a new model for commerce, one that could democratize business enterprises and break the hold that Big Tech and other entrenched middlemen have over innovation in the information age. Already, a rapidly growing number of these upstart organizations have emerged online, including financial services operations, news hubs and social clubs.\par \par \uc2 But they are also coming under fire from multiple angles, reflecting both the disruptive force of the crypto phenomenon and the struggle to prove its practical use beyond financial speculation.\par \par \uc2 Members of DAOs are clashing with one another about how to balance the need for skilled and experienced managers against the idealistic vision of communal decision-making. In some cases, crypto investors and regulators say, the ventures amount to Ponzi schemes intended to do little more than bolster the value of the digital tokens they sell.\par \par \uc2 And regulators are swooping in amid concern about how to protect investors in organizations that do not adopt traditional business and accounting practices.\par \par \uc2 Just four months after the launch of American CryptoFed DAO, which planned to create a crypto payments system, the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2  in November effectively shut it down, saying the enterprise was ''materially misleading'' the public with contradictory filings that failed to disclose key information such as audited financial statements.\par \par \uc2 Hester M. Peirce, a commissioner on the \uc2 Securities and Exchange Commission\uc2 , called the surge in DAO activity somewhat overwhelming.\par \par \uc2 ''The last year or so has been a big period for DAOs, and people are doing a lot of experimentation,'' Ms. Peirce said. ''Just trying to even grapple with what this actually means is hard because everything's moving so fast.''\par \par \uc2 Many DAOs are wrestling with challenges, including huge financial losses from software flaws and hacks, internal divisions that threaten some entities' continued existence and allegations of improper diversion of community funds. Others have struggled with low turnout among members when it comes to voting on a strategy or business decision, effectively leaving control in the hands of the investors who put up money to help start them.\par \par \uc2 This messy gestation has fueled a debate: Are these ventures simply vehicles to enrich insiders and exploit consumers, or early experiments in a new way of doing business?\par \par \uc2 The value of cryptocurrencies held in more than 4,000 different DAO treasuries rose 3,200 percent in 2021, hitting more than $13 billion by December, according to a tracking website called DeepDAO, although the figures fluctuate considerably with swings in crypto values.\par \par \uc2 DAOs already run a wide array of projects, including decentralized financial services like Compound and SushiSwap; investment pools like Red DAO, where fashion enthusiasts join to buy digital collectibles; and social clubs like Friends with Benefits, whose token holders gather virtually and in person.\par \par \uc2 The concept has been embraced by individual crypto investors and some of the biggest industry players alike, including the Silicon Valley venture capital firm \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , which has billions of dollars backing \uc2 blockchain\uc2  projects. And industry lobbyists and lawyers, including from Andreessen and American CryptoFed, are already working in Washington and state capitals, pushing for recognition of DAOs and updates to what they call ''antiquated'' laws.\par \par \uc2 For now, federal regulators have little clear legal authority to oversee these entities, unless a DAO appears to be violating securities laws. Ms. Peirce at the S.E.C. said the result was a recipe for confusion and constant conflict as regulators struggle to police the new entities.\par \par \uc2 Perhaps the most promising and fraught aspect of DAOs is their approach to making business decisions.\par \par \uc2 Although DAOs may select leadership groups or hire staff, the major decision-making power is theoretically left to the members, ensuring in theory that choices serve the majority of participants.\par \par \uc2 ''The virtual world in your hands'' is the slogan at Decentraland, a virtual game space that, like most DAOs, relies on online voting forums to make decisions. Players can use tokens to buy ''land'' or costumes, and hang out as avatars at virtual social events.\par \par \uc2 Eyal Eithcowich, the founder of the tracking website DeepDAO, cited Decentraland and DXDAO as examples of DAOs that appear to be living up to the ideal. Decentraland alone has had more than 1,000 different referendums on topics such as ''Should wearables including guns be allowed?''\par \par \uc2 ''You have had internet forums before where there are debates and you can feel part of a community,'' Mr. Eithcowich said. ''But here, you don't just get a sense of ownership. You actually do own part of the platform, and your votes have a direct effect on it. That is the beauty of it to me.''\par \par \uc2 Major corporate players are also getting involved, like \uc2 JPMorgan Chase\uc2 , which opened an outpost in Decentraland, a ''lounge'' to promote its Onyx payment network that includes a digital portrait of its chief executive, \uc2 Jamie Dimon\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 But the reality of setting up and running these DAOs has often been complicated.\par \par \uc2 OlympusDAO, born a year ago, drew international attention and skepticism for boasting extraordinarily high rates of return to crypto holders who commit tokens to the system for a specific time. At one point it offered an annual yield of up to nearly 8,000 percent.\par \par \uc2 The platform holds regular online votes on proposals like one in January weighing an alliance with JonesDAO, a start-up that allows users to invest in higher-risk crypto derivatives and futures.\par \par \uc2 But \uc2 Olympus\uc2  is largely controlled by its pseudonymous founder, Zeus, whose statements about the business model have baffled industry insiders. The result has been to leave even crypto enthusiasts musing publicly that the operation is probably a Ponzi scheme entirely reliant on participants' continual faith and inflows of crypto to stay afloat.\par \par \uc2 Without the traditional disclosures required from a public company or even a private one raising public funds, little is known about OlympusDAO, said Jordi Alexander, an executive at the digital asset trading firm Selini Capital.\par \par \uc2 ''No one is ultimately auditing it to make sure that the statements are true,'' Mr. Alexander said from his base in Singapore, elaborating on a Medium post he wrote raising questions about \uc2 Olympus\uc2 's strategy.\par \par \uc2 Having reached a high of about $1,400, an \uc2 Olympus\uc2  token is now worth only about $30, a loss of nearly $4 billion in value.\par \par \uc2 An individual representing himself as Zeus defended the project in an interview, saying, ''I just always tried to act authentically and honestly.'' Said Isfandiyar Shaheen, an \uc2 Olympus\uc2  community leader, added in a statement that the platform does conduct audits of its code and routinely discloses financial data live on its online platform, meaning it is ''in reality more transparent than most public and private companies.''\par \par \uc2 Community strife has also prompted a price crash at Wonderland DAO, whose founder was recently forced to disclose that the platform's treasurer, known as Sifu, was a man going by the name Michael Patryn. Mr. Patryn was previously convicted of financial crimes in the United States and Canada and was a co-founder of the failed Canadian cryptocurrency exchange \uc2 QuadrigaCX\uc2 , whose other founder's mysterious death has left law enforcement suspicious and customers out about $135 million in crypto.\par \par \uc2 Among the topics debated since then on the Wonderland governance forum are whether the DAO should dissolve, or transform into something more like a classic corporation by hiring ''a team of professionals that have background checks,'' including chief financial, legal and operating officers.\par \par \uc2 The problems that have emerged often stem from the anonymous nature of DAOs and cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 This anonymity can undermine accountability and facilitate what critics call abuses of power, like at SushiSwap, where its creator, who goes by Chef Nomi, left the project abruptly, cashing out on nearly $13 million worth of tokens amid infighting.\par \par \uc2 A developer who goes by OxMaki and who was involved in starting SushiSwap told \uc2 The New York Times\uc2  in a Telegram chat that the DAO's strengths -- diversity and decentralization -- also turned out to be weaknesses.\par \par \uc2 ''It was formed from a wild spectrum of people worldwide without relation between all the parties. The vision and direction being different for each group. It was never fully decided internally. Which was a mistake,'' he wrote, adding that he never met other Sushi team members in person. (OxMaki, who called himself an ''anarcho-capitalist,'' declined to disclose his real name.)\par \par \uc2 American CryptoFed calls itself the first legally sanctioned DAO in the United States. It was registered in Wyoming, which passed the first state law formally recognizing DAOs and exempting crypto tokens from state securities laws.\par \par \uc2 In September, it notified the S.E.C. that it would create two new cryptocurrencies for payments and governance in its internal economy, both of which would first be distributed to the public and then later bought, sold and traded.\par \par \uc2 But the S.E.C. in November quickly moved to block the issuance, asserting in a complaint that this was an illegal securities offering, a move that the DAO is now fighting.\par \par \uc2 Fearing S.E.C. enforcement, start-ups aiming for decentralization have increasingly turned to private equity funds for capital, giving big investors a large chunk of tokens. Venture capitalists like \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , as a result, have ended up in some cases playing a disproportionate role in decision-making.\par \par \uc2 Venture funds, founders, core team members and other insiders controlled nearly 50 percent of the Solana platform's token, SOL, upon its initial release, giving them a large governance stake in the DAO, said Ryan Watkins, a crypto industry analyst.\par \par \uc2 This insider problem is exacerbated by the often low voter turnouts of individual token holders, making it easy for big players to influence outcomes.\par \par \uc2 ''The more concentrated the token supply is, the more problematic it will be,'' said Mr. Watkins, who recently left the crypto data firm Messari, which tracks these trends. ''It raises the question: Is this really a DAO, or is it just like some rich guys deciding what to do?''\par \par \uc2 Some DAOs are realizing that running a truly decentralized entity can be hard and are moving to form leadership committees that oversee certain key operations, again resembling a more traditional corporate structure, Mr. Watkins said.\par \par \uc2 But that, too, can be a fraught process. Last summer, the DAO for Uniswap, a decentralized crypto exchange, voted to form and back a lobbying group, the DeFi Education Fund, yet struggled when the new group moved much faster than promised to sell off millions of dollars' worth of tokens, provoking a community backlash.\par \par \uc2 Insiders with large stakes, like the Uniswap investor \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2 , pushed the proposal, said Chris Blec, the founder of DeFi Watch, a crypto news site promoting transparency.\par \par \uc2 ''Basically, they proposed and voted through this thing that ended up being like a legal slush fund for them,'' he said. ''The whole thing is intended to further their corporate interests.''\par \par \uc2 Miles Jennings, a lawyer at \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  leading its drive for formal federal recognition of DAOs, said concerns about insider control were legitimate.\par \par \uc2 ''Healthy skepticism is warranted,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''We're still in a very early stage.''\par \par \uc2 Ventures based in the digital world, he added, are connected to the real world. ''And laws and regulations,'' he said, ''are going to need to apply.''\par \par \uc2 David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 David Yaffe-Bellany contributed reporting.\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPH BY Scott Gelber FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220309ei390003v\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 Business/Financial Desk; SECTB\par \b \uc2 Advertising Acts as Vehicle of Protest to Invasion\b0\par\par\uc2 By Tiffany Hsu \par \uc2 1,517 \uc2 words\par \uc2 7 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 3\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Criticism of Russia has become a common feature of advertisements and the marketing industry.\par \par \uc2 As western social media sites tried to block misleading ads coming out of Russia this week, Rob Blackie was trying to sneak ads in.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Blackie, a British digital strategist, wanted Russians to see impartial news about the invasion in Ukraine. His solution to avoid Russia's censors: digital ads, which he and a team of volunteers began buying with automated technology and slipping past government filters onto online platforms in Russia.\par \par \uc2 Bearing neutral headlines such as, ''What is known about the situation in Ukraine at the moment,'' the ads were viewed two million times as of midday Friday and directed viewers 42,000 times to independent news sources such as the \uc2 BBC\uc2 , Mr. Blackie said.\par \par \uc2 ''The great thing about digital advertising is that it's quite hard to stop it,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Pushback against the Russian assault has played out prominently in the form of economic sanctions, company exits and widespread moral outrage. But as President \uc2 Vladimir V. Putin\uc2  continues his advance into Ukraine, advertising has become another vehicle of protest: in commercials squeezed in the margins of news coverage, in subtle tweaks to brand names and marketing campaigns, in agencies leaving Russia and in attempts to counteract the misinformation splashed across online banners with more accurate messaging.\par \par \uc2 Marla Kaplowitz\uc2 , the chief executive of 4A's, an advertising trade group, said the industry has done far more to respond to Russia's attack compared with past crises. Marketing organizations have galvanized around addressing misinformation, with a 100-person conference call on the situation on Thursday and another meeting on Friday, she said.\par \par \uc2 ''We see the industry trying to figure out what to do, because people feel a bit helpless, like putting out a statement just doesn't feel like enough right now,'' she said. ''The whole world is reacting in a different way, rallying around Ukraine -- it's not enough to just say something, you actually have to do something.''\par \par \uc2 Almost immediately after Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24, brands began producing symbolic expressions of solidarity. E-sports teams, productivity apps, health care companies, crypto services, ad giants and other organizations changed their logos to reflect the blue and yellow of the Ukrainian flag.\par \par \uc2 The \uc2 Ad Council\uc2 , a nonprofit known for its public service campaigns featuring Smokey Bear and McGruff the Crime Dog, began running a campaign online and on billboards on Thursday directing viewers to donate to the Ukraine Crisis Relief Fund. The British price comparison website Compare the Market removed ads featuring its popular 13-year-old mascot, an animated meerkat portrayed as a Russian oligarch named Aleksandr Orlov.\par \par \uc2 Wargaming, an online game developer based in Cyprus, stripped its advertising of images of tanks and combat vehicles and focused instead on in-game narratives.\par \par \uc2 Ads also became a front in the information war, as efforts to share verified news and solicit help clashed with Russia's push to spread falsehoods and censor independent reports.\par \par \uc2 Twitter\uc2  temporarily paused ads in Ukraine and Russia so that the ads did not distract from public safety information. \uc2 Facebook\uc2 's parent company Meta said it was blocking Russian state media from advertising or monetizing on its platform. \uc2 Google\uc2  suspended advertising from Russian state media on \uc2 YouTube\uc2 ; \uc2 Snap\uc2  halted ad sales in Russia and its ally, Belarus.\par \par \uc2 On Friday, Russia blocked \uc2 Facebook\uc2  inside the country, as part of the Kremlin's broadening campaign to tighten control of the internet and limit spaces for dissent about the war in Ukraine. The move could foreshadow further restrictions against other tech companies such as \uc2 Google\uc2 , which owns \uc2 YouTube\uc2 , and \uc2 Twitter\uc2 . \uc2 Facebook\uc2  said it would pause ad targeting capabilities in Russia and prevent advertisers in the country from running ads on the platform.\par \par \uc2 Before those restrictions, one digital ad agency tried to rally advertising professionals to participate in ''the most important brief ever,'' with the goal of stopping a potential world war. Through its Prevent WW3 project, ISD Group solicited marketing campaigns that would raise money for Ukrainian refugees, encourage peacekeepers to protect Ukraine, inform Russians about the war and persuade companies to leave Russia.\par \par \uc2 Examples so far have included small efforts such as posters and digital ads, but also complex initiatives such as one from a creative director in San Francisco who is trying to persuade American bars and restaurants to expand their menus with Molotov cocktails -- drinks accompanied by stories about the Ukrainian bartenders who submitted recipes.\par \par \uc2 The ad agency DDB Germany was working on a broader campaign about press censorship called ''Truth Wins'' when its client, the nonprofit group \uc2 Reporters Without Borders\uc2 , asked it to quickly craft a response to Russian efforts to stanch information flow about Ukraine. The agency came up with a plan to collect censored articles about the war and mint them into the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  via Ethereum domain links, preventing them from being blocked by the Russian government.\par \par \uc2 But Madison Avenue was also skittish in some ways. Companies faced conflicting advice to pause marketing campaigns out of respect for Ukraine, but also to speak out in support of the country. Executives were pressured to pause their advertising campaigns and instead gift their marketing budgets to humanitarian aid organizations (though warnings circulated on social media about scammers pretending to collect donations for relief efforts).\par \par \uc2 Wall-to-wall news coverage showing the smoking rubble of residential buildings and newborn infants in intensive care in a makeshift bomb shelter caused familiar fears to resurface for companies that had worried during the pandemic about how their advertising would be perceived alongside tragic news events.\par \par \uc2 Within a week of Russia's first attack, several ads had faced criticism, including an Applebee's ad that appeared amid a CNN broadcast about air raid sirens in Kyiv.\par \par \uc2 Kylie Jenner, the ''Keeping Up With the Kardashians'' star and beauty brand executive, faced accusations of being ''tone deaf'' when she posted an \uc2 Instagram\uc2  Story offering her ''thoughts and prayers'' to Ukrainians and followed it two hours later with a post promoting a lip shine product.\par \par \uc2 The Aggregator Show, an event in New Jersey geared to \uc2 Amazon\uc2  vendors, said it fired a worker who advertised the gathering by writing in a \uc2 LinkedIn\uc2  post that ''while Russia is taking over Ukraine, we're taking over the \uc2 Amazon\uc2  event industry.'' The post ended with a taunt: ''Whoever can't handle it, take shelter.''\par \par \uc2 ''This is not who we are or what we are about,'' the company said in a statement about the post.\par \par \uc2 Afraid of stumbling into a similar scenario, some companies have begun blocking their ads from appearing next to news coverage about the crisis in Ukraine, brand safety specialists said. The precautions echo a rush in 2020 to avoid stories featuring words such as ''coronavirus'' and ''pandemic,'' although concerns about depriving publishers of critical advertising revenue has pushed many companies to evolve their blocking strategies.\par \par \uc2 ''To put things into perspective, this is a real crisis situation that's life or death for many people,'' said Jason Lee, the senior vice president of digital and data strategy for Horizon Media. ''What we're doing in the advertising and media world is very important, but we also have to be mindful of this larger conflict occurring, and so it gets back to the question: Could a brand be part of the conversation, and should they?''\par \par \uc2 While advertising clients weighed their options, the agencies and industry organizations representing them offered support to their Ukrainian counterparts and shunned Russia. \uc2 Accenture\uc2 , which has a large marketing business, pulled out of Russia on Thursday. Organizers of Cannes Lions, the industry conference and competition scheduled for the summer in France, said on Friday that they would not accept submissions or delegations from Russia and would offer free passes to Ukrainian participants. \uc2 Etsy\uc2 , the online marketplace, said it was waiving advertising charges, along with other fees, for its sellers in Ukraine.\par \par \uc2 But the two countries have a relatively small presence in the Western advertising world. \uc2 Mark Read\uc2 , the chief executive of the ad giant \uc2 WPP\uc2 , said during a conference call with investors on Feb. 24 that while Russia's aggression toward Ukraine was ''obviously a great concern to us,'' the countries' ''economic impact on our business is not necessarily that great.''\par \par \uc2 On Friday, \uc2 WPP\uc2  discontinued its operations in Russia, where it has nearly 1,400 employees but draws less than 1 percent of its annual revenue. In a statement, it said that having an ongoing presence in a country responsible for the ''horrific attack'' on Ukraine ''would be inconsistent with our values as a company.''\par \par \uc2 Almost immediately after Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24, many brands and organizations changed their logos to images of the Ukrainian flag, above, and some donated their marketing budgets to humanitarian relief groups.

The answer is hardly anything. Notwithstanding the rhetoric, only the smallest proportion of artists are actually making money on NFTs.\par \par \uc2 I asked the economist Ethan McMahon of the analytics firm \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2  to crunch some numbers, and they showed that about half of all NFTs that sell go for less that $400 -- hardly enough to cover the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  costs when a creator ''mints'' an NFT, let alone the costs of maintaining a digital studio. (And that's not counting the untold number of NFTs that don't sell at all.)\par \par \uc2 McMahon also said that almost all the resale action for NFTs, where the real money gets made, happens at the top end of the market; the vast majority of NFTs barely get resold. ''People who are trying to profiteer off whatever crazed hype there is around this NFT space really need to be careful,'' McMahon said. ''Because a lot of times it ends up being to your disadvantage.''\par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220306ei360006s\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

Hardly.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Blake Gopnik \par \uc2 2,724 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 20\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Around 1425, the Florentine artist Masaccio painted the first major works in one-point perspective. That revolutionized what artists could do ever after.\par \par \uc2 In Paris in 1839, Louis-Jacques-Mand\u233\'00\'E9 Daguerre demonstrated his new photographic invention. It changed the nature of visual representation and museum walls haven't been the same since.\par \par \uc2 On March 11, 2021, all of one year ago, Mike Winkelmann, whose nom d'artiste is Beeple, sold a collage of computer illustrations for $69 million simply because that collage came attached to a digital certificate called an NFT. That colossal price launched a mad scramble among creators of all kinds -- illustrators, musicians, photographers, even a few veteran avant-gardists -- to join the NFT gold rush.\par \par \uc2 In the 12 months since, something like $44 billion has been spent on about six million NFTs, usually issued to certify digital creations but sometimes for physical objects like paintings and sculptures.\par \par \uc2 But did this vast tsunami of ''NFT art'' actually trigger any kind of sea change in what art looks like, what it means or what, in some profound sense, it is? Hardly at all, and there's a chance such a change might barely be possible: That's because ''NFT art'' simply does not exist.\par \par \uc2 An NFT -- a nonfungible token -- is nothing more than a certificate of ownership and authenticity that can be attached to any kind of object, even a sneaker or newspaper article, and that can't be changed or lost because it lives on a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Imagine an NFT as being the deed to a house: It tells you who owns it and maybe a few things about it, but you would never talk about a ''deeded house'' as though that were somehow different from a plain-old-fashioned house. Ditto for ''NFT art'' vs. plain-old-fashioned ''art.''\par \par \uc2 Typically, the art object that gets NFT'd is a digital file -- maybe a JPEG image or an MP4 video -- that lives on some hard drive, and that looks or sounds precisely the way it would have in the decades before NFTs came along. Even the least traditional works that come with an NFT ''certificate,'' like the autobiographical animations of the transgender teenager known as Fewocious, would be just as good or bad, depending on your tastes, if they had never been ''certified'' with the NFT.\par \par \uc2 Beeple himself is trading the digital for the physical in his first gallery show at Jack Hanley in New York: He's showing prints, drawings and paintings -- as though there had never been anything inherently NFT-ish in his work from the start. (The objects at Hanley will also be NFT'd, for sale, on the \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 If a hacker managed to destroy every NFT, 99.9 percent of the creations those NFTs ''certified'' would remain unchanged. (We'll get to the remaining .1 percent in a bit, because that's the fun and vital part of this story: the very few NFTs that may lead to new art.)\par \par \uc2 ''I would wholeheartedly underwrite the statement that there is no NFT art \u173\'00\'AD\u173\'00\'AD-- that there is art, or there is digital art,'' said Rudolf Frieling, media-arts curator at the \uc2 San Francisco Museum of Modern Art\uc2 , which has been a pioneer in collecting digital art of all kinds, from websites to 3-D-printed sculptures. ''The idea that you could have an 'NFT art show' is, to my mind, frankly, ridiculous,'' Frieling said.\par \par \uc2 Michael Bouhanna, a specialist at \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  auction house in London, has been selling digital art works with NFT ''deeds'' for longer than almost anyone. He thinks that before too long, as the novelty of NFTs wears off, people will just talk about ''digital art'' and leave the NFT off to one side, as a detail in the transfer of ownership.\par \par \uc2 Sales, rather than aesthetics, were the reason NFTs were created. In 2014, the veteran digital artist Kevin McCoy was working into the wee hours at a tech-friendly art-a-thon at the New Museum in New York, when he and a technologist named Anil Dash created what is widely seen as the first NFT. (Though it didn't have that name yet.)\par \par \uc2 The other week, I went to a nicely renovated house in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, to meet with McCoy, 55, and his wife, Jennifer, 53, who have been partners in life and art since 1990. McCoy explained that, back in 2014, he was looking for a way to assert authorship, and to transfer ownership, of the digital creations that he and his friends made and mostly failed to sell. After all, a digital file, whether a video or a JPEG like the ones made by Beeple, can be endlessly and perfectly copied -- and maybe should be, if artists want their ideas to have the widest impact.\par \par \uc2 What was needed was a way to make a few of those copies ''authentic,'' different enough from all other copies. McCoy realized that blockchains could function as a kind of virtual vault. Put the deed to a digital artwork in that vault, as an NFT, and a collector suddenly has something fixed that can be owned and traded.\par \par \uc2 The McCoys said that by giving digital artists a way to sell art objects with some of the ease that painters and sculptors have always had, the new token Kevin designed would help them, and their art, survive and thrive. ''You could actually feel like you had free space to think,'' Jennifer said.\par \par \uc2 Eight years later, the idea has finally paid off for the McCoys. That first NFT that Kevin created, which he'd attached to a modest digital abstraction titled ''Quantum,'' sold last June at \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  for $1.4 million.\par \par \uc2 Amid the Hype, No One's Making Money\par \par \uc2 But NFTs aren't doing as much for most artists. I asked the economist Ethan McMahon of the analytics firm \uc2 Chainalysis\uc2  to crunch some numbers, and they showed that about half of all NFTs that sell go for less that $400 -- hardly enough to cover the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  costs when a creator ''mints'' an NFT, let alone the costs of maintaining a digital studio. (And that's not counting the untold number of NFTs that don't sell at all.)\par \par \uc2 McMahon also said that almost all the resale action for NFTs, where the real money gets made, happens at the top end of the market; the vast majority of NFTs barely get resold. ''People who are trying to profiteer off whatever crazed hype there is around this NFT space really need to be careful,'' McMahon said. ''Because a lot of times it ends up being to your disadvantage.''\par \par \uc2 NFTs and the Crowds They Bring\par \par \uc2 Rather than looking to NFTs for a bigger payday, some technophilic artists might be satisfied if those tokens brought a bigger and more attentive audience. The NFT craze has attracted a community of digital natives with even closer ties than the ones that bind collectors in the art market. These eager NFT newbies might just have the potential to create ''a revolution of support for digital creatives,'' said John Gerrard, a 48-year-old Irishman whose digital art won him wide recognition before NFTs existed. In 2014, on the plaza of Lincoln Center in New York, a giant LED screen displayed a dazzlingly realistic ''live'' image of a solar-power plant in Nevada, entirely constructed from the zeros and ones of Gerrard's computer.\par \par \uc2 And yet for all his success Gerrard feels that the art world has mostly turned its back on digital work like his, in favor of the paintings that dominate an ever more conservative and analog scene. The popularity of NFTs might lead to something like a new gallery neighborhood, the equivalent of Chelsea or TriBeCa in New York -- except that it would be virtual, a marketplace for the most fascinating of digital files instead of brilliant objects.\par \par \uc2 But Gerrard may be misunderstanding what the world of NFTs is really about. Just as no one collects a 1916 Babe Ruth card to contemplate the portrait on it, or the ''Inverted Jenny'' stamp to enjoy the biplane it bears, so the vast majority of the NFT'd files that get bid into the stratosphere are collected for their collectability alone. The artistic brilliance is pretty much beside the point.\par \par \uc2 It's not hard to imagine an \uc2 eBay\uc2  community all about buying old deeds to homes: ''Look, I've got a Frank Lloyd Wright!''; ''Hey, my mint Eames is way rarer.'' To an amazing degree, collecting NFTs is pretty much the same. It fulfills quite different human needs and drives than those of fine art.\par \par \uc2 Yet those needs -- for community, for ownership and its power, for social validation -- reveal the truly artistic potential of NFTs.\par \par \uc2 NFTs as Artistic Inspiration\par \par \uc2 ''Art exists in a world where one is always making political choices about one's relationship to economics,'' said Amy Whitaker, who teaches art-world economics at \uc2 New York University\uc2 . The way NFTs have been bought, sold and admired automatically raises issues of ownership and its meaning. Issues of generosity (in that NFT'd images are supposed to circulate freely) and greed (in that they are mostly bought to make the cryptorich richer). And issues of community in the making of NFTs, which can be a group act, and of individualism, often, in who gets the money for any one creation. With NFTs, Whitaker said, such social ''incidentals'' take center stage, whereas it's just about possible to see a work of conventional fine art in glorious aesthetic isolation.\par \par \uc2 But those links to social and economic factors have in fact been central to the fine art of the last few decades at its most novel and challenging. Take the genre known as ''Business Art,'' where the act of buying and selling, in all its cultural complexity, has been turned into the work itself. The genre was pioneered some 60 years ago in projects by Yves Klein, Andy Warhol and various 1960s conceptualists, and then took off in the 1990s in work by Damien Hirst.\par \par \uc2 Last summer, when Hirst moved into NFTs -- one of the first art stars to do so -- he called his project ''The Currency'': He offered NFTs that corresponded to 10,000 of his Spot paintings; one year after a purchase, a collector would be given the choice between keeping the \uc2 blockchain\uc2  token and watching the corresponding canvas burn, or keeping the canvas and giving up the NFT. Hirst, the Business Artist, was staging a fight between market forces and aesthetic delight. Produced with HENI, an art services business, the project grossed about $18 million from the initial sale.\par \par \uc2 NFTs by the digital native known as Pak can also be placed in the Business Art tradition: He has offered digital images with the barest visual interest -- riffs on a minimal cube such as any designer could make -- but which get lots of impact from the bizarre way in which they are sold as NFTs. They are offered to the public for just minutes at a time, and the total number you buy affects the kind of NFT'd image you get. If we're looking for true ''NFT art,'' where the NFT-ness itself is at issue, then Pak's digital Business Art qualifies.\par \par \uc2 And then there's the even more slippery genre known as ''relational art,'' whose goal is to cast light on human interactions by triggering new ones. Back in 1992, the Thai artist Rirkrit Tiravanija crafted the classic example: He began to cook and serve curry to museumgoers, not for the sake of gastronomy -- he started out as a pretty weak chef -- but to put a spotlight on what it means to make such an offer.\par \par \uc2 Where Tiravanija experimented with food and generosity, CryptoPunks, some of the earliest of all art NFTs, can be thought of as an experiment that puts a spotlight on the act of collecting, and what it means.\par \par \uc2 CryptoPunks were born in June 2017, when the programmers Matt Hall and John Watkinson used some basic code to generate 10,000 cartoonish pictures of different human heads, so pixelated that you can only just make out a few identifying features -- a purple hat on one, red hair on another. They were free for the asking when first NFT'd, but because of their variety, and their limited supply, they became some of the most collectible of collectibles, and can now trade for millions of dollars each.\par \par \uc2 In late February, \uc2 Sotheby's\uc2  was about to sell a single lot of 104 CryptoPunk NFTs for as much as $30 million, when the collector who consigned them pulled out at the last minute. ''People were extremely upset,'' said Kent Charugundla, an NFT collector who was at the canceled auction. The problem, he explained, was that the surging market for the collectibles might begin to sputter.\par \par \uc2 That explanation shows how even when the new art puts NFT-ness on the table, in all its social and economic complexity, it can't escape the rapacious capitalism that has come to be at its heart. Speaking over Zoom from Buffalo, Tina Rivers Ryan, a curator at the Albright-Knox museum who showed early interest in NFTs, said that if digital artists see NFTs as promising a rich future for their neglected medium, the new world of tokens may instead bring about ''an impoverishment -- and not just of digital art, but of art full stop, because it reduces art to being a frictionless commodity.''\par \par \uc2 But Ryan pointed me to one remote corner of the NFT universe where work is going on that pushes back against business as usual. A year ago, just as NFTs were exploding into view, Kelani Nichole, the founder of Transfer, the bricks-and-mortar gallery in Brooklyn devoted to all kinds of computer art, helped organize an online NFT exhibition called ''Pieces of Me.'' A mission statement declared that the show was meant to ''reflect on NFTs through a curatorial and technological framework that emphasizes the ethics of care, redistribution of wealth, and artist's agency and rights.''\par \par \uc2 Some artists offer their works free (''an explicit rejection of the capitalist urge to consume''), while others offer works that come with conditions not exactly standard in the NFT world. A piece by the Londoner Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley, for instance, consists of a low-fi GIF that presents a series of written out ''Terms and Conditions,'' committing the buyer to ''showcase and invest in the works of Black trans artists'' -- and then in the NFT's binding contract the collector agrees to abide by those commitments, printing them out and pasting them up for two years.\par \par \uc2 The buyer of the NFT for Kim Laughton's ''Ascetic'' acquires a work that is anything but: They get ownership of an actual chain, golden and bejeweled, with the title word spelled out, as well as a digital image of the piece meant for sharing. The project captures contradictions in the NFT world between its claims for a transcendent new immateriality and the very earthbound bling involved in almost all its transactions.\par \par \uc2 As art objects, not all the pieces in ''Pieces'' have much new to say to a critic, and they certainly didn't need NFTs to not say it. Taken together, however, they turn the show into a work of ''meta-art'' -- of meta-relational-art -- that reflects on what it means to be an artist, a curator, or a collector in our post-Beeple world.\par \par \uc2 Top, Kevin and Jennifer McCoy with ''Quantum Leap,'' a recent digital image offered for sale as an NFT, projected on them in their home studio in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

\par\par \uc2 Money and Business/Financial Desk; SECTBU\par \b \uc2 No Prying. No Belly Pats. Just Work.\b0\par\par\uc2 By Sarah Kessler \par \uc2 2,091 \uc2 words\par \uc2 6 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 1\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 For the past nine months, I have been pregnant. But I have not -- for the most part -- been pregnant at work.\par \par \uc2 In the beginning, when I felt nauseous, I threw up in my own bathroom. Saltine crackers became a constant companion but remained out of view of my Zoom camera. A couple of months later, I switched from jeans to leggings without any comment from my co-workers.\par \par \uc2 And as my baby grew from the size of a lemon to a grapefruit to a cantaloupe, the box through which my colleagues see me on video calls cropped out my basketball-sized gut.\par \par \uc2 Outside the virtual office, an airport security screener scolded me for trying to pick up a suitcase, cashiers became extra nice and strangers informed me of how big or small or wide or high my belly was.\par \par \uc2 But when I logged on to work remotely each morning, all mentions of my ballooning body and imminent life change abruptly stopped. Instead, I focused on, talked about and was asked about work.\par \par \uc2 I didn't intentionally hide my pregnancy from a majority of my colleagues. It just didn't often come up. Which, I imagine, is how things often work for expectant fathers.\par \par \uc2 For parents-to-be whose bodies don't broadcast the pregnancy, it's possible to share news of an arriving child with close colleagues but omit it at client meetings.\par \par \uc2 They can inform their bosses about their intentions to take parental leave months before telling co-workers who won't be affected by their absence; they can casually mention at the end of happy hour that their baby is due in a week or give a presentation to a large group without first disclosing that they've chosen to expand their family. My husband told the team he manages that he would be taking parental leave at a weekly meeting during my second trimester.\par \par \uc2 If you're the one who is pregnant, at a certain point you don't have those options.\par \par \uc2 But that's not the case with remote workers, a category that expanded to include more than 42 percent of employed Americans during the early days of the pandemic, according to the \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Many pregnant women cannot work remotely, and those who do tend to feel lucky. Not going into a physical office means getting to skip a lot of awkward small talk (''So, will you be breastfeeding?'') and unexpected belly rubs.\par \par \uc2 It also means a chance to avoid a certain kind of seemingly well-intentioned but unwanted help from colleagues -- like preemptively lightened workloads -- that can make women feel suddenly less capable. This behavior is known as ''benevolent sexism'' in academic literature.\par \par \uc2 There isn't a lot of incentive to awkwardly insert a pregnancy announcement into a work conference call: Passing pregnant women over for raises and promotions, or pushing them out of their jobs entirely, is both illegal and commonplace.\par \par \uc2 And research suggests that pregnant women tend to be seen as less competent, more needing of accommodation, and less committed to work as compared with women who don't have children, said Eden King, a professor of psychology at \uc2 Rice University\uc2  who studies how pregnancy affects women in the workplace.\par \par \uc2 Similar stereotypes affect mothers -- 63 percent of whom are working while their youngest child is under three, according to the Labor Department -- but pregnancy is a more visible identity, said Ms. King. ''It can be a very physical characteristic in a way that motherhood isn't,'' she said. ''So some of those experiences and expectations may be exacerbated.''\par \par \uc2 In interviews with 10 pregnant or recently pregnant remote workers for this article, several women said that being visibly pregnant in real life but not on a work Zoom screen helped them feel more confident and less apprehensive about what parenthood might mean for their career. Christine Glandorf, who works in education technology and is due with her first child this month, said that like many professionals on the brink of parenthood, she worried that people's expectations of her in the workplace could change. Remote work solves part of that equation.\par \par \uc2 ''It's nice that it's literally not in people's face in any way, shape or form unless I choose for it to be a part of the conversation,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Meg Rashkin, who works at a digital content agency, is due in late March with her second child. She hasn't mentioned her pregnancy to her clients, which has allowed her to avoid awkward interactions that she experienced the first time around, like when a professional acquaintance asked if she'd been trying to get pregnant. ''I can go into a client meeting and just talk about business, and I don't have to say anything about my pregnancy to people I don't know that well,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 In a study published in the journal Personnel Psychology in 2020, Ms. King and her colleagues asked more than 100 pregnant women in a variety of industries to track how much their supervisors, without having been asked for help, did things like assign them less work so they wouldn't be overwhelmed or protect them from unpleasant news.\par \par \uc2 Women who received more unwanted help reported feeling less capable at work, and they were more likely to want to quit nine months postpartum.\par \par \uc2 ''The more you experienced those seemingly positive but actually benevolently sexist behaviors, the less you believed in yourself,'' Ms. King said.\par \par \uc2 Laura Little, an associate professor at the Terry College of Business at the University of Georgia, began studying pregnancy in the workplace while she was working on her Ph.D. in organizational behavior, after noticing a change in how she was treated during her own two pregnancies. Fewer classmates and faculty included her in new projects, and some assumed she would take her career less seriously after becoming a mother, she said.\par \par \uc2 When she told one faculty member that she was pregnant with her second child, he told her she'd never get tenure. A study she conducted with colleagues, which was published in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 2019, examined this apparent shift in treatment.\par \par \uc2 Pregnant women surveyed during several time periods in the study said they received less career encouragement, such as advice about how to navigate their organization, after they disclosed their pregnancies. Expectant fathers reported receiving slightly more encouragement after they revealed that they would become parents.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Little said that because of persistent, if outdated, gender norms, employers might have an attitude toward expecting fathers of, '''You're the breadwinner, and now you're more serious -- you're going to become more serious because you're having a baby,''' whereas women are more likely to be viewed as less serious about their careers once they disclose that they'll become mothers.\par \par \uc2 Despite younger generations' being more likely to say they believe women and men should be treated equally at work and at home, mothers in opposite-sex relationships still handle a majority of the housework and child care. The same pattern holds for parental leave. While almost half of men support the idea of paid paternity leave, fewer than five percent take more than two weeks.\par \par \uc2 In 2004, California began a paid family leave program that provides a portion of a new parent's salary for up to eight weeks. Though the program offers the same benefit to both new fathers and new mothers, a 2016 study found that it increased the leave women took by almost five weeks and the leave that men took by two to three days.\par \par \uc2 That was the disparity when new fathers actually had an option to take paid paternity leave. Most don't. Paid leave is still uncommon for both men and women. According to the \uc2 Bureau of Labor Statistics\uc2 , in 2021, 23 percent of all private industry workers had access to parental leave, up from 11 percent 10 years earlier. Although the Department of Labor stopped differentiating between maternity and paternity leave in its data more than 25 years ago, other surveys suggest that paid leave is far more uncommon for fathers.\par \par \uc2 These inequalities are one reason the gender pay gap, even between spouses, widens after women have children.\par \par \uc2 The virtual office may be relatively new, but women have long thought about how to shape their colleagues' perception of their pregnancies. In a 2015 study conducted by Ms. Little, researchers interviewed 35 women about their experience being pregnant at work.\par \par \uc2 About 80 percent of women brought up strategies such as hiding their bellies, working extra hard to prove they were dedicated or avoiding discussing their pregnancies. In most cases their goal was to be viewed as ''the same'' as before they were pregnant.\par \par \uc2 What has changed with the virtual office is that workers can downplay pregnancy more easily and for longer, and women have more control over when they inform their employers.\par \par \uc2 Ashlie Thomas decided not to mention that she was about 20 weeks pregnant while interviewing for a remote customer assistance job at a software company. ''If they decided not to hire me, I didn't want it to be based on my pregnancy,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 After she got the job, Ms. Thomas waited until she was about seven months pregnant to tell her employer she would be taking leave and planned to tell her team a week before her delivery date. The late announcement, she said, would allow her to feel that, ''I've demonstrated that I can do this job, and I'm capable, and now I'm comfortable sharing this with you.'' But she never made it to the meeting where she planned to share her news. That morning, she gave birth to her son.\par \par \uc2 Not all women who have kept their pregnancies out of their video conference calls say they are afraid of discrimination. Some of the women I spoke with for this article felt that the news was too private to share widely or that they didn't want to exacerbate their own anxiety about potentially losing the pregnancy.\par \par \uc2 Others thought bringing up their pregnancy would be a distraction to their work or were just happy to wear comfortable clothes and carry around a bottle of Tums without their co-workers watching.\par \par \uc2 Some women had also decided to reveal their pregnancy to their co-workers early on despite working remotely. Jacqueline Kim Perez, who works for a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  company, announced her pregnancy at a company meeting during the first trimester because she expected her colleagues to be supportive. (They were.)\par \par \uc2 Another woman who works as a recruiter -- and asked not to be named because she hadn't told most of her colleagues she is pregnant -- disclosed the news to her boss earlier than she would have liked because she needed accommodations for a high-risk pregnancy. Despite reassurances, she was fearful of how he would react. Recruiting is a metrics-driven industry, she said, and her numbers are suffering because of fatigue and time away for doctors appointments, which she believes could negatively impact her career no matter what her boss says.\par \par \uc2 Giving a growing bump less visibility can't compensate for an unsupportive organization, especially when pregnancy conflicts with a job, like when doctor appointments cut into billable hours or fatigue, nausea and other common pregnancy symptoms interfere with work responsibilities. And delaying a companywide announcement doesn't mean women will face less bias once they become mothers.\par \par \uc2 Still, most of the women I interviewed agreed there was something nice about having the option to act more like expectant fathers when discussing their pregnancies at work. When I finally started to roll out my news to some colleagues during my third trimester, I enjoyed occasionally acknowledging my major life change during the work day, especially when it was literally kicking me in the ribs. At the same time, I was happy to have a choice when it came to how and when to bring it up.\par \par \uc2 As companies summon people back to the office, fewer people will have that choice. But there is part of the remote work pregnancy experience that can be replicated offline, Ms. King said.\par \par \uc2 ''Some women do need help, and some women do want accommodations,'' she said. But ''you have to ask women what they want and what they need and not assume that we know.''\par \par \uc2 (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MARGEAUX WALTER FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) (BU1; BU7) \par \par \uc2 Document NYTF000020220306ei360005i\par }\page {\par\fs20{\*\shppict{\pict\pngblip\picw284\pich40\picscaley100\picscalex100\picwgoal4260\pichgoal600

\par\par \uc2 The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC\par \b \uc2 A Digital Artist Now Covers Walls Instead of Screens\b0\par\par\uc2 By Zachary Small \par \uc2 786 \uc2 words\par \uc2 5 March 2022\par \uc2 The New York Times\par \uc2 NYTF\par \uc2 Late Edition - Final\par 5\par \uc2 English\par \uc2 Copyright 2022 The New York Times Company.  All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 The digital artist known for NFTs is showing paintings and prints IRL at a Manhattan gallery. Will the art establishment finally take notice?\par \par \uc2 A cavalry of crypto enthusiasts funneled into Manhattan's TriBeCa neighborhood on Thursday evening, waiting outside Jack Hanley Gallery for a chance to meet their online art messiah in the flesh. In the mix were celebrities like Jimmy Fallon. It was a rock-star welcome for Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, who was putting the final touches on his images of decapitated tech executives and haywire science experiments.\par \par \uc2 Last year Winkelmann, 40, introduced the world to NFTs (or nonfungible tokens), starting with the $69 million sale of his ''Everydays -- The First 5000 Days'' at a Christie's auction, which set cryptocurrency on a crash course with culture. Now he is seeking approval from the art establishment with his first gallery exhibition, called ''Uncertain Future,'' which intends to convince critics that his work has more substance than what they see onscreen.\par \par \uc2 ''I'm kind of in a weird position,'' Winkelmann said at the gallery that night. ''I'm an outsider in the traditional art world. I didn't really feel like that until recently because I have been making this work in the digital art community for a very long time.''\par \par \uc2 So Winkelmann has produced an exhibition on walls instead of screens, with 13 paintings and prints that imagine an apocalyptic future where companies like \uc2 Amazon\uc2  and \uc2 Facebook\uc2  are reduced to rubble, their founders vessels of vanity and greed. Prices range from $75,000 to $300,000. Not that any of the hundreds who attended had a chance of buying a Beeple on Thursday night; the artworks were all on reserve, purchased, by the time the doors opened.\par \par \uc2 Still, Winkelmann remains bullish on NFTs, pairing each physical work with a \uc2 blockchain\uc2 -based collectible for authentication purposes. He said that much of his fortune made off the metaverse has gone back into his art.\par \par \uc2 Winkelmann recently moved into a new 50,000-square-foot industrial studio space in Charleston, S.C. His younger brother, Scott Winkelmann, quit his job at the airplane company \uc2 Boeing\uc2  to oversee the 16 full-time employees responsible for turning the artist's dreams into realities. (The staff includes several aerospace engineers from \uc2 Boeing\uc2 .) Other family members have joined the team, including the sons' mother, who has an office within the studio complex.\par \par \uc2 Several advisers from the worlds of crypto and culture have also joined team Beeple, including Jehan Chu, a \uc2 blockchain\uc2  venture capitalist and NFT collector who attended the opening.\par \par \uc2 ''Right now, there are two art worlds,'' said Chu, adding that he hoped more museums and galleries would soften to digital art. ''The traditional art world is still learning about the fundamental values of the NFT space.''\par \par \uc2 Development for the exhibition started nine months ago with Winkelmann calling the gallerist Jack Hanley. ''I was initially suspicious of all the hype,'' the dealer said. ''But Mike has a really cleareyed critique of big tech. He's also very funny.''\par \par \uc2 Hanley has spent the last 35 years championing outsider artists like Raymond Pettibon and Peter Saul, who slowly gained institutional acceptance after being dismissed for lacking a formal arts education. Winkelmann could be the next generation, the dealer said, though not everyone at the gallery agrees; Hanley confirmed that some artists he represents quit in protest of the Beeple exhibition, as Artnet News had reported.\par \par \uc2 Fans say that Winkelmann's ability to shock the establishment is part of his appeal.\par \par \uc2 ''The essence of Beeple is kind of between a satirist and a troll,'' said Simon Glenn, 26, a web developer who was admiring a print that imagines a future \uc2 Netflix\uc2  reduced to broken television sets and rusting cargo containers. ''It's asking what the company would be like without its people.''\par \par \uc2 Toward the back of the gallery, the artist Julia Sinelnikova, 32, was admiring a large painting that features the disfigured head of Jeff Bezos quarantined within an ''excess testosterone dump.'' She appreciated that Winkelmann was willing to critique the leaders of an industry that has supported his work.\par \par \uc2 ''I had been looking at Beeple's work for a long time just as entertainment,'' Sinelnikova said, squinting at the artist's phallus-filled portrait of the \uc2 Amazon\uc2  founder. ''But the works here in the gallery are much more beautiful and detailed than I expected.''\par \par \uc2 Mike Winkelmann, top center, also known as Beeple, at the Jack Hanley Gallery in Manhattan. His artwork on display there, above, is paired with nonfungible tokens for authentication purposes.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 Friends With Benefits is a V.I.P. lounge for crypto's creative class. Is it empty hype or the future of friendship?\par \par \uc2 On a recent afternoon, nine members of the crypto social club Friends With Benefits sat in the historic Bradbury Building in downtown Los Angeles, testing out a new beverage -- a flavored, sparkling yerba mat\u233\'00\'E9 that the group had developed with a coffee company.\par \par \uc2 As members sipped from their glasses, Joey Rubin, a leader of the group's Los Angeles chapter, explained that the drink contained adaptogens, herbs said to increase focus and stimulate creativity.\par \par \uc2 There were some blank stares. Adapto-what-nows?\par \par \uc2 ''It makes your soda $6 instead of $2,'' Mr. Rubin explained.\par \par \uc2 He was joking, but it was a decent metaphor for the organization, and for the state of cryptocurrency, as a whole. Like most things in the crypto world these days, Friends With Benefits -- a group that has been compared to a ''decentralized Soho House'' and a V.I.P. lounge for crypto's creative class -- is succeeding at generating hype and making money.\par \par \uc2 But its rise has onlookers wondering whether proponents of web3 -- a vision of a new internet, organized on decentralized databases known as blockchains -- are building something of real value, or whether it's mostly just overpriced fizz.\par \par \uc2 Friends With Benefits is what's known as a decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO -- a kind of digital co-op that uses cryptocurrency tokens to coordinate access, make payments and vote on group decisions.\par \par \uc2 DAOs, which have been described as ''financial flash mobs'' or ''group chats with bank accounts,'' are among the fastest-growing parts of the crypto ecosystem. There are thousands of DAOs organized around a variety of causes, from managing decentralized crypto exchanges to bidding on historic copies of the Constitution. The largest DAOs have thousands of members, and some control billions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency.\par \par \uc2 Friends With Benefits is not the biggest DAO, but it has become one of the buzziest. It has nearly 6,000 unique token holders, including musicians like Erykah Badu and Azealia Banks. Last year, it raised $10 million from investors such as the venture capital firm \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  in a funding round that valued it at $100 million.\par \par \uc2 The group was started in 2020 when Trevor McFedries, a digital entrepreneur, got the idea for an online club for his friends in the art and music worlds, with a private chat room that they would use special cryptocurrency tokens to unlock.\par \par \uc2 ''I wanted a place for my creative peers who were so skeptical of tech and finance to have a little light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. McFedries's theory -- which he tested by creating a token called $FWB and sending it to some of his \uc2 Twitter\uc2  followers -- was that attaching cryptocurrency to an online social club would give members an incentive to make it a fun, interesting place to hang out. The more fun people were having, he thought, the more newcomers would want to join, and the more valuable their tokens would become.\par \par \uc2 With Friends With Benefits, ''what you're getting is vibes,'' he said. ''This token is starting to reflect some of the value of those vibes.''\par \par \uc2 The group's rapid growth soon attracted investors, who saw Friends With Benefits less as a fully formed start-up than a crowd of crypto enthusiasts from which the next great web3 ventures might emerge. In a blog post announcing its investment, \uc2 Andreessen Horowitz\uc2  compared the group to the merchants of 13th-century Venice and the Homebrew Computer Club, the Silicon Valley hobbyist group where \uc2 Steve Jobs\uc2  and \uc2 Steve Wozniak\uc2  debuted the \uc2 Apple\uc2  computer in 1976.\par \par \uc2 ''This is like being able to sit in 2005, web2 era, and be part of a community that has the chance to build the next \uc2 Facebook\uc2  or \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ,'' said Steve Jang, the founder and managing partner of Kindred Ventures, which invested $1.5 million in Friends With Benefits.\par \par \uc2 To join, applicants are vetted by a committee of current members. If approved -- only about 20 percent are -- they receive certain perks based on how many of the group's in-house $FWB token they own.\par \par \uc2 Members with at least one $FWB token (current price: about $45) can read the group's newsletter and blog posts. Local membership, which requires holding at least five tokens, comes with limited access to the group's chat rooms on Discord, a talking and texting app, as well as entry to offline events. Global membership costs 75 $FWB -- roughly $3,400 today -- and includes access to all Discord chat rooms. (Friends With Benefits lent a Times reporter five $FWB tokens in order to view the Discord chats; those tokens have been returned, and the reporter does not have a stake in the organization.)\par \par \uc2 The group has chapters in New York, Los Angeles and London, but its real headquarters is its Discord server, where members swap outfit-of-the-day photos on the #selfies-n-fits channel, share financial advice on #trading-stonks and #taxes, and debate new proposals for community governance, such as a recent proposal to spend $20,000 from the group's treasury to develop a members-only subscription coffee service. (As with most DAOs, major group decisions are voted on by token holders and recorded permanently on the Ethereum \uc2 blockchain\uc2 .)\par \par \uc2 Culturally, the membership skews less ''Lamborghini-driving Bitcoin bros'' and more ''D.J.s from Williamsburg who dabble in Ethereum on the weekend.'' In a recent orientation session, new members introduced themselves: an intellectual-property lawyer, a poet-slash-investor, a brand strategist for \uc2 Nike\uc2 , a handful of musicians and software engineers.\par \par \uc2 ''We're kind of the anti-crypto crypto club,'' Raihan Anwar, a founder of Friends With Benefits, told the newbies.\par \par \uc2 Being organized as a DAO, rather than a traditional corporation, has advantages. The group can easily take stakes in members' projects, or reward them with $FWB tokens for contributing useful work. Members can leave anytime by selling their tokens. And if the price of $FWB rises, every member stands to benefit.\par \par \uc2 But attaching a community to a volatile crypto token has risks. Last year, a service that Friends With Benefits used to create its tokens was hacked. $FWB's value plunged 99 percent. The community voted to issue a replacement token and avoided a total collapse. Still, $FWB tokens now trade at around $50, roughly 75 percent lower than their peak.\par \par \uc2 Alex Zhang, 26 -- a former concert promoter who serves as the group's top leader, or ''mayor'' -- acknowledged that the drop in $FWB's price had worried some of the group's leaders.\par \par \uc2 ''It's the elephant in the room,'' he said. ''We're like, is this indicative of our performance?''\par \par \uc2 But he said owning a token together had given members a reason to cooperate to solve problems, rather than infighting or jostling for power.\par \par \uc2 ''There's so much value being created right now in FWB,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''People are launching NFT projects together, they're starting companies together. The value of friendships -- that's all now being captured by the network.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhang, who described the group as a ''headless media community lifestyle brand,'' predicts that members will eventually release dozens of projects under the Friends With Benefits umbrella, including magazines, music festivals and apparel lines.\par \par \uc2 ''We're talking to everyone from \uc2 Reebok\uc2  to Hennessey,'' he said. ''We're able to help cross those bridges and explain what the potential of crypto and web3 could do to these spaces.''\par \par \uc2 As Friends With Benefits has grown, it has encountered some of the same problems that might roil any offline social club. Last year, members voted to remove Cooper Turley, a crypto-world influencer, after decade-old, bigoted tweets of his surfaced.\par \par \uc2 And some members have struggled to reconcile the utopian rhetoric of crypto -- a tool for democratizing the financial system and removing gatekeepers and middlemen, supposedly -- with the reality of an exclusive members club that costs thousands of dollars to join.\par \par \uc2 ''Social clubs are one thing with expected elitism, but at least they don't front like they're inclusive,'' said Amelia Elle, a New York fashion designer. She joined the group after hearing that influential artists and creatives were involved but said spending time in the group's Discord server had been disappointing.\par \par \uc2 ''If we actually look at the active channels, it's a lot of men in start-ups who play an instrument or two,'' she said.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Zhang acknowledged that ''crypto inherently has a level of exclusivity to it.'' But he said the group prided itself on being more accessible, and more diverse, than most crypto-focused spaces.\par \par \uc2 ''We as a community have prioritized and put forth many initiatives to be as inclusive toward individuals that match our values as possible,'' he said.\par \par \uc2 So far, most of what Friends With Benefits has produced has been geared toward throwing parties and growing its membership, but it is beginning to branch out. The group is developing a member directory with customizable NFT name badges, planning a music festival and starting a fellowship program for web3 creators from underrepresented backgrounds.\par \par \uc2 In December, members voted to invest $18,530 from the DAO's treasury to develop the yerba mat\u233\'00\'E9 drink, its first physical product. Once the drink is ready, they plan to promote it at Friends With Benefits events before selling to a broader audience.\par \par \uc2 The group is also in talks to buy a stake in a defunct Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles, which it plans to turn into a hub. The restaurant, Hop Louie, was a Chinatown standby for decades before closing in 2016.\par \par \uc2 After the January meeting, half a dozen Friends With Benefits members visited the restaurant for the first time, wandering through the darkened upstairs and ducking around wooden lanterns still hung with red tassels. Spencer Kushner and Freddy Braidi, restaurateurs from the Boulevard Nightlife Group, which will operate the restaurant, walked them through the space's history and what a revitalized Hop Louie could look like.\par \par \uc2 The members speculated excitedly about the prospect. Mr. Rubin, the only one with restaurant industry experience, talked about keeping the revenue within the Friends With Benefits ecosystem or building wealth for the restaurant's employees -- applying the decentralized ownership structure of the DAO to an offline venture.\par \par \uc2 But like the rest of the DAO's activities, he noted, ''it could be shut down in a single vote.''\par \par \uc2 There was one final stop that night: a private dinner, where two chefs known professionally as BellyMan roasted crickets and grilled Wagyu beef over an open flame in a converted alleyway. A few dozen Friends With Benefits members milled around. Most were in their late 20s to early 40s; one couple toted their infant in a sling carrier.\par \par \uc2 Surveying the space, Laura Jaramillo, a product designer at the NFT start-up Upshot and a member of the product team for Friends With Benefits, summed up the group's heady optimism:\par \par \uc2 ''We're on the ground floor of what could be the beginning of everything.''\par \par \uc2 Above, from left, Naomi Menezes, Taylor Brock and Cameron Parkins at a dinner in January in Los Angeles.

All Rights Reserved. \par \par \uc2 In 2008, the handful of employees working for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  reached an impasse. Some were focused on preparing for a surge of new users to their social media platform. But one developer argued for another approach: Their platform, he said, shouldn't be a platform at all.\par \par \uc2 Instead, Blaine Cook envisioned \uc2 Twitter\uc2  as a backbone for online chatter, one that would allow its users to freely exchange messages with people on other social media platforms instead of locking them into conversations among themselves. He hacked together a prototype to demonstrate his idea.\par \par \uc2 But the other \uc2 Twitter\uc2  employees dismissed it, and Mr. Cook was eventually pushed out of the start-up. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  remained a tightly controlled island on the internet and eventually drew in hundreds of millions of users.\par \par \uc2 Now, over a decade later, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is reversing course. The company is pursuing the sort of decentralization Mr. Cook championed. It is funding an independent effort to build a so-called open protocol for social media. It is also weaving cryptocurrency into its app, and opening up to developers who want to build custom features for \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 Its newly appointed chief executive, \uc2 Parag Agrawal\uc2 , has championed decentralization inside the company, hiring cryptocurrency developers and prioritizing related projects. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  executives now believe that decentralizing the social media service will radically shift online power, moving it into the hands of users, and pose a fundamental challenge to the walled gardens of companies like \uc2 Facebook\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 A decentralized \uc2 Twitter\uc2  could take years to emerge and might look much the same as it does today. But it could allow users to set moderation rules for their own communities and ease the pressure \uc2 Twitter\uc2  faces from lawmakers over how it moderates content. It might also open new revenue streams for the company.\par \par \uc2 ''If Bitcoin existed before \uc2 Twitter\uc2  existed, I think we'd see very different revenue models,'' \uc2 Jack Dorsey\uc2 , a company co-founder who stepped down as its chief executive in November, said in a recent \uc2 Twitter\uc2  audio chat. ''We wouldn't be so dependent on ad revenue models.''\par \par \uc2 But the changes raise questions about how \uc2 Twitter\uc2  can reach its goal of doubling revenue over the next two years, even as it cedes some control over the currency by which social media companies are valued -- users and their data. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  also faces some doubts from the communities it hopes to unite: slighted developers, web3 acolytes and enthusiasts for open-source software.\par \par \uc2 The impulse to build decentralized systems is rooted in the foundation of the internet, with open protocols like the one Mr. Cook envisioned for \uc2 Twitter\uc2  at the heart of everyday technologies like email. \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is looking back at how the company started and how it strayed, and it is trying to tap into that old idealism for a new kind of business.\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dorsey said he was drawn to decentralized technologies like Bitcoin because they reminded him of the ethos of the early internet. ''It had the same sort of energy, it had the weirdness, it had the punk aspect of it,'' Mr. Dorsey said in the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  audio chat.\par \par \uc2 In a recent interview, Mr. Cook, who is now an engineer at Cond\u233\'00\'E9 Nast, said, ''It was obvious that we could decentralize \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 Over the years, he watched as the company grappled with many of the problems he thought could have been avoided through decentralization: regulatory challenges, debates over acceptable speech, and fights over which features to develop.\par \par \uc2 In 2019, Mr. Dorsey decided to decentralize \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , after discussions with Mr. Agrawal, then \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's chief technology officer, about the challenges facing the company.\par \par \uc2 That December, Mr. Dorsey announced his plan to fund the Bluesky project. ''\uc2 Twitter\uc2  was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard,'' Mr. Dorsey tweeted. ''For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized \uc2 Twitter\uc2 .''\par \par \uc2 The Bluesky project would eventually allow for the creation of new curation algorithms, which would show tweets at the top of users' timelines that differed from what \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's own algorithm showed. It would give users more choice about the kinds of content they saw, Mr. Dorsey said, and could allow \uc2 Twitter\uc2  to interoperate with other social media services.\par \par \uc2 Bluesky grabbed the attention of many technologists who were already working on decentralization. Soon small groups of them were meeting with Mr. Agrawal and Mr. Dorsey on Sundays to discuss the project, according to two participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private meetings, while others traded ideas in an online chat room.\par \par \uc2 Some Bluesky participants proposed a single app that piped in all their social media feeds. Others wanted custom algorithms that could, for instance, block them from seeing spoilers about their favorite TV show. And some were focused on making their online identities portable, so that an account could be moved between social media companies the way a phone number can be moved from \uc2 AT&T\uc2  to \uc2 Verizon\uc2 .\par \par \uc2 ''One of the things that Bluesky would offer is curation and filtering experiences that are independent of those offered by the social media proprietorships,'' said Tim Bray, an internet software pioneer and a former vice president at \uc2 Amazon\uc2  who participated in some of the discussions.\par \par \uc2 Jay Graber, a cryptocurrency developer, was selected in August to lead the Bluesky organization. And in February, Ms. Graber announced that the project had officially registered as a public benefit corporation and was building a prototype.\par \par \uc2 The project caught the attention of engineers at Reddit, who had preliminary discussions with \uc2 Twitter\uc2  engineers about how their sites might someday interoperate, two people familiar with the conversations said, but the companies have not formally agreed to any plans to work together.\par \par \uc2 Some skeptics believe \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is jumping on the web3 bandwagon, joining a trendy movement in tech to shift many services, including social media, to so-called \uc2 blockchain\uc2  technology. But executives say \uc2 Twitter\uc2  is catering to what an overwhelming number of users want, while following the decentralization mandate that Mr. Dorsey laid out before he departed as chief executive in November.\par \par \uc2 ''The crypto community lives on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 ,'' said Esther Crawford, a staff product manager who oversees \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's web3 efforts. ''To ignore that community or disregard it is a missed opportunity.''\par \par \uc2 In September, Ms. Crawford led \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's expansion of its tipping feature, allowing users to pay one another in cash or Bitcoin. And in January, the company began allowing paying users to display NFTs -- cryptographic collectibles that represent pieces of digital art -- as their profile pictures. (Lest anyone mistake a regular profile picture for an NFT, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  displays NFT profile pictures with a unique hexagonal border.)\par \par \uc2 In December, conversations about NFTs made up 1.2 percent of the entire conversation on \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , a company spokeswoman said. Users sent more than 220 million tweets about NFTs in 2021, making them a larger conversation topic than movies, which generated about 207 million tweets.\par \par \uc2 Ms. Crawford added that \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's embrace of cryptocurrencies had a practical explanation. For years, the company has been growing more rapidly outside the United States than within it, and allowing users to exchange money across borders will help facilitate that growth.\par \par \uc2 In November, \uc2 Twitter\uc2  expanded unpaid access to its fire hose of data, inviting developers to create new ways for users to interact with the platform. Tracy Chou, the chief executive of the anti-harassment tool Block Party, uses access to \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's data to build features that filter abusive messages out of a user's \uc2 Twitter\uc2  notifications. Her work represents the kind of custom experience that \uc2 Twitter\uc2  might not build in-house but still wants for its users.\par \par \uc2 ''If we just look at where the platforms are now in terms of addressing online harms, they are not doing a very good job,'' Ms. Chou said. ''An algorithm that is the best overall, an average best experience, definitely is still going to leave out a lot of people who don't like that experience.''\par \par \uc2 But while \uc2 Twitter\uc2  has given developers like Ms. Chou the data they need to build custom experiences, the company has also yanked it away. It has locked down the kinds of data that developers use several times, most recently in 2018, when it limited access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., effectively breaking a number of smaller companies' apps.\par \par \uc2 Anil Dash, who helped found ThinkUp, a company that relied on data from \uc2 Twitter\uc2 , \uc2 Facebook\uc2  and \uc2 Instagram\uc2 , recalled telling \uc2 Twitter\uc2  executives that they had effectively killed his company by cutting off data access.\par \par \uc2 ''Developers do not trust them,'' Mr. Dash said. ''You are Lucy with the football and we are Charlie Brown, and you have pulled the football away 100 times.''\par \par \uc2 Mr. Dash, who is now the chief executive of Glitch, said \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's decentralization strategy hinged on its ability to woo developers back. ''It's not insurmountable, but it's the fundamental condition of this entire strategy succeeding: Convince the most skeptical audience to trust them again.''\par \par \uc2 Amir Shevat, \uc2 Twitter\uc2 's head of product for developers, got the job by offering similar criticism to Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Agrawal. At the time, he was a top executive at Reshuffle, a developer platform. But after discussions about developer access, the \uc2 Twitter\uc2  executives agreed to acquire Reshuffle last March.\par \par \uc2 ''Talking to Jack and Parag, they recognized that \uc2 Twitter\uc2  before was a lot more open,'' Mr. Shevat said in an interview. He added, ''I think what you're seeing is a move back into that.''\par \par \uc2 ''If you decentralize your platform and you give developers more powers to make richer experiences and better, safer timelines, then everybody benefits from this,'' he also said.\par \par \uc2 ''It was obvious that we could decentralize Twitter,'' said Blaine Cook, who championed a so-called open protocol during the company's early days.
