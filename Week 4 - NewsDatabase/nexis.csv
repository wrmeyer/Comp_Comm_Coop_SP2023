"1","Is the Inflation Storm Letting Up?; Paul Krugman","December 26, 2022 Monday 11:20 EST","OPINION",912,"Paul Krugman","It’s too soon to celebrate, but the news is improving.","The average national price of regular gasoline this Christmas was almost 20 cents a gallon lower than it was a year earlier. Prices at the pump are still higher than they were during the pandemic slump, when economic shutdowns depressed world oil prices, but the affordability of fuel — as measured by the ratio of the average wage to gas prices — is most of the way back to pre-Covid levels. Now, gas prices aren’t a good measure either of economic health or of successful economic policy — although if you listened to Republican ads during the midterms, you might have thought otherwise. But subsiding prices at the pump are only one of many indicators that the inflationary storm of 2021 to ’22 is letting up. Remember the supply-chain crisis, with shipping rates soaring to many times their normal level? It’s over. More broadly, recent reports on the inflation measures the Federal Reserve traditionally uses to guide its interest rate policy have been really, really good. So is this going to be the winter of our diminishing discontent? After the nasty shocks of the past two years, nobody wants to get too excited by positive news. Having greatly underestimated past inflation risks myself, I’m working hard on curbing my enthusiasm, and the Fed, which is worried about its credibility, is even more inclined to look for clouds in the silver lining. And those clouds are there, as I’ll explain in a minute. It’s much too soon to declare all clear on the inflation front. But there has been a big role reversal in the inflation debate. Last year optimists like me were trying to explain away the bad news. Now pessimists are trying to explain away the good news. What’s really striking about the improvement in inflation numbers is that so far, at least, it hasn’t followed the pessimists’ script. Disinflation, many commentators insisted, would require a sustained period of high unemployment — say, at least a 5 percent unemployment rate for five years. And to be fair, this prediction could still be vindicated if recent progress against inflation turns out to be a false dawn. However, inflation has declined rapidly, even with unemployment still near record lows. What explains falling inflation? It now looks as if much, although not all, of the big inflation surge reflected one-time events associated with the pandemic and its aftermath — which was what Team Transitory (including me) claimed all along, except that transitory effects were both bigger and longer lasting than any of us imagined. First came those supply chain issues. As consumers, fearing risks of infection, avoided in-person services — such as dining out — and purchased physical goods instead, the world faced a sudden shortage of shipping containers, port capacity and more. Prices of many goods soared as the logistics of globalization proved less robust and flexible than we realized. Then came a surge in demand for housing, probably caused largely by the pandemic-driven rise in remote work. The result was a spike in rental rates. Since official statistics use market rents to estimate the overall cost of shelter and shelter, in turn, is a large part of measured inflation, this sent inflation higher even as supply-chain problems eased. But new data from the Cleveland Fed confirms what private firms have been telling us for several months: Rapid rent increases for new tenants have stopped, and rents may well be falling. Because most renters are on one-year leases, official measures of housing costs — and overall inflation numbers that fail to account for the lag — don’t yet reflect this slowdown. But housing has gone from a major driver of inflation to a stabilizing force. So why shouldn’t we be celebrating? You can pick over the entrails of the inflation numbers looking for bad omens, but I’m ever less convinced that anybody, myself included, understands inflation well enough to do this in a useful way. Basically, as you exclude more and more items from your measure in search of “underlying” inflation, what you’re left with becomes increasingly strange and unreliable. Instead, my concern (and, I believe, the Fed’s) comes down to the fact that the job market still looks very hot, with wages rising too fast to be consistent with acceptably low inflation. What I would point out, however, is that many workers’ salaries are like apartment rents, in the sense that they get reset only once a year, so official numbers on wages will lag a cooling market, and there is some evidence that labor markets are, in fact, cooling. Official reports in January — especially on job openings early in the month and on employment costs at the end — may (or may not) give us more clarity on whether this cooling is real or sufficient. Oh, and with visible inflation slowing, the risks of a wage-price spiral, which I never thought were very large, are receding even further. So we’ve had some seriously encouraging inflation news. There are still reasons to worry, and the news isn’t solid enough to justify breaking out the Champagne. But given the season, I am going to indulge at least in a glass or two of eggnog.

"2","A Measure Of Inflation Cools Down In November","December 24, 2022 Saturday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1079,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"The Personal Consumption Expenditures index showed prices increased 5.5 percent last month, as consumer spending pulled back. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure is showing signs of moderating after months of rapid price increases, and a closely watched gauge of consumer spending slowed last month, a sign that the economy may have less steam as it heads into 2023.    The Personal Consumption Expenditures price index climbed 5.5 percent in November from a year earlier, a slowdown from 6.1 percent in the previous reading. Stripped of food and fuel costs, which jump around, a so-called core price measure climbed 4.7 percent, down from 5 percent in the previous reading. Both figures were roughly in line with economist forecasts.   Although inflation is slowing, it still has a long way to go to return to a more normal pace. The Fed has raised interest rates at the fastest clip in decades this year as it has tried to temper consumer and business demand, hoping to force price increases to moderate. Those rate increases are now trickling through the economy, slowing the housing market, cooling demand for new business investments and potentially weakening the labor market.   But it remains to be seen just how much the Fed's policy changes will slow down the overall economy. So far, spending and hiring have both been relatively resilient -- which has left policymakers and economists alike closely watching each new data report, like the one released Friday, for any hint at how consumers are faring.   ''Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his final news conference of the year.   The economic figures on Friday showed that consumer spending slowed in November, climbing just 0.1 percent from October, less than the 0.2 percent economists had forecast. But spending in October was revised up slightly, and posted a robust 0.9 percent increase -- evidence that it is still hard to get a handle on the trajectory for consumption.   Those figures do not account for inflation. Adjusted for price increases, spending did not grow at all.   And under the surface, the data pointed to a continued shift in what Americans are buying: Spending on services continues to grow, even as people buy fewer goods, like furniture and clothing.   Even if they are not yet conclusive, signs of cooling consumer demand are likely to be welcome news for officials at the Fed. The economy slowed notably in 2022 from its rapid expansion in 2021, but policymakers at the Fed believe that it needs to remain weaker than usual through next year to get inflation back down to the 2 percent that they shoot for on average over time.   That's because rapid inflation -- which began as pandemic-induced supply shortages collided with strong consumer demand -- has become more stubborn over time. It now spans a variety of service categories, from dentist visits to meals out at restaurants. Those sorts of price gains tend to be fueled by increasing wages, and can take time to stamp out.   ''The low-hanging fruit is working out: Energy components and supply chain issues are coming off,'' Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities, said of the recent cooling in inflation. But services inflation, she said, is likely to be a more intractable problem.   ''They still talk about inflation as public enemy No. 1, but the narrative around inflation has moved to wages and the labor market,'' Ms. Misra said.   The Fed is hoping that weighing down the broader economy will help to bring demand for workers back into balance with the supply of available employees. As conditions moderate, policymakers think, pay gains will slow and inflation will be able to return fully to normal, paving the way for more sustainable growth.   ''Looking ahead, we expect a deceleration in household spending as the Fed hikes rates further in 2023,'' Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in response to the data released on Friday.   But nailing that landing is sure to be difficult. Officials will have to guess just how high interest rates need to go -- and how long they need to stay there -- to slow the economy and price increases sufficiently. That is an inexact science, and there is a risk that officials will cause a painful recession as they try to slow down the economy.   As a result, Fed officials this month began to move rates at a more gradual pace, and have hinted that they could stop raising them altogether at some point in 2023. That will give them time to see how their policy changes so far are playing through the economy.   ''It's now not so important how fast we go. It's far more important to think, 'What is the ultimate level?''' Mr. Powell said at his latest news conference. ''And then it's -- at a certain point, the question will become, 'How long do we remain restrictive?'''   Among other challenges, it is tough to guess how American consumers, who drive about 70 percent of the economy, will behave next year. They are eking out income gains even counting for inflation in recent months, and they are still sitting on savings amassed during the pandemic. That could help to keep them shopping into 2023.   But at the same time, many families have been drawing down their extra funds and the nation's savings rate -- how much people tuck away out of their disposable income -- has dipped to low levels. It is unclear how long people will be willing to spend out of their nest eggs before they begin to meaningfully pull back.   The White House, for its part, has been welcoming any sign that the economy remains resilient at price increases fade.   ''There will be more ups and downs in the year ahead, but we are making progress building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out,'' President Biden said in a release after the report on Friday. ''I'm optimistic for the year ahead.''   But as the Fed's policy changes play out, many economists expect that the economy will lose momentum and eventually contract next year.   Analysts at Capital Economics ''continue to expect a mild recession next year,'' Andrew Hunter, the firm's senior U.S. economist, wrote in a research note on Friday. He noted that consumption was pulling back and that business investment was likely to ''weaken more markedly next year as the full impact of the Fed's aggressive tightening this year feeds through.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/23/business/economy/consumer-spending-inflation-november.html  Graphic"
"3","Wonking Out: Lies, Damned Lies and ‘Underlying’ Inflation; Paul Krugman","December 16, 2022 Friday 14:32 EST","OPINION",1124,"Paul Krugman","There are many ways of measuring inflation, and they’re saying increasingly different things.","Tuesday’s inflation report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics was incredibly good — that is, it was too good to be credible. On their face, the numbers seemed to show that inflation has stopped dead in its tracks, or more accurately that it is back down to more or less the Federal Reserve’s long-run target of 2 percent. However, few analysts believe that the fight against inflation has already been won; hey, even I don’t believe that. But how do we come to that conclusion? How do we extract the signal from the noise? Part of the answer is to smooth out the data by looking at changes over several months. Much reporting in the media focuses on changes over the past year, but that seems like too long a window in a rapidly changing economy. Like many other economists, I’ve been focusing mainly on three-month changes. Even that, however, isn’t enough to correct for wild price swings that clearly shouldn’t be driving economic policy. Back in 1975, Robert Gordon of Northwestern University suggested focusing on inflation excluding volatile food and energy prices; this so-called core measure has become a standard way to assess “underlying” inflation. Since then, other measures have also been proposed, and until recently, they all tended to tell more or less similar stories. At this point, however, various measures of core inflation are all over the map. Here’s a picture of inflation rates over the past three months (calculated as annual rates of change) for six measures I’ve been following; I’ll explain the measures and why we might want to use them in a minute: OK, depending on which measure you choose, underlying inflation is anywhere from almost 7 percent — way above the Fed’s target — to less than 1 percent, well below the target. That’s not helpful! I don’t think this is mainly a data problem. What we have, instead, is a conceptual problem: What do we mean by “underlying” inflation, anyway? The answer, I’d argue, is that we mean two different things, which have been fairly well aligned in the past but aren’t at all the same thing now. But first, about those measures: Median inflation, calculated by the Cleveland Fed, tries to smooth out volatility by looking at the rate of inflation of goods in the middle of the overall distribution, with half of other goods experiencing higher inflation, half lower. Trimmed mean inflation is conceptually similar, but throws out less information, excluding only the biggest and smallest 8 percent of price changes. Traditional core is the original measure, excluding only food and energy prices. “Supercore” is traditional core, further excluding shelter inflation — I’ll talk in a second about why you might want to do that. Superdupercore (my phrase) is supercore with the further exclusion of used car prices, which have fluctuated wildly in recent months. Furman core (also my term) is a measure calculated by Harvard’s Jason Furman (following up on a suggestion by yours truly). It goes back to traditional core, but replaces shelter inflation as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics with market rents as estimated by private companies like Zillow. Why are these measures looking so different? A lot of it has to do with housing. Official statistics estimate the average amount paid by renters; Americans who own their homes are assumed to pay an “Owners Equivalent Rent” that is an estimate of what they would be paying if renting their houses to themselves, an estimate mainly based on actual apartment rents. These rents, actual and imputed, make up almost 40 percent of traditional core inflation; in practice they play an even more dominant role in median and trimmed-mean inflation. But here’s the thing: Most renters are on long-term leases, so official rent estimates, which are based on what people actually pay, mostly reflect what new tenants were paying many months ago. Ordinarily, that’s not a big issue. But wild things have been happening in rental markets lately. There was a huge surge in demand for more space in 2021, probably driven by the rise in working from home, which has now petered out. As a result, new-tenant rents had soared, but are now falling. And official rent measures are therefore basically reflecting what was happening a long time ago rather than what’s happening now. Here are three-month rates of change in the B.L.S. rent measure and Zillow’s new-apartment rental measure: So you can more or less understand why the various core indicators look so different: Measures that use official housing costs are highly elevated because they’re still reflecting a rent surge that is now basically behind us, while measures that either exclude housing or use current market rents are much lower. In that case, however, what’s the right measure? Now comes the conceptual problem I mentioned earlier: What does “underlying” inflation mean, anyway? One possible answer is that it means inflation driven by generally excessive spending rather than issues specific to particular sectors of the economy. If that’s what we’re worried about, we should probably be looking at measures that, one way or another, take lagged market rents out of the picture. What many economists probably have in mind, however, is something else: They’re worried about inflation getting “entrenched” in the economy. Textbook models of inflation say that once businesses and workers have come to expect persistent inflation, that inflation becomes self-perpetuating, because people set prices and wages based on the belief that everyone else will be raising prices and wages in the future. And once inflation has become entrenched, the story goes, getting it down again requires a nasty economic slump. So which of these various core measures tells us whether inflation is getting entrenched? As best as I can tell, none of them. We do, however, have some direct evidence on inflation expectations. For example, here are the results of an ongoing survey by the New York Fed: People do expect elevated inflation over the next year, probably because they’re extrapolating from elevated gas prices earlier this year. But medium-term inflation expectations are quite low. There’s just no sign of inflation getting entrenched. So where are we on the inflation fight? Until recently it was clear that overall spending was rising too fast to be consistent with low inflation, and my superdupercore measure suggests that this may still be true. I certainly understand why the Fed isn’t ready to declare victory yet. But given the absence of evidence that inflation is getting entrenched, victory may be a lot closer than many people imagine."
"4","Wary Outlook After a Misfire Over Inflation","December 13, 2022 Tuesday","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1",1380,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"Economists misjudged how much staying power inflation would have. Next year could be better -- but there's ample room for humility. At this time last year, economists were predicting that inflation would swiftly fade in 2022 as supply chain issues cleared, consumers shifted from goods to services spending and pandemic relief waned. They are now forecasting the same thing for 2023, citing many of the same reasons.    But as consumers know, predictions of a big inflation moderation this year were wrong. While price increases have started to slow slightly, they are still hovering near four-decade highs. Economists expect fresh data scheduled for release on Tuesday to show that the Consumer Price Index climbed by 7.3 percent in the year through November.    That raises the question: Should America believe this round of inflation optimism?   ''There is better reason to believe that inflation will fall this year than last year,'' said Jason Furman, an economist from Harvard who was skeptical of last year's forecasts for a quick return to normal. Still, ''if you pocket all the good news and ignore the countervailing bad news, that's a mistake.''   Economists are slightly less optimistic than last year.   Economists see inflation fading notably in the months ahead, but after a year of foiled expectations, they aren't penciling in quite as drastic a decline as they were last December.   The Fed officially targets the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which is related to the consumer price measure. Officials particularly watch a version of the number that illustrates underlying inflation trends by stripping out volatile food and fuel prices -- so those forecasts give the best snapshot of what experts are anticipating.   Last year, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected that so-called core index to fall to 2.5 percent by the end of 2022. Instead, it is running at 5 percent, twice that pace.   This year, forecasters expect inflation to fade to 3 percent by the end of 2023.   The Federal Reserve's predictions have followed a similar pattern. As of last December, central bankers expected core inflation to end 2022 at 2.7 percent. Their September projections showed price increases easing to 3.1 percent by the end of next year. Fed officials will release a new set of inflation forecasts for 2023 on Wednesday following their December policy meeting.   Supply chains are healing.   One reason to think that the anticipated but elusive inflation slowdown will finally show up in 2023 ties back to supply chains.   At this time last year, economists were hopeful that snarls in global shipping and manufacturing would soon clear; consumer spending would shift away from goods and back to services; and the combination would allow supply and demand to come back into balance, slowing price increases on everything from cars to couches. That has happened, but only gradually. It has also taken longer to translate into lower consumer prices than some economists had expected.   But the expected shift is finally, if belatedly, showing up. After months of supply chain healing, consumers are now beginning to feel the benefit. Used car prices began declining meaningfully in October inflation data, furniture prices are slumping and apparel is falling in price. Similar cost declines are expected to weigh on inflation next year.   ''It is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished, but if current trends continue, goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a recent speech.   The Fed is working on cooling demand.   Unfortunately, moderation in goods prices alone would probably fail to return America to a normal inflation rate, because price increases for services have been accelerating. That category -- which covers everything from meals out to monthly rent -- accounted for half of consumer price inflation in October, based on a Bloomberg breakdown, up from less than a third a year earlier.   Many types of service inflation are closely intertwined with what's happening in the job market. For companies including hair salons, restaurant chains and tax accountants, paying employees is typically a major, if not the biggest, cost of doing business. When workers are scarce and wages are climbing rapidly, businesses are more likely to raise their prices to try to cover heftier labor bills.   That means that today's very low unemployment and abnormally rapid wage growth could help to keep price increases faster than usual, even though the job market wasn't a big driver of the initial burst in inflation.   That is where Fed policy could come in. Companies can only charge more if their customers are able -- and willing -- to pay more. The Fed can stop that chain reaction by lifting interest rates to slow demand.   Policymakers have raised interest rates from near-zero at the start of 2022 to nearly 4 percent, and are expected to make another interest rate increase this week. Those moves have made it more expensive to borrow money to buy a house, finance a big purchase or expand a business.   The knock-on effects are now trickling through the economy: Fewer house sales could eventually mean less hiring in construction and manufacturing, which in turn would mean less spending in the local economies where would-be builders and factory workers live. As the job market slows down and wage growth moderates, demand is expected to weaken for everything from dinners out to air travel.   ''Slower wage growth will reduce upward pressure on services inflation,'' economists at Goldman Sachs predicted. But the process might take time. They expect the labor market for health care workers in particular to remain hot and put upward pressure on inflation next year, for instance.   Rent growth is moderating.   In one service category, though, a 2023 inflation deceleration is a fairly sure bet: rents.   Rent increases take time to flow into measured inflation because existing tenants do not start paying more until they renew their leases. That means that a 2021 pop in new rents has been slowly working its way into the official price numbers, pushing up inflation throughout 2022.   Market-based rents have begun to cool or even fall in recent months, which suggests that rent growth should also begin to moderate. The uncertainty is when the slowdown will happen -- some economists think as early as next spring -- and how quickly rents will decelerate.   But big wild cards remain.   The challenge with forecasting inflation is that while it is possible to make guesses about specific categories like rent, many inflation drivers come as a surprise. Forecasters in 2021 could not have guessed that Russia would invade Ukraine in early 2022, sharply pushing up food and fuel prices.   Likewise, it is hard to guess what will happen on the geopolitical stage next year. An escalation of the conflict in Europe could put renewed pressure on gas prices. The return of Chinese consumers after years of rolling lockdowns could lead to more people competing for goods in the global market.   And things could simply take longer than expected to return to normal. That's partly what happened in 2022. Consumption and the labor market both outstripped expectations, keeping the pressure on prices.   ''The economy was more resilient than expected,'' said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at Macro Policy Perspectives. ''Supply chain problems lasted a lot longer than expected and have been difficult to forecast on the way up and down.''   How quickly demand will slow is still uncertain. The labor market is expected to cool, but for now it is strong. And many households are still in solid financial shape. They amassed $2.3 trillion in extra savings during the pandemic thanks to months stuck at home and government stimulus, and still had about $1.7 trillion of that by mid-2022, based on Fed research.   Those nest eggs have helped Americans to sustain their spending this year, giving companies the ability to raise prices without scaring away customers -- a trend that could continue, at least for a while.   The challenge in forecasting, Mr. Furman said, is that there's ''a powerful desire to tell a happy story.'' So far, inflation has been anything but. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/12/business/economy/inflation-forecasts-historical-outlook.html  Graphic"
"5","Inflation Slows, Leading to Hope Of 'Soft Landing'","December 14, 2022 Wednesday","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1",1315,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"Consumer Price Index data reinforces that inflation is beginning to slow down just ahead of the Federal Reserve's December rate decision. Inflation slowed more sharply than expected in November, an encouraging sign for both Federal Reserve officials and consumers that 18 months of rapid and unrelenting price increases are beginning to meaningfully abate.    The new data is unlikely to alter the Fed's plan to raise interest rates by another half point at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.    But the moderation in inflation, which affected used cars, some types of food and airline tickets, caused investors to speculate that the Fed could pursue a less aggressive policy path next year -- potentially increasing the chances of a ''soft landing,'' or one in which the economy slows gradually and without a painful recession.   Stock prices jumped sharply after government data showed that inflation eased to 7.1 percent in the year through November, down from 7.7 percent in the previous reading and less than economists had expected.   The Fed, which has been rapidly raising rates in three-quarter point increments, is expected to make a smaller move on Wednesday, bringing rates to a range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent. Central bankers will also release economic projections showing how much they expect to raise interest rates next year, and investors are now betting that they will slow to quarter-point adjustments by their February meeting as fading price pressures give them latitude to proceed more cautiously.   ''The overall picture is definitely improving,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ''It's unambiguously good news, but it would not be fair to say that inflation is falling everywhere -- there are still pockets of big increases.''   While price increases are not yet slowing across the board, they are moderating for key goods and services that consumers buy every day, including gas and meat. That is good news for President Biden, who has struggled to convince Americans that the economy is strong as the surging cost of living erodes voter confidence.   ''Inflation is coming down in America,'' Mr. Biden said during remarks at the White House on Tuesday morning. He hailed the report as ''news that provides some optimism for the holiday season, and I would argue, the year ahead.''   Still, he cautioned that the nation could face more setbacks in its efforts to bring inflation under control. ''We shouldn't take anything for granted,'' he said.   Inflation remains unusually rapid for now: Tuesday's 7.1 percent reading is an improvement, but it is still much faster than the roughly 2 percent that prevailed before the pandemic.   The details of the report suggested that further cooling is likely in store.   Many of the categories in which price increases are now slowing are tied more to the pandemic and supply chains than to Fed policy. For instance, food and fuel price jumps are moderating after climbing rapidly earlier this year, an effect of transportation issues and fallout from the war in Ukraine. Used car prices, which were severely elevated by a collision of consumer demand and parts shortages, are now falling sharply.   Officials are ''getting the help that they expected'' from healing supply chains and cheaper goods, said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America.   The question now is what will happen with inflation in service categories, which can be more stubborn and difficult to cool. The Fed has lifted interest rates from just above zero early this year to about 4 percent -- and those higher borrowing costs are now trickling through the economy to cool both consumer demand and the labor market. That should slow down many types of inflation in 2023.   For instance, used car prices are likely to continue to decline as car loans become so pricey that would-be buyers are squeezed out of the market. Wage growth remains rapid now, but as businesses hold off on expansions or lay off workers, it is expected to slow, which could help price changes for many kinds of services to slow down.   Already, market-based rent increases have pulled back sharply, which should trickle into inflation data over the next year.   Rents were 7.9 percent higher than a year earlier in November, the fastest year-over-year increase in four decades, as tenants renew their leases after a big pop in market rent prices in 2021 and early 2022. That is poised to slow down notably in the coming months.   The Consumer Price Index figures released on Tuesday are closely watched because they are the first major inflation data points to come out each month. The Fed officially targets a more delayed measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, and aims for 2 percent on average over time. That measure came in at 6 percent in the year through October.   As price increases begin to moderate notably, investors and households alike are wondering how high the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in 2023 -- and how long officials will leave borrowing costs elevated.   One camp argues that the central bank should be cautious, avoiding doing too much and causing a recession at a time when price increases are already on their way back toward normal.   But other economists and policymakers contend that underlying inflation pressures remain. They warn that the Fed needs to stick with the program to ensure that inflation does not become a permanent feature of the American economy.   Services inflation contributed about 3.9 percentage points of November's inflation reading. Much of that comes from the rapid increase in rents that is poised to taper off, but some is from a tick-up in other categories, such as garbage collection, dentist visits and tickets to sports games.    ''Although the long awaited moderation in goods categories is finally underway, the underlying pace of inflation still looks inconsistent with the Fed's target,'' Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at PIMCO, wrote in a note following the inflation release.   If price increases remained stubbornly higher for years on end, they could begin to feed on themselves, with consumers asking for bigger raises to keep up and companies instituting bigger or more frequent price adjustments to cover rising labor bills. That sort of self-fulfilling cycle is exactly what the Fed is trying to avoid.   In the 1970s, officials allowed inflation to remain slightly more rapid than usual for years on end, which created what economists since have called an ''inflationary psychology.'' When oil prices spiked for geopolitical reasons, an already elevated inflation base and high inflation expectations helped price increases climb drastically. Fed policymakers ultimately raised rates to nearly 20 percent and pushed unemployment to double digits to bring price moves back under control.   Central bankers today want to avoid a rerun of that painful experience. For now, they have signaled that they expect to raise interest rates slightly in early 2023, then leave them at high levels for some time to constrain the economy.   ''It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech late last month. ''We will stay the course until the job is done.''   Ms. Wilding said she expected the labor market to slow down notably in early 2023, allowing the Fed to stop raising interest rates, as did Mr. Shepherdson at Pantheon.   ''I think that they are going to be done in February,'' he said. But he expects rates to remain at a relatively high rate -- just shy of 5 percent -- for a long time, as the Fed avoids letting up too soon and allowing inflation to stage a comeback.   ''They're going to be very cautious: They've had their fingers burned.''

Stripped of food and fuel costs, which jump around, a so-called core price measure climbed 4.7 percent, down from 5 percent in the previous reading. Both figures were roughly in line with economist forecasts. Although inflation is slowing, it still has a long way to go to return to a more normal pace. The Fed has raised interest rates at the fastest clip in decades this year as it has tried to temper consumer and business demand, hoping to force price increases to moderate. Those rate increases are now trickling through the economy, slowing the housing market, cooling demand for new business investments and potentially weakening the labor market. But it remains to be seen just how much the Fed’s policy changes will slow down the overall economy. So far, spending and hiring have both been relatively resilient — which has left policymakers and economists alike closely watching each new data report, like the one released Friday, for any hint at how consumers are faring. “Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market conditions,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said at his final news conference of the year. The economic figures on Friday showed that consumer spending slowed in November, climbing just 0.1 percent from October, less than the 0.2 percent economists had forecast. But spending in October was revised up slightly, and posted a robust 0.9 percent increase — evidence that it is still hard to get a handle on the trajectory for consumption. Those figures do not account for inflation. Adjusted for price increases, spending did not grow at all. And under the surface, the data pointed to a continued shift in what Americans are buying: Spending on services continues to grow, even as people buy fewer goods, like furniture and clothing. Even if they are not yet conclusive, signs of cooling consumer demand are likely to be welcome news for officials at the Fed. The economy slowed notably in 2022 from its rapid expansion in 2021, but policymakers at the Fed believe that it needs to remain weaker than usual through next year to get inflation back down to the 2 percent that they shoot for on average over time. That’s because rapid inflation — which began as pandemic-induced supply shortages collided with strong consumer demand — has become more stubborn over time. It now spans a variety of service categories, from dentist visits to meals out at restaurants. Those sorts of price gains tend to be fueled by increasing wages, and can take time to stamp out. “The low-hanging fruit is working out: Energy components and supply chain issues are coming off,” Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities, said of the recent cooling in inflation. But services inflation, she said, is likely to be a more intractable problem. “They still talk about inflation as public enemy No. 1, but the narrative around inflation has moved to wages and the labor market,” Ms. Misra said. The Fed is hoping that weighing down the broader economy will help to bring demand for workers back into balance with the supply of available employees. As conditions moderate, policymakers think, pay gains will slow and inflation will be able to return fully to normal, paving the way for more sustainable growth. “Looking ahead, we expect a deceleration in household spending as the Fed hikes rates further in 2023,” Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in response to the data released on Friday. But nailing that landing is sure to be difficult. Officials will have to guess just how high interest rates need to go — and how long they need to stay there — to slow the economy and price increases sufficiently. That is an inexact science, and there is a risk that officials will cause a painful recession as they try to slow down the economy. As a result, Fed officials this month began to move rates at a more gradual pace, and have hinted that they could stop raising them altogether at some point in 2023. That will give them time to see how their policy changes so far are playing through the economy. “It’s now not so important how fast we go. It’s far more important to think, ‘What is the ultimate level?’” Mr. Powell said at his latest news conference. “And then it’s — at a certain point, the question will become, ‘How long do we remain restrictive?’” Among other challenges, it is tough to guess how American consumers, who drive about 70 percent of the economy, will behave next year. They are eking outincome gains even counting for inflation in recent months, and they are still sitting on savings amassed during the pandemic. That could help to keep them shopping into 2023. But at the same time, many families have been drawing down their extra funds and the nation’s savings rate — how much people tuck away out of their disposable income — has dipped to low levels. It is unclear how long people will be willing to spend out of their nest eggs before they begin to meaningfully pull back. The White House, for its part, has been welcoming any sign that the economy remains resilient at price increases fade. “There will be more ups and downs in the year ahead, but we are making progress building an economy from the bottom up and the middle out,” President Biden said in a release after the report on Friday. “I’m optimistic for the year ahead.” But as the Fed’s policy changes play out, many economists expect that the economy will lose momentum and eventually contract next year. Analysts at Capital Economics “continue to expect a mild recession next year,” Andrew Hunter, the firm’s senior U.S. economist, wrote in a research note on Friday. He noted that consumption was pulling back and that business investment was likely to “weaken more markedly next year as the full impact of the Fed’s aggressive tightening this year feeds through.”"
"7","Britain's Inflation Rate Dips to 10.7 Percent From a Four-Decade High","December 15, 2022 Thursday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 4",1015,"Eshe Nelson",NA,"The pace of price increases in November edged down from 11.1 percent. But households are still being squeezed as wages fail to keep up. Britain's inflation rate eased away from a 41-year high on Wednesday, but the slowdown brings only limited relief to a nation gripped by a deep cost-of-living crisis.    Consumer prices in Britain rose 10.7 percent in November from a year earlier, bringing the rate of inflation down slightly from 11.1 percent in October, which was the highest annual rate since 1981, the Office for National Statistics said.   Despite this tentative sign that inflation may have peaked, British households are being squeezed by high energy bills, food costs and mortgage rates, while wage growth is failing to keep up with inflation. Based on data that goes back to the mid-1950s, Britons are facing the sharpest decline in living standards on record over the next two years. That is prompting a growing wave of labor unrest. Railroad and postal workers are on strike on Wednesday over demands for higher pay, while nurses are set to walk off the job on Thursday.   On a monthly basis, prices rose 0.4 percent in November, easing the torrid pace of October when they climbed 2 percent in a single month because of higher energy costs, despite billions spent by the government to cap household gas and electric bills.   Core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices, slowed to an annual rate of 6.3 percent, from 6.5 percent in October. Economists had expected core inflation to hold steady, according to a survey by Bloomberg. A slowdown in transportation prices, particularly for fuel, as well as clothing and recreation services, all contributed to the lower overall inflation rate, while rising prices in restaurants and for groceries partially offset that. Food and drink prices climbed 16.4 percent in November from a year earlier.   As a whole, Wednesday's inflation data are ''undoubtedly welcome,'' Sandra Horsfield, an economist at Investec, wrote in a note. But ''at 10.7 percent consumer price inflation is still running well ahead of average income growth, causing pain that households can readily attest to.''   ''There is still a long way to go before the all-clear on inflation can be sounded,'' she added.   The deceleration in the overall inflation rate will be encouraging for Bank of England policymakers who have sharply raised interest rates to try to tamp down inflation. Inflation also slowed more than expected in the United States, data released on Tuesday showed.   But this isn't enough for central bankers to declare victory, as they target a 2 percent inflation rate. Policymakers want to ward against the risk that high inflation lingers for years to come. They are alert to how much businesses pass on price increases to customers and how much wages rise in response to the higher cost of living and a tight labor market.   Data published on Tuesday showed that average pay in Britain, excluding bonuses, rose an annual rate of 6.1 percent in the three months to October. Even though that's slower than the rate of inflation, policymakers argue that this pickup in wages is still too high to be sure inflation can sustainably return to target.    On Thursday, Bank of England policymakers are expected to raise interest rates for a ninth consecutive time, to 3.5 percent from 3 percent. The half-point increase would match the Federal Reserve's rate change on Wednesday and the expected increase by the European Central Bank on Thursday. All three central banks are expected to decelerate from previous increases in interest rates of three-quarters of a point.   Policymakers are expected to slow the pace of rate increases as they assess the impact of months of tighter monetary policy in damping economic demand to squash inflationary pressures. In Britain, the central bank's rising benchmark rate, which has climbed from 0.1 percent a year ago, has already led to a notable increase in mortgage rates, with millions of households facing sharp increases in payments next year, and house prices falling.   While the inflation outlook is uncertain, the Bank of England predicts that the rate of price increases will slow sharply from the middle of next year as past jumps in energy prices drop out of the annual calculations.   But the cost of high inflation won't fall away so quickly. The British economy is likely already in a recession that the central bank predicts to last all through next year. Household finances will be under ''significant pressure'' from below-inflation wage gains, higher mortgage costs and an expected increase in unemployment, according to a financial stability report by the Bank of England published on Tuesday.   The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, a nonprofit, said on Wednesday that more than seven million households were ''going without essentials,'' which meant they had reported going hungry or skipping meals or didn't have adequate clothing, based on a survey. Just under five million households were said to be in arrears on at least one household bill.   ''I know it is tough for many right now, but it is vital that we take the tough decisions needed to tackle inflation -- the No. 1 enemy that makes everyone poorer,'' Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said in a statement in response to the inflation data on Wednesday. ''If we make the wrong choices now, high prices will persist and prolong the pain for millions.''   This tough stance comes as government ministers have been embroiled in debates with unions over improving pay offers following a long history of below-inflation wages. Recently a large gulf has opened up between  pay growth in the private and public sectors. Before accounting for inflation, private-sector pay rose at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the three months to October, but just 2.7 percent for workers in the public sector, data published on Tuesday showed.   Pat Cullen, the chief executive of the Royal College of Nurses, the union whose members will go on strike on Thursday and again next week, accused the government of ''belligerence'' as talks broke down. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/business/economy/uk-inflation-prices.html  Graphic"
"8","Inflation Cooled Notably in November, Good News for the Fed","December 13, 2022 Tuesday 15:15 EST","BUSINESS; economy",1350,"Jeanna Smialek","Consumer Price Index data reinforces that inflation is beginning to slow down just ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December rate decision.","Consumer Price Index data reinforces that inflation is beginning to slow down just ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December rate decision. Inflation slowed more sharply than expected in November, an encouraging sign for both Federal Reserve officials and consumers that 18 months of rapid and unrelenting price increases are beginning to meaningfully abate. The new data is unlikely to alter the Fed’s plan to raise interest rates by another half point at the conclusion of its two-day meeting on Wednesday.  But the moderation in inflation, which affected used cars, some types of food and airline tickets, caused investors to speculate that the Fed could pursue a less aggressive policy path next year — potentially increasing the chances of a “soft landing,” or one in which the economy slows gradually and without a painful recession. Stock prices jumped sharply after government data showed that inflation eased to 7.1 percent in the year through November, down from 7.7 percent in the previous reading and less than economists had expected. The Fed, which has been rapidly raising rates in three-quarter point increments, is expected to make a smaller move on Wednesday, bringing rates to a range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent. Central bankers will also release economic projections showing how much they expect to raise interest rates next year, and investors are now betting that they will slow to quarter-point adjustments by their February meeting as fading price pressures give them latitude to proceed more cautiously. “The overall picture is definitely improving,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “It’s unambiguously good news, but it would not be fair to say that inflation is falling everywhere — there are still pockets of big increases.” While price increases are not yet slowing across the board, they are moderating for key goods and services that consumers buy every day, including gas and meat. That is good news for President Biden, who has struggled to convince Americans that the economy is strong as the surging cost of living erodes voter confidence. “Inflation is coming down in America,” Mr. Biden said during remarks at the White House on Tuesday morning. He hailed the report as “news that provides some optimism for the holiday season, and I would argue, the year ahead.” Still, he cautioned that the nation could face more setbacks in its efforts to bring inflation under control. “We shouldn’t take anything for granted,” he said. Inflation remains unusually rapid for now: Tuesday’s 7.1 percent reading is an improvement, but it is still much faster than the roughly 2 percent that prevailed before the pandemic. The details of the report suggested that further cooling is likely in store. Many of the categories in which price increases are now slowing are tied more to the pandemic and supply chains than to Fed policy. For instance, food and fuel price jumps are moderating after climbing rapidly earlier this year, an effect of transportation issues and fallout from the war in Ukraine. Used car prices, which were severely elevated by a collision of consumer demand and parts shortages, are now falling sharply. Officials are “getting the help that they expected” from healing supply chains and cheaper goods, said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Bank of America. The question now is what will happen with inflation in service categories, which can be more stubborn and difficult to cool. The Fed has lifted interest rates from just above zero early this year to about 4 percent — and those higher borrowing costs are now trickling through the economy to cool both consumer demand and the labor market. That should slow down many types of inflation in 2023. For instance, used car prices are likely to continue to decline as car loans become so pricey that would-be buyers are squeezed out of the market. Wage growth remains rapid now, but as businesses hold off on expansions or lay off workers, it is expected to slow, which could help price changes for many kinds of services to slow down. Already, market-based rent increases have pulled back sharply, which should trickle into inflation data over the next year. Rents were 7.9 percent higher than a year earlier in November, the fastest year-over-year increase in four decades, as tenants renew their leases after a big pop in market rent prices in 2021 and early 2022. That is poised to slow down notably in the coming months. The Consumer Price Index figures released on Tuesday are closely watched because they are the first major inflation data points to come out each month. The Fed officially targets a more delayed measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, and aims for 2 percent on average over time. That measure came in at 6 percent in the year through October. As price increases begin to moderate notably, investors and households alike are wondering how high the Fed is likely to raise interest rates in 2023 — and how long officials will leave borrowing costs elevated. One camp argues that the central bank should be cautious, avoiding doing too much and causing a recession at a time when price increases are already on their way back toward normal. But other economists and policymakers contend that underlying inflation pressures remain. They warn that the Fed needs to stick with the program to ensure that inflation does not become a permanent feature of the American economy. Services inflation contributed about 3.9 percentage points of November’s inflation reading. Much of that comes from the rapid increase in rents that is poised to taper off, but some is from a tick-up in other categories, such as garbage collection, dentist visits and tickets to sports games.  “Although the long awaited moderation in goods categories is finally underway, the underlying pace of inflation still looks inconsistent with the Fed’s target,” Tiffany Wilding, North American economist at PIMCO, wrote in a note following the inflation release. If price increases remained stubbornly higher for years on end, they could begin to feed on themselves, with consumers asking for bigger raises to keep up and companies instituting bigger or more frequent price adjustments to cover rising labor bills. That sort of self-fulfilling cycle is exactly what the Fed is trying to avoid. In the 1970s, officials allowed inflation to remain slightly more rapid than usual for years on end, which created what economists since have called an “inflationary psychology.” When oil prices spiked for geopolitical reasons, an already elevated inflation base and high inflation expectations helped price increases climb drastically. Fed policymakers ultimately raised rates to nearly 20 percentand pushed unemployment to double digits to bring price moves back under control. Central bankers today want to avoid a rerun of that painful experience. For now, they have signaled that they expect to raise interest rates slightly in early 2023, then leave them at high levels for some time to constrain the economy. “It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech late last month. “We will stay the course until the job is done.” Ms. Wilding said she expected the labor market to slow down notably in early 2023, allowing the Fed to stop raising interest rates, as did Mr. Shepherdson at Pantheon. “I think that they are going to be done in February,” he said. But he expects rates to remain at a relatively high rate — just shy of 5 percent — for a long time, as the Fed avoids letting up too soon and allowing inflation to stage a comeback. “They’re going to be very cautious: They’ve had their fingers burned.” Ben Casselman, Jim Tankersley and Lydia DePillis contributed reporting."

Next year could be better — but there’s ample room for humility.","Economists misjudged how much staying power inflation would have. Next year could be better — but there’s ample room for humility. At this time last year, economists were predicting that inflation would swiftly fade in 2022 as supply chain issues cleared, consumers shifted from goods to services spending and pandemic relief waned. They are now forecasting the same thing for 2023, citing many of the same reasons. But as consumers know, predictions of a big inflation moderation this year were wrong. While price increases have started to slow slightly, they are still hovering near four-decade highs. Economists expect fresh data scheduled for release on Tuesday to show that the Consumer Price Index climbed by 7.3 percent in the year through November.  That raises the question: Should America believe this round of inflation optimism? “There is better reason to believe that inflation will fall this year than last year,” said Jason Furman, an economist from Harvard who was skeptical of last year’s forecasts for a quick return to normal. Still, “if you pocket all the good news and ignore the countervailing bad news, that’s a mistake.” Economists are slightly less optimistic than last year. Economists see inflation fading notably in the months ahead, but after a year of foiled expectations, they aren’t penciling in quite as drastic a decline as they were last December. The Fed officially targets the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which is related to the consumer price measure. Officials particularly watch a version of the number that illustrates underlying inflation trends by stripping out volatile food and fuel prices — so those forecasts give the best snapshot of what experts are anticipating. Last year, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected that so-called core index to fall to 2.5 percent by the end of 2022. Instead, it is running at 5 percent, twice that pace. This year, forecasters expect inflation to fade to 3 percent by the end of 2023. The Federal Reserve’s predictions have followed a similar pattern. As of last December, central bankers expected core inflation to end 2022 at 2.7 percent. Their September projections showed price increases easing to 3.1 percent by the end of next year. Fed officials will release a new set of inflation forecasts for 2023 on Wednesday following their December policy meeting. Supply chains are healing. One reason to think that the anticipated but elusive inflation slowdown will finally show up in 2023 ties back to supply chains. At this time last year,economists were hopeful that snarls in global shipping and manufacturing would soon clear; consumer spending would shift away from goods and back to services; and the combination would allow supply and demand to come back into balance, slowing price increases on everything from cars to couches. That has happened, but only gradually. It has also taken longer to translate into lower consumer prices than some economists had expected. But the expected shift is finally, if belatedly, showing up. After months of supply chain healing, consumers are now beginning to feel the benefit. Used car prices began declining meaningfully in October inflation data, furniture prices are slumping and apparel is falling in price. Similar cost declines are expected to weigh on inflation next year. “It is far too early to declare goods inflation vanquished, but if current trends continue, goods prices should begin to exert downward pressure on overall inflation in coming months,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a recent speech. The Fed is working on cooling demand. Unfortunately, moderation in goods prices alone would probably fail to return America to a normal inflation rate, because price increases for services have been accelerating. That category — which covers everything from meals out to monthly rent — accounted for half of consumer price inflation in October, based on a Bloomberg breakdown, up from less than a third a year earlier. Many types of service inflation are closely intertwined with what’s happening in the job market. For companies including hair salons, restaurant chains and tax accountants, paying employees is typically a major, if not the biggest, cost of doing business. When workers are scarce and wages are climbing rapidly, businesses are more likely to raise their prices to try to cover heftier labor bills. That means that today’s very low unemployment and abnormally rapid wage growth could help to keep price increases faster than usual, even though the job market wasn’t a big driver of the initial burst in inflation. That is where Fed policy could come in. Companies can only charge more if their customers are able — and willing — to pay more. The Fed can stop that chain reaction by lifting interest rates to slow demand. Policymakers have raised interest rates from near-zero at the start of 2022 to nearly 4 percent, and are expected to make another interest rate increase this week. Those moves have made it more expensive to borrow money to buy a house, finance a big purchase or expand a business. The knock-on effects are now trickling through the economy: Fewer house sales could eventually mean less hiring in construction and manufacturing, which in turn would mean less spending in the local economies where would-be builders and factory workers live. As the job market slows down and wage growth moderates, demand is expected to weaken for everything from dinners out to air travel. “Slower wage growth will reduce upward pressure on services inflation,” economists at Goldman Sachs predicted. But the process might take time. They expect the labor market for health care workers in particular to remain hot and put upward pressure on inflation next year, for instance. Rent growth is moderating. In one service category, though, a 2023 inflation deceleration is a fairly sure bet: rents. Rent increases take time to flow into measured inflation because existing tenants do not start paying more until they renew their leases. That means that a 2021 pop in new rents has been slowly working its way into the official price numbers, pushing up inflation throughout 2022. Market-based rents have begun to cool or even fall in recent months, which suggests that rent growth should also begin to moderate. The uncertainty is when the slowdown will happen — some economists think as early as next spring — and how quickly rents will decelerate. But big wild cards remain. The challenge with forecasting inflation is that while it is possible to make guesses about specific categories like rent, many inflation drivers come as a surprise. Forecasters in 2021 could not have guessed that Russia would invade Ukraine in early 2022, sharply pushing up food and fuel prices. Likewise, it is hard to guess what will happen on the geopolitical stage next year. An escalation of the conflict in Europe could put renewed pressure on gas prices. The return of Chinese consumers after years of rolling lockdowns could lead to more people competing for goods in the global market. And things could simply take longer than expected to return to normal. That’s partly what happened in 2022. Consumption and the labor market both outstripped expectations, keeping the pressure on prices. “The economy was more resilient than expected,” said Laura Rosner-Warburton, senior economist at Macro Policy Perspectives. “Supply chain problems lasted a lot longer than expected and have been difficult to forecast on the way up and down.” How quickly demand will slow is still uncertain. The labor market is expected to cool, but for now it is strong. And many households are still in solid financial shape. They amassed $2.3 trillion in extra savings during the pandemic thanks to months stuck at home and government stimulus, and still had about $1.7 trillion of that by mid-2022, based onFed research. Those nest eggs have helped Americans to sustain their spending this year, giving companies the ability to raise prices without scaring away customers — a trend that could continue, at least for a while. The challenge in forecasting, Mr. Furman said, is that there’s “a powerful desire to tell a happy story.” So far, inflation has been anything but."

The Bank of England raised interest rates by half a percentage point on Thursday, moderating the pace of increases while Britain braces for a prolonged recession with inflation eating away at household budgets. The central bank predicted that the British economy is already in a recession and that inflation has peaked. Consumer prices rose 10.7 percent in November from a year earlier, data published on Wednesday showed. That was down slightly from 11.1 percent in October, the highest annual rate since 1981. Even as Britain faces a challenging economic outlook, most of the bank’s nine-person rate-setting committee said that they expected more increases in interest rates will be needed to bring inflation back to the bank’s 2 percent target. The Bank of England started raising rates a year ago and over the course of nine consecutive policy meetings the bank has lifted rates from 0.1 percent to 3.5 percent, the highest since 2008. In November, it increased rates by three-quarters of a point. “There were considerable uncertainties” around the economic outlook, according to the minutes of the bank’s meeting. “If the outlook suggested more persistent inflationary pressures” the committee that sets interest rates would “respond forcefully.” Higher energy prices, especially since Russia’s war in Ukraine began earlier this year, have been heavily responsibly for the sharp increase in inflation in Britain. But the central bank has grown more concerned at the extent to which high prices have seeped into the British economy, with service businesses setting higher prices and wages rising quickly. The bank said that the labor market remained tight and inflationary pressures in the British economy could make large price increases more persistent, as it continued to raise interest rates despite the grim economic outlook. In particular, service price inflation and wage growth in the private sector have been rising faster than the central bank expected. Before adjusting for inflation, private-sector pay rose at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the three months to October, data published on Tuesday showed. “Inflation may be coming down but it would be premature” for the Bank of England “to claim victory in the fight over inflation,” Karen Ward, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a note. She added that she expects the bank to raise rates by at least another percentage point before stopping, arguing that the bank “needs to be extremely vigilant that a new high-inflation mentality does not take hold.”  The bank’s decision came a day after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by half a percentage point, but the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, said that rates would climb higher than previously expected next year as inflation proves difficult to temper. Later on Thursday, the European Central Bank is expected to follow both the Fed and Bank of England in moderating its pace of rate increases to half a point, from three-quarters of a point. But as the British economy slows and households contend with the highest food price inflation in more than four decades, combined with a jump in mortgage costs and higher energy bills, two members of the Bank of England’s committee voted to hold rates steady at this meeting. They said higher interest rates were already tightening financial conditions, and cited the weakness in the economy from incomes lagging far behind inflation. “The lags in the effects of monetary policy meant that sizable impacts from past rate increases were still to come through,” Silvana Tenreyro and Swati Dhingra argued, according to the minutes of this week’s meeting, and so further interest rate increases weren’t needed for inflation to return to target. It was the first time since March that any committee members had voted to keep rates on hold. The central bank’s forecasts show that the British economy is already in a recession, albeit a shallow one, with growth falling slightly this quarter after a 0.2 percent decline from July to September. But the divergence in opinion was wide. One member of the committee, Catherine L. Mann, voted for another three-quarter-point increase, arguing that wage pressures would stay strong for longer than previously thought, and the bank should lean against “an inflation psychology” that was pushing up expectations of further price increases. Since the central bank’s last meeting, the government announceda 55 billion pound ($68 billion) plan for higher taxes and spending cuts. Last month,  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his top finance minister, Jeremy Hunt, said the measures were necessary as part of their efforts to bring down the nation’s debt and restore fiscal credibility after the short and turbulent premiership of Liz Truss. The measures are expected to add 0.4 percent to gross domestic product over the first year, but have almost no impact on economic growth in the following year and shrink the economy in the third year as the spending cuts and tax increases start to bite, the bank forecast. The overall impact of these measures on inflation is expected to be small, it added."
"12","Cooling inflation is a welcome sign for President Biden.","December 13, 2022 Tuesday 11:57 EST","BUSINESS",527,"Jim Tankersley","The administration has begun to promote slowing price growth, viewing it as validation of Biden’s economic policies.","The administration has begun to promote slowing price growth, viewing it as validation of Biden’s economic policies. President Biden celebrated Tuesday’s report that price growth slowed more than expected in November, viewing the news as validation of his economic policies even as still-high inflation hits holiday shoppers. “Inflation is coming down in America,” Mr. Biden said in remarks on Tuesday morning at the White House. He hailed the report as “news that provides some optimism for the holiday season, and I would argue, the year ahead.” Mr. Biden cautioned that prices were still too high and that the nation might still face setbacks in its efforts to bring inflation under control. “We shouldn’t take anything for granted,” he said. “But what is clear, is my economic plan is working, and we’re just getting started.” The president and his aides have begun to promote progress in the fight against stubborn inflation, more so than officials at the Federal Reserve, who are responsible for keeping price growth in check. “Americans are beginning to see a much-needed break in inflation,” Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, told reporters last week, “but we have more work to do.” Administration officials have repeatedly cited progress in unclogging global supply chains to relieve backlogs that pushed up the price of goods like furniture and appliances in recent years. And they have trumpeted declines in gasoline prices, which jumped amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and topped $5 a gallon nationally this summer. “Gas prices have hit their lowest levels since January,” Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, wrote in a memo to reporters last weekend. “The national average is below $3.30 per gallon — down roughly 50 cents in the past 30 days, more than $1.70 since June and about 25 cents below the average when Putin invaded Ukraine. That decline is saving American families with two cars about $175 per month.” The continued cheering brings risks. Since inflation began to climb shortly after Mr. Biden took office, administration officials have frequently predicted those increases would not last long — only to be proven wrong by new data. Officials believe that this time is different. Along with supply chain improvements, they point to the continued drag on growth from the Fed’s interest rate increases and from a shrinking federal deficit. Less government borrowing means less consumer demand in the economy, which can serve as a brake on price growth. After his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Biden was asked by a reporter when he expects prices to return to normal. “I hope by the end of next year, we’re much closer,” Mr. Biden said. “But I can’t make that prediction.” Republicans essentially ignored the faster-than-expected fall in inflation on Tuesday, instead using the new report to again attack Mr. Biden for rising prices on his watch. “Thanks to the spike in prices brought on by the Biden administration and congressional Democrats’ reckless spending,” Representative Jason Smith of Missouri, the top Republican on the budget committee, said in a news release, “Americans are bracing for a blue Christmas.”"
"13","Russia keeps its key interest rate steady amid worries of inflation.","December 16, 2022 Friday 23:43 EST","WORLD; europe",771,"Ivan Nechepurenko","The country’s central bank said inflation, at 12 percent, risked rising because of a growing budget deficit.","The country’s central bank said inflation, at 12 percent, risked rising because of a growing budget deficit. Russia’s central bank kept its key interest rate at 7.5 percent on Friday, citing risks of increased inflation and restrained consumer demand as economists warned that the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions were continuing to sap productivity. The Bank of Russia said in a statement that “the external conditions for the Russian economy remain complicated and significantly limit economic activity.” It said consumer prices rose at annual rate of 12 percent last month, pushed by a tight labor market that was accelerating wage growth. The Russian economy has come under severe international sanctions in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but it has defied expectations of a collapse unseen since the painful post-Soviet transformation in early 1990s. On Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin radiated confidence at a meeting with top government ministers in which he said the Russian economy would contract 2.5 percent this year, which is somewhat more optimistic than the International Monetary Fund’s estimate of a 3.5-percent shrinkage. Accusing the West of waging “an economic war” against Moscow and praising his government’s “responsible financial policy,” Mr. Putin said the country’s economy had avoided an outright collapse. Still, some Russian economists predicted that the worst is yet to come. Yevgeny Nadorshin, the chief economist at the PF Capital consulting company in Moscow, warned that the Russian economy could now enter a deeper downturn that cannot be cushioned by increased government spending as before. The mobilization of recruits to help fight in Ukraine, and an exodus of  some highly skilled upper-middle-class  workers, would have a negative effect on  productivity, he said. In addition, the government’s increased focus on military spending will make the economy less productive. “We are doomed to deal with a tough deficit of highly effective labor while sanctions limit our way to compensate for this in terms of imports of high-end technology,” Mr. Nadorshin said in a telephone interview. In late February, after Mr. Putin’s decision to send troops to Ukraine, inflation surged in Russia, and the central bank more than doubled its benchmark interest rate, to 20 percent. Since then, it has cut the rate six times as inflation has eased and the bank tried to stimulate an economy dealing with increased isolation. The central bank projected that annual inflation would decline to as low as 5 percent in 2023 and 4 percent in 2024. Dmitri Polevoy, the chief strategist at Locko Invest, an asset management company in Moscow, said that sanctions would have a prolonged effect on Russia’s economy and that it was no longer important how much it will contract this year. “What is interesting is how much deeper will the contraction be next year than what the government expects,” he said, noting that the widening budget deficit was turning into “the main headache” for the central bank. Indeed, the Bank of Russia said Friday that the budget deficit might force it tighten its policy  to control inflation. For years, the Russian economy, and its tax revenues, relied on a huge exports of fossil fuels. But the country’s energy industry has been upended by the war in Ukraine, most recently by a European Union embargo on Russian oil and the Group of 7’s price cap on Russian crude, both of which took effect Dec. 5. Last week, Russia’s finance minister said the country’s budget deficit will reach 2 percent of economic output this year, up from earlier predictions of 0.9 percent, according to TASS, a state news agency. The central bank noted that unemployment in Russia had dropped to a record low, partly because the mobilization of troops to join fighting in Ukraine had reduced the supply of available workers. In its Friday statement, the central bank warned that the conscription effort had forced employers to increase salaries. Outside Russia, the effects of the war in Ukraine have manifested in soaring energy and food prices, pushing inflation in Europe, the United States and elsewhere far above levels that policymakers try to maintain. This week, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England all raised interest rates and pledged to continue tightening their policies until stubbornly high inflation came under control, even as their economies show signs of slowing, if not outright recession."
"14","The slowdown in inflation was driven by food, energy and used vehicles.","December 13, 2022 Tuesday 10:23 EST","BUSINESS",401,"Lydia DePillis","Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 6 percent over the year, an indication that price increases are slowing broadly.","Core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, slowed to 6 percent over the year, an indication that price increases are slowing broadly. A rise in food prices, which had been propelling rapid inflation for more than a year, appears to be cooling off. Although food overall is 10.6 percent more expensive than it was at this time last year, items like meat dropped in price over the past month, and food served at restaurants rose less quickly than it has over the past quarter. Energy prices continued to fall in November, partially as a result of the Covid-related lockdowns in China, which decreased demand. (Those lockdowns have recently been eased.) The cost of gas used to heat homes fell for the second straight month, while fuel oil — which is more prevalent in New England — continued to rise slightly, and is up 65.7 percent over the year. Critically for the Federal Reserve, core inflation — which strips out volatile food and energy — is decelerating, to 6 percent over the year. That’s an indication that price increases are slowing broadly. The original item to skyrocket in price, used cars, is definitively rolling over as auto manufacturing has ramped up and strained consumers begin to push back. Prices in the new car market stalled out, but have yet to fall. The cost of rent continues to drive overall inflation, though the Labor Department’s measure is backward-looking; more current indicators have shown new leases dropping sharply in some markets. Owners’ equivalent rent, which tracks elements such as insurance, mortgage interest and overall home prices, hasdecelerated only slightly in recent months despite rapidly rising interest rates. Prices for medical care services, which had been accelerating as patients started to come back for their normal procedures after the pandemic, dropped for the second month in a row. Flight fares continued to fall going into the holidays as airlines managed to add planes and fuel prices eased. And if you’re out holiday shopping, books and toys would be good options, as they’ve both been dropping in price for several months (but remain solidly above 2019 levels). Electronics might be even better, as they’re back to prepandemic prices."

The S&P 500 fell 1.8 percent, its third straight drop. The slide more than offset the index's gains last week. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 1.4 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite slid 1.9 percent. Small-company stocks fell even more, sending the Russell 2000 index 2.8 percent lower.    Bond yields mostly climbed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.60 percent from 3.49 percent late Friday.   The selling came as traders reacted to some better-than-expected economic snapshots. The services sector, which makes up the biggest part of the U.S. economy, showed surprising growth in November, according to the Institute for Supply Management. Reports on business orders at U.S. factories and orders for durable goods in October also rose more than expected.   The reports are positive for the broader economy, but they make the Fed's fight against inflation more difficult because it likely means the central bank will have to keep raising interest rates in order to bring down inflation.   ''It's more of that 'good news is bad news,''' said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. The latest economic data ''bolsters the idea that rates are going to be higher.''   Meanwhile, China is lifting some of its most severe Covid-19 restrictions following protests across major cities. That has raised hopes that disruptions to manufacturing and trade will ease.   The S&P 500 fell 72.86 points to 3,998.84. The Dow dropped 482.78 points to 33,947.10. The Nasdaq slid 221.56 points to 11,239.94. The Russell 2000 fell 52.62 points to 1,840.22.   All told, roughly 95 percent of the stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index were in the red, with technology companies, banks and retailers among the biggest weights on the market. Chip maker Nvidia fell 1.6 percent, Bank of America slid 4.5 percent and Amazon dropped 3.3 percent.   V.F. Corp., which makes Vans shoes and The North Face outdoor gear, slid 11.2 percent for the biggest drop in the S&P 500 after warning investors that weak demand is crimping revenue. The company also announced the departure of its C.E.O.   Tesla fell 6.4 percent following reports that it may have to cut production in China because of weak demand.   Markets in Asia rose, while markets in Europe closed mostly lower.   Inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for recessions throughout global economies are among the biggest concerns for investors. Wall Street has been closely watching corporate announcements and government reports to get a better sense of just how much damage is being done to the economy, as well as inflation's path ahead in 2023.   Investors are also weighing several international developments that could further unsettle a global economy that is already getting burned by stubbornly hot inflation. Russia's ongoing invasion of Ukraine continues agitating an already volatile global energy market. U.S. crude oil prices bounced around before settling 3.8 percent lower after a group of world leaders agreed to a boycott of most Russian oil. They also committed to a price cap of $60 per barrel on Russian exports.   Oil and gas company stocks fell amid a broad pullback in energy prices, including an 11.2 percent slump in natural gas. Exxon Mobil fell 2.7 percent.   Investors are dealing with several crosscurrents of information. Demand may be weakening in some areas of the economy, but some sectors remain resilient. Employment remains a strong area of the economy as does overall consumer spending.  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."
"16","Fed's Preferred Price Gauge Signals Slowing of Inflation","December 2, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1266,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"A measure of inflation that the Federal Reserve watches most closely is showing signs of moderation, though price gains still remain too fast for comfort. Inflation showed welcome signs of slowing in October, but it remained uncomfortably rapid even as a spate of economic data underscored that a return to normal price increases could take time.    Prices measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the measure the Federal Reserve watches most closely, climbed 6 percent over the year through October, the report showed, in line with what economists in a Bloomberg survey had expected. That was down from a 6.3 percent increase over the year through September.   A core price measure that strips out food and fuel costs, one that the Fed watches closely for a sign of what might come next with inflation, eased slightly to 5 percent. It has been hovering around that level throughout the year, so while the recent moderation is a step in the right direction, it is not conclusive.   Other economic data provided fresh evidence of continued economic momentum. Consumer spending was accelerating, incomes were rising and jobless claims stayed muted, reports on Thursday showed, suggesting that the economy remains resilient as workers benefit from plentiful jobs and use their savings to continue shopping. Sustained demand and a solid labor market could help to prevent an abrupt recession -- but they could also help companies to continue raising prices, prolonging the journey back to normal inflation.   The Fed is closely watching how inflation evolves as it tries to determine how high to raise interest rates and how long to keep them elevated. Central bankers have raised borrowing costs to nearly 4 percent this year from near zero in March, including a rapid series of three-quarter-point moves. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, signaled clearly on Wednesday that central bankers are poised to slow their rate increases in December. The question now is when, and at what level, they will stop raising borrowing costs.   Mr. Powell suggested that rates would probably need to climb slightly higher than the 4.6 percent peak that officials anticipated in September, when they last released economic forecasts. Investors now see rates peaking between 4.75 percent and 5 percent before coming down slightly late in 2023, based on market pricing.   ''Ongoing increases will be appropriate,'' Mr. Powell said this week. ''We have a long way to go in restoring price stability.''   Thursday's inflation data followed a more timely Consumer Price Index report, which showed price increases starting to moderate in October. The C.P.I. data are closely tracked because they come out more promptly and feed into the Personal Consumption Expenditures data. But the Fed uses the P.C.E. figures as its official inflation target.   Central bankers aim for 2 percent annual inflation on average and over time, so the current pace is still far faster than their goal. Given that so-called core inflation has been stuck around 5 percent all year, the Fed has been hesitant to make much of the recent cool-down in overall prices.   ''Over 2022, core inflation rose a few tenths above 5 percent and fell a few tenths below, but it mainly moved sideways,'' Mr. Powell said this week, explaining that demand will need to remain slower, goods inflation will need to continue easing and the labor market will need to come back into balance to return inflation to normal.   John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with Fox Business on Thursday that the Fed had ''a ways to go'' in raising interest rates, but that there were good signs that ''inflation is turning.''   ''We're moving now, and into next year, with a lower inflationary trend,'' Mr. Williams said.   Many economists think that inflation will meaningfully decelerate in 2023, because market-based rent prices are beginning to cool, supply chain problems have eased and consumers have been shifting their spending away from goods and toward services, which should help prices for physical products like couches and clothing to moderate.   Goldman Sachs economists said in their forecast in mid-November that inflation is likely to fall to about 3 percent by the end of 2023, after food and fuel prices are stripped out. But last year at this time, they said they expected core inflation to fall to 2.3 percent by the end of 2022.   ''Forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year, while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways,'' Mr. Powell said this week. He later added that ''we're going to have to be humble and skeptical about forecasts for some time.''   It is difficult to predict what will happen next with inflation in part because the economy, which had slowed meaningfully this year, seems to be resilient and possibly even re-accelerating in the face of higher prices and interest rates.   Consumption climbed 0.8 percent in October from the prior month, Thursday's data showed, up from a previous gain of 0.6 percent. Adjusted for inflation, spending climbed 0.5 percent.   More recent anecdotal data suggest that the holiday shopping season is off to a strong start: Retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend were up 10.9 percent from the prior year, excluding cars and not adjusting for inflation, based on Mastercard data.   Americans are being buoyed in part by a strong labor market that is helping them to take home more money, and by one-time payments from states, some of which have stimulus money left to disburse or are benefiting from strong tax receipts.   Personal income rose 0.7 percent in October, and 0.4 percent after adjusting for inflation, Thursday's data showed. That was the biggest inflation-adjusted increase since July.   Personal income includes government social benefits, which helped to boost it this time, ''primarily reflecting one-time refundable tax credits issued by states,'' the Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its release.   At the same time, people seem to be growing more price sensitive as their savings run down and expensive food and gas weigh on family budgets. Stores have begun to discount products again to lure and retain customers, which could help to reduce inflation, if it is drastic enough.   Consumers could become even more sensitive next year if the policy moves that the Fed has made in 2022 trickle through the economy and temper business expansions, hiring and pay gains, as many economists expect, and as households draw down the savings stockpiles they amassed during the pandemic.   ''We expect spending growth to slow, on the back of a material increase in the pace of layoffs and a slowdown in hiring,'' Ian Shepherdson at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote in a research note. ''We think people will be less willing to run down savings in the face of a deteriorating labor market.''   Fed officials are watching both spending data and the employment situation as they try to guess what might come next with inflation. Wage growth has been strong in recent months, and it could be hard for inflation to moderate the whole way back to normal without slower pay growth.   That is because services prices -- those for haircuts, manicures, vacations and the like -- are heavily driven by pay gains. When companies are spending more on labor, they are likely to try to pass those higher costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices.   America will get a fresh look at how both the job market and the wage situation are shaping up on Friday, when the Labor Department is set to release November employment data. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/business/inflation-federal-reserve.html  Graphic"

"18","Wonking Out: When Should We Declare Victory Over Inflation?; Paul Krugman","December 2, 2022 Friday 15:26 EST","OPINION",1027,"Paul Krugman","The case for 3 percent (as opposed to 2) gets real.","Put on your statistical noise-canceling headphones, and the sound you hear is that of falling underlying inflation. Even Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said in effect as much in his speech Wednesday. It’s not happening yet, but in the not-too-distant future we’ll probably see inflation fall enough that we’ll have to make some hard decisions about when to declare victory. About Powell’s speech: I was especially gratified to see him noting that market rents have been moderating fast, a development that will predictably lead to a falloff in official shelter inflation — which in turn plays a huge role in standard measures of underlying inflation — some time next year. Unfortunately, the chart he presented showed changes over the past year, which is too long a stretch: The big falloff in rents has taken place just over the past few months. For example, here’s rent data from Apartment List: Rents normally decline in the fall, but the recent decline was much bigger than seasonal factors alone can explain. So one main component of inflation is set to come way down. And already, if we use market rents instead of the official shelter measure, which lags rents by many months, we get “core” inflation of less than 3 percent recently. But I wouldn’t go to the wall for that estimate on its own. I was less happy with Powell’s suggestion that we should focus on the rate of inflation in services other than housing, and his further assertion that this category largely reflects wages. For one thing, this index is narrow enough that it’s affected a lot by quirky items like the price of “portfolio management and investment advice services” that aren’t well measured. And it’s not clear that it’s really driven by wages, either. On the other hand, I have increasingly been turning to wages as a measure of underlying inflation. That’s not because I think greedy workers are driving inflation — they clearly aren’t. But wage growth is probably a pretty good indicator of how hot or cold the overall economy is running (and you can’t have a wage-price spiral without spiraling wages). Unfortunately, this morning’s employment report was bad news on that front. Until this morning, it looked as if wages were slowing, but some of the old data have been revised up and the latest number was high. So a big decline in inflation may be a way off. Still, underlying inflation will probably come down reasonably soon, although it will be above the Fed’s target of 2 percent inflation. But is that the right target? How much pain should we be willing to suffer to squeeze inflation down to that point? As it happens, a number of economists, myself included, have long argued that the 2 percent target is too low. This isn’t a radical position; many of the advocates of a 3 or even 4 percent target are as mainstream as they get. Recently, Olivier Blanchard, the former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, made the case for 3 in The Financial Times. To understand the argument, you need to know why the conventional inflation target is 2 percent rather than zero. The answer is that many economists believe that a little bit of inflation helps to “lubricate” the economy in at least two ways. For one thing, an economy with 2 percent inflation will normally have somewhat higher interest rates than an economy with zero inflation. This gives the Fed more room to cut rates in the face of a slump, making recession-fighting more effective. For another, an ever-changing economy often requires that prices of some goods (and wages for some workers) fall relative to prices and wages elsewhere. But price and wage cuts are hard to achieve. If the price of widgets needs to fall relative to the price of gizmos, it’s easier to do this with rising gizmo prices rather than falling widget prices, so adjustment is easier if overall inflation is somewhat positive. On the other hand, there’s a lot to be said for more or less stable prices, and in particular for an inflation rate low enough that people don’t have to think about it much. So how did 2 percent emerge as the norm? I wrote about this a few years back. Basically, 2 percent seemed to be a happy compromise: it was low enough that advocates of price stability could argue that it was “really” zero given quality improvements, but models suggested that it would be high enough to provide most of the lubricating benefits of modest inflation. And as more and more central banks adopted the 2 percent target, it came to have the force of tradition. But the economic events of the past 15 years, from the 2008 financial crisis to the Covid pandemic, have shown us that the economy is subject to more shocks than we thought — and that it requires more lubrication as a result. Situations in which even a zero interest rate isn’t enough to generate full employment, which were supposed to be very rare with 2 percent inflation, have turned out to be all too common: The financial crisis would have been easier to deal with if we’d come into it with 4 percent inflation, the rate during Ronald Reagan’s second term. And the huge changes the pandemic has wrought in how we work and what we buy have shown that the problems of adjustment are even bigger than we thought, and these problems might be easier to deal with if we accepted 3 or even 4 percent inflation rather than insisting that we get it down to 2. Now, Federal Reserve officials really, really don’t want to talk about this. They believe that any explicit statement to the effect that 2 percent is no longer the target would damage their credibility. I understand that. But the rest of us don’t have that problem. And in the months ahead we may well face a choice between imposing a recession to get inflation back down to a largely arbitrary target, which we wouldn’t have chosen 20 years ago if we’d known then what we know now, and declaring victory with inflation fairly low but not quite that low. I’m with Blanchard and others in believing that it’s OK to stop at 3, maybe without admitting that we’re doing it. But the question remains: What will policymakers do?"
"19","As Energy Prices Ease, a Wary Eurozone Sees Inflation Slow","December 1, 2022 Thursday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 6",945,"Melissa Eddy",NA,"Consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 10 percent in November, down from 10.6 percent a month earlier, the first moderation in 18 months. Easing energy prices helped lower the annual rate of inflation in the eurozone in November, the first slowdown in a year and a half. But policymakers cautioned that the worst may not yet be over.    Consumer prices in the 19 countries that use the euro as their currency rose at an annual rate of 10 percent in November, the European Commission reported on Wednesday. In October, the rate reached a record 10.6 percent. Twelve months ago, it was 4.9 percent.   After months of soaring from one high to the next, energy prices showed signs of slowing, as stocks of natural gas across the European Union stayed unseasonably high and temperatures mild.   Although it remained the strongest driver behind eurozone inflation, the annual increase in the price of energy was 34.9 percent in November, down from 41.5 percent a month earlier. The price of food, however, climbed slightly, to 13.6 percent over the year through November.   Overall, the so-called core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy, was steady at 5 percent. The ''stickiness'' of this rate is expected to weigh on policymakers when they hold their final meeting of the year next month.   Economists said that while the November data signaled a reverse after months of climbing consumer prices for Europe's common currency bloc,  the situation remained precarious.   ''Whether this is the peak in inflation remains to be seen,'' Bert Colijn, an economist with ING, said in a research note. ''Another episode in the energy crisis could easily push inflation back up again, and core inflation usually proves to be sticky after a supply shock.''   In Europe's largest economy, Germany (11.3 percent, down from 11.6), and in Spain (6.6 percent, down from 7.3), annual inflation rates cooled in November, thanks to easing energy prices. Consumer prices in France, the currency bloc's second-largest economy, rose 7.1 percent from a year earlier, matching October's increase. Baltic countries, which remain heavily dependent on natural gas, continued to have the bloc's highest rates of inflation, topped by Latvia at 21.7 percent.   Such divergences among eurozone countries are a challenge for policymakers and are expected to lead to lively debates on how best to handle the situation. With inflation  still well above the 2 percent targeted by the European Central Bank, some policymakers are warning that it is too early for the bank to slow down.   The head of the E.C.B. warned this week that she did not believe that inflation had reached a summit, and made clear that the bank would continue to raise interest rates as part of its efforts to bring down prices. After months of caution, the E.C.B. increased interest rates by three-quarters of a point in both October and November.   ''We do not see the components or the direction that would lead me to believe that we've reached peak inflation and that it's going to decline in short order,'' Christine Lagarde, the bank's president, told the European Parliament on Monday. Echoing remarks made last month by the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, Ms. Lagarde added that she believed inflation still had ''a way to go.''   Analysts have been debating whether the E.C.B. will continue with the more aggressive approach of recent months, or ease back to an increase of only half a percentage point at its meeting on Dec. 15.   Even as inflation has cooled, so has economic growth in the eurozone, which t was just 0.2 percent from July through September, and analysts and officials are predicting negative growth for the last quarter of 2022.   Paolo Gentiloni, the European Union's commissioner for the economy, said this month that he expected the bloc would see a contraction during the winter, though some economists believe it will not be as severe as previously predicted.   The European Union, along with Britain, is suffering from the twin plagues of rising inflation and slowing or declining growth. Russia's war against Ukraine and retaliatory sanctions against Russia, one of the world's biggest energy and grain producers, have caused global fuel, food and fertilizer prices to soar. Supply chain disruptions rooted in the pandemic and continuing Covid-19 lockdowns in China have added to the pile of economic problems.   In Britain, consumer prices surged 11.1 percent from a year earlier in October, the highest rate in more than 40 years. In the United States, prices climbed 7.7 percent over the year through October, far faster than the roughly 2 percent pace that was normal before the pandemic   Ms. Lagarde also said she did not believe that the price of energy, still extremely high compared with last year, had been fully passed down to households. Several governments have intervened to protect consumers from the high prices, further complicating projections about prices.   At the same time, the E.C.B. remains concerned that workers will start demanding, and winning, wage increases to keep up with the jumps in consumer prices, which would keep inflation elevated and still leave workers with less spending power. So far, that has not happened on a significant scale.   Germany's powerful I.G. Metall union, which represents 3.9 million workers in the country's electrical and metalworking sectors, agreed this month to a wage increase that was lower than inflation. The pay deal calls for raising pay 8.5 percent over the next two years.   Economists welcomed the agreement for establishing an element of certainty over a longer period, which could take some of the pressure off the central bank. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/world/europe/eurozone-inflation-november.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B6."
"20","The Job Market Is Hot. That Won't Help to Cool Inflation.","December 3, 2022 Saturday","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 14",1218,"Jim Tankersley and Jeanna Smialek",NA,"The president is celebrating a jobs engine that is running hot; Federal Reserve officials want to see more signs of slowing growth amid their campaign to tame inflation. WASHINGTON -- President Biden is overseeing the sort of labor market that, by most measures, any White House would celebrate. Unemployment remains near a half-century low, the Labor Department reported on Friday. As it recovers steep pandemic losses, the economy has already added more jobs through November than in any other year on record, except for 2021, Mr. Biden's first in office.    The president cheered those numbers on Friday: ''We continue to create jobs -- lots of jobs,'' he told reporters before signing a bill to avert a nationwide rail strike. ''We're in a situation where things are moving -- moving in the right direction.''   But for the Federal Reserve, the report offered little to celebrate. Officials have been waiting for hiring and wage growth to slow, paving the way for a more balanced economy where inflation, which is running near a 40-year high, can return to normal. Instead, both have remained resiliently strong even as the early effects of the Fed's rapid 2022 interest rate increases begin to play out.   ''In the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech this week. Officials are looking for ''the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.''   That divide -- between whether strong job gains should be seen as good news for workers or bad news for inflation -- underscores the unique challenges that lie ahead for the economy and the White House next year.   The president has consistently preached cautious optimism about the economy, even as inflation has stubbornly defied his administration's predictions that it would soon moderate. ''We are seeing initial signs that we are making progress in tackling inflation, even as we make the transition to more steady, stable economic growth,'' Mr. Biden said in a news release on Thursday, before the jobs numbers were released. ''That's good news for the American people, and further evidence that my economic plan is working.''   The jobs report in some ways supported his sunny take. Employers added 263,000 jobs in November, continuing to provide the backbone of administration claims that the recovery is on track. In a background call with reporters on Thursday, administration economic officials emphasized that recent data, including consumer spending figures and current measures of quarterly growth, continue to show the U.S. economy holding up far better than comparable wealthy nations around the world.   Administration aides have also expressed a rising confidence that still-high inflation could, finally, be trending toward historically normal levels.   Yet the same resilience that is giving the Biden administration positive talking points today could create trouble later on if it makes it harder for the Fed to stamp out rapid inflation.   Consumer Price Index data show that inflation has begun to moderate, but it remains far faster than the Fed's goal: It was running at 7.7 percent in October compared with a year earlier, much more than the roughly 2 percent annual gains that used to be the norm.   Fed officials do see hopeful signs that inflation will cool next year. Supply chain problems are easing and market-based rent prices are no longer jumping, and both of those changes should provide some relief. But with the labor market so strong and wages climbing quickly, central bankers have also warned that it will be difficult for price increases to fall back to normal levels.   The labor market ''shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,'' Mr. Powell said this week.   That is what makes Friday's report an awkward one for the central bank. It provided welcome news that the labor market is resilient, on one hand, but it also showed that companies are hiring at more than 2.5 times the pace the Fed thinks is necessary to accommodate population growth. Wage growth re-accelerated on a monthly basis, climbing a hefty 5.1 percent compared with the prior year.   Investors read the report as a sign that the Fed will need to keep raising rates into 2023. That could make it harder to achieve a so-called ''soft landing,'' where inflation slows but the economy avoids recession -- an outcome that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Powell say they would like to see.   ''To the extent that Chair Powell put some air into the soft landing narrative this week, this report undoes that to some degree,'' said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research.   Mr. Dutta said that if the economy remains strong, that could prod Fed policymakers to work harder to slow consumer and business demand. That would increase the chances that the economy gets painfully squeezed down the road, sending unemployment higher.   Mr. Biden seemed to brush off those fears on Friday, noting that in recent months, wage gains have outpaced inflation: ''Wages for working families, in fact, over the last couple months have gone up. Up,'' he said. ''These wage increases are larger than the increase in inflation over the same period of time.''   But Fed officials have struck a firmer tone, making it clear that pay gains will need to come down in order for them to be confident that inflation is under control.   ''Strong wage growth is a good thing,'' Mr. Powell said this week. ''But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.''   The labor market could still slow next year, helping to weigh on inflation just as price increases on goods moderate and rent growth begins to cool -- after all, the Fed has raised rates significantly already, and those moves are only now trickling through to temper economic growth.   While job gains and wages were both well above economists' expectations, some analysts pointed out that they have been slowing over the course of 2022. Republicans seized on the data point as ''Biden's worst jobs report of the year.''   ''The number was better than expected, but when you look at the broader picture in the U.S. labor market, demand for workers is slowing,'' said Blerina Uruci, an economist at T. Rowe Price.   Central bankers have signaled that they will slow their pace of rate increases this month, which should give them more time to gauge how much more they need to do to restrain the economy. But many economists and investors on Wall Street expect that won't be enough to save the economy from a Fed-induced recession.   Bank of America economists wrote this week that they foresee a downturn, flowing from ''the headwinds of a weaker labor market, higher borrowing costs, tighter credit standards and weaker balance sheets.''   If the job market continues to sprint rather than slowing to a jog, the recession scenario looms more likely -- a possibility White House officials largely dismiss, but one that Fed officials have acknowledged.   ''I do continue to believe that there's a path to a soft or softish landing,'' Mr. Powell said this week. ''To the extent we need to keep rates higher longer, that's going to narrow the path to a soft landing.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/02/business/the-biden-economy-keeps-churning-out-jobs.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page A14."
"21","Rents continued to rise rapidly in November, a sign that inflation remains stubborn in key categories.","December 13, 2022 Tuesday 09:02 EST","BUSINESS",384,"Ben Casselman","Rents in November were 7.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the fastest year-over-year pace of growth in four decades.","Rents in November were 7.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the fastest year-over-year pace of growth in four decades. Rents continued to rise rapidly in November, a sign that inflation remains stubborn in some key categories even as price growth moderates in other areas. Rents rose 0.8 percent in November — up from 0.6 percent growth in October — and were 7.9 percent higher than a year earlier, the Labor Department said Tuesday. It was the fastest year-over-year pace of rent growth in four decades. The government’s measure of homeownership costs, which more closely track rents than the cost of buying a new home, also accelerated. Economists closely watch rents because shelter costs — including both renter and owner-occupied housing — is by far the largest component of the Consumer Price Index, and because they tend to be persistent: Unlike the prices of gas or food, once rents start rising, they tend to keep going up. Rents fell in some parts of the country early in the pandemic as people fled cities, then rebounded rapidly as the economy reopened and wages rose. Lately, there have been signs of relief: Data from private-sector sources like Zillow and Apartment List show that rents in recent months have been rising much more slowly — or even falling in some markets — for tenants signing new leases. That improvement has been slow to show up in official measures of inflation, however. That’s at least partly because the Consumer Price Index takes into account rental costs for all tenants, not just those signing new leases. Because most leases run for a year or more, the government’s measure of rents tends to move more slowly than private figures that focus on listed rents. Most forecasters are confident that the government’s rent measure will begin to ease next year, but they aren’t sure when or by how much. If rent growth moderates by spring, as some economists expect, it will help pull down overall inflation and give policymakers some confidence that their efforts are working. If rents are slower to cool, however, overall inflation is likely, once again, to remain higher for longer than Fed officials expect."
"22","State Tax Cut Policies Prop Up Income, Fanning Inflation Worries","December 1, 2022 Thursday 23:20 EST","BUSINESS",691,"Alan Rappeport","Efforts around the country to ease the pain of rising prices have given consumers more money to spend, which could paradoxically further drive up prices.","Efforts around the country to ease the pain of rising prices have given consumers more money to spend, which could paradoxically further drive up prices. WASHINGTON — For months, economists have warned that efforts by states to buffer their constituents from rising prices with tax rebates and stimulus checks might, paradoxically, make inflation worse by giving consumers more money to spend. New income data released Thursday suggests that the state help is, in fact, making a difference to consumers by notably boosting their incomes. That could fan price increases going forward if it helps to fuel continued solid spending. According to the report, personal income climbed by 0.7 percent in October, notably more than the 0.4 percent the previous month, partly because of increases in government social benefits that “primarily” reflected “one-time refundable tax credits issued by states,” the report said. Solid income gains — which are also being fueled by higher wages and salaries — could give consumers more confidence to keep opening their wallets as they head into the holiday season. That could in turn give companies the ability to continue charging more for goods and services at a time when inflation is proving stubbornly rapid. Prices as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index rose by 6 percent in the year through October, according to a report from the Commerce Department. That was a slower increase than in the month before, but inflation remains three times the Federal Reserve’s target despite hopeful recent signs that it is beginning to moderate. How much state help will fuel consumption — and future price increases — is an open question. Tracking the value of refundable tax credits provided by the states can be complicated. The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis said that it relied on media reports and “state-level administrative data” to estimate the value of these one-time tax credits that were granted this year. As part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that Democrats in Congress passed last year, states, counties and cities were granted $350 billion in stimulus money. Although the law restricted states from using the funds to subsidize tax cuts, the courts have blocked that requirement and many state lawmakers — Republicans and Democrats — have opted to use budget surpluses to cut taxes or grant tax credits. Economists have been fearful that additional stimulus funds will fan inflation by giving people more money to spend and enabling them to bid up prices for goods and services. Since states have enacted different policies at different times throughout the past year, it is hard to pinpoint the precise impact that local relief efforts are having on the national economy. Through mid-July, 10 states had enacted individual income tax rate cuts, six states had passed corporate income tax rate reductions, five states suspended their gasoline taxes, and two states exempted groceries from sales taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. Direct tax rebates were also popular, with 11 states returning surplus revenue to taxpayers. Additional tax cuts are in the works in the states, despite concerns that inflation could remain high. Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Republican of Virginia, said last week that he intended to pursue tax cuts in his budget proposal next year. This week, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, a Democrat, signed legislation to extend gas tax cuts and pandemic premium pay. “We’re extending the gas tax holiday a little bit longer, providing energy assistance for those in need and increasing the amount of funding available for the pandemic pay program for the essential workers who’ve showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic,” Mr. Lamont said in a statement. “During the upcoming regular session, it is my goal to continue advancing more policy changes like these that will make a difference in the lives of the people who live here.”"
"23","The Year the Long Stock Market Rally Ended","December 30, 2022 Friday 12:38 EST","BUSINESS",1386,"Joe Rennison, Karl Russell and John-Michael Murphy","How fast inflation and high interest rates upended markets across the globe.","The Year the Long Stock Market Rally Ended Jan. 3, the first day of market trading in 2022, looked like just another day in a stock rally that began when Barack Obama was still president. The S&amp;P 500 hit a record high. Tesla, the company that upturned the auto industry and made many investors rich, rose 13.5 percent and came close to its own all-time peak. That Monday, it turned out, was actually the end of a market that for over a decade had gone mostly in one direction, with the S&amp;P 500 rising more than 600 percent since March 2009. Just two days later, the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its previous meeting — a typically routine event on Wall Street — revealing that policymakers at the central bank were so worried about inflation that they thought they might need to accelerate how fast they raised interest rates. Investors took it badly, causing the S&amp;P 500 to tumble 1.9 percent and igniting a stock sell-off that set the stage for the rest of the year. The past 12 months have marked a generational shift for financial markets as the Fed, racing to contain the worst inflation in decades, repeatedly raised interest rates. Its efforts have begun to pay off: Price increases have been slowing recently. But the Fed’s drastic actions to slow the U.S. economy, the world’s largest, have had widespread consequences. The year saw the end to an era of low interest rates that made borrowing cheap and encouraged investors to take risks — on the stocks of new tech companies, in cryptocurrencies and in debt markets — in the hunt for lucrative returns.  Neither the S&amp;P 500 nor Tesla has since reached the heights they achieved on Jan. 3. The S&amp;P 500, which finished lower on Friday, declined 19.4 percent for the year — its worst annual performance since 2008. Cryptocurrency giants like FTX have fallen, and debt is no longer cheap. But even as the U.S. economy heads toward a possible recession, the Federal Reserve has said its job is far from over. Inflation, while starting to cool, is still far too high, and interest rates are predicted to rise further, foretelling more pain. “Central banks drove markets this year because of inflation, and that will continue into 2023,” said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “This is a very, very dramatic, history-making moment in time. We have all been witness to a sequence of events, starting with the pandemic, that has been extraordinary.” The Fed’s challenge became even harder in late February when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent food and energy costs soaring, creating a crisis in poorer countries dependent on the import of oil and grain. In March, the Fed began to raise interest rates. Higher interest rates are central banks’ primary tool for combating inflation. When rates rise, borrowing costs also increase, slowing demand in the economy and in theory tempering further price increases. The yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds, which underpin borrowing costs across the globe, has soared 2.36 percentage points this year, its biggest annual rise on record for data going back to 1962. In turn, borrowing rates on mortgages, company bonds and other debt ratcheted higher. Higher costs also mean lower profits for companies, sending stock prices down. That proved especially true for tech companies, whose growth had been supported by low interest rates. The Nasdaq Composite index, which is chock-full of tech stocks, has fallen 33.1 percent in 2022. As investors lost money in the stock market, and households faced ballooning costs from inflation, the air came out of other, more speculative markets as well. The price of Bitcoin, one of the best-known cryptocurrencies, tumbled, and so-called meme stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment, whose share prices were propelled higher during the pandemic by a new breed of amateur investor, fell throughout the year. Tesla, popular with the same crowd of investors, has dropped 65 percent this year, its worst performance since the company went public in 2010 and only the second year the stock has declined in value. Despite rising inflation, the U.S. economy remained resilient, while Europe faced an energy crisis and emerging markets like Sri Lanka and Pakistan faltered. The relative strength of the United States made it a safe place for investors to put their money, and the influx of cash helped push the value of the dollar higher. For the first time in 20 years, the dollar was worth more than the euro. An unexpectedly dire report showing a collapse in consumer sentiment just days before the central bank was set to meet on June 15 spooked policymakers and helped send the S&amp;P 500 into a bear market, defined as a fall of at least 20 percent from its recent peak — in this case, Jan. 3. The Fed had already raised interest rates twice, by a total of 0.75 percentage points — as much as it had forecast in December 2021 would be necessary for the entire year — and was gearing up for another rate increase, expected to be 0.5 percentage points. Instead, the central bank raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points for the first time in almost three decades, indicating the risks the Fed attributed to rising inflation. Still, the turbulent events led some investors to feel that surely the worst was over. In July, as corporate financial reports started coming in looking better than had been expected, the stock market rallied. From mid-June to mid-August the S&amp;P 500 rose 17.4 percent. For the Fed, rising stock prices created a problem by enriching investors and working against its efforts to lower inflation. At a widely watched economic forum in Wyoming, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, sternly warned investors that the inflation fight was not over and that interest rates would need to rise considerably before the central bank would end its campaign. Stock markets began to fall again, and the S&amp;P 500 hit a new low in October. Heading into 2023, investors are setting themselves up for another fight with the Fed. Despite tremors from a wild swing in the value of British government debt in September, and then the unraveling of the crypto markets through November, the S&amp;P 500 has risen almost 8 percent from its low. In December, the Fed increased interest rates to a target range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent — well above expectations at the start of the year. Policymakers also raised their forecasts for how high interest rates would need to rise in 2023, but investors have barely blinked. There are signs of inflation cooling, and some see a greater likelihood that the central bank will pause further rate increases sooner than it has indicated to allow the effects of the current high interest rates to seep into the economy. “I think the equity market right now is a bit glass half full and is not completely pricing in what the Fed and other assets are telling us,” said Todd Sandoz, co-head of equities for the Americas at Barclays. Adding to the risk are corporate profits, which some investors expect to be revised sharply lower in early 2023, as prolonged inflation and elevated interest rates start to bite into earnings. That could mean that stocks have further to fall. A year ago, bank analysts responsible for projecting where stocks and bonds would end in 2022 were somewhat optimistic. According to a Bloomberg aggregation of forecasts, even the most pessimistic prediction for the S&amp;P 500 at that time — made by Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley — thought the index would finish the year 10 percent higher than where it actually will. Now, the most optimistic strategist this year, Hugo Ste-Marie at Scotiabank, doesn’t expect the S&amp;P 500 to even make up that lost ground in 2023, while most expect the market to end roughly where it’s starting, after a dip early in the year. “Given what has happened over the past 12 months we all have to be prepared for a significant surprise again, whether it’s from inflation or Fed policy,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group. “We have to be brave in thinking about the possibilities.”"

Despite rising inflation, the U.S. economy remained resilient, while Europe faced an energy crisis and emerging markets like Sri Lanka and Pakistan faltered. The relative strength of the United States made it a safe place for investors to put their money, and the influx of cash helped push the value of the dollar higher. For the first time in 20 years, the dollar was worth more than the euro.   An unexpectedly dire report showing a collapse in consumer sentiment just days before the central bank was set to meet on June 15 spooked policymakers and helped send the S&P 500 into a bear market, defined as a fall of at least 20 percent from its recent peak -- in this case, Jan. 3.   The Fed had already raised interest rates twice, by a total of 0.75 percentage points -- as much as it had forecast in December 2021 would be necessary for the entire year -- and was gearing up for another rate increase, expected to be 0.5 percentage points.   Instead, the central bank raised interest rates by 0.75 percentage points for the first time in almost three decades, indicating the risks the Fed attributed to rising inflation.   Still, the turbulent events led some investors to feel that surely the worst was over. In July, as corporate financial reports started coming in looking better than had been expected, the stock market rallied. From mid-June to mid-August the S&P 500 rose 17.4 percent.   For the Fed, rising stock prices created a problem by enriching investors and working against its efforts to lower inflation. At a widely watched economic forum in Wyoming, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, sternly warned investors that the inflation fight was not over and that interest rates would need to rise considerably before the central bank would end its campaign. Stock markets began to fall again, and the S&P 500 hit a new low in October.   Heading into 2023, investors are setting themselves up for another fight with the Fed. Despite tremors from a wild swing in the value of British government debt in September, and then the unraveling of the crypto markets through November, the S&P 500 has risen almost 8 percent from its low.   In December, the Fed increased interest rates to a target range between 4.25 and 4.5 percent -- well above expectations at the start of the year. Policymakers also raised their forecasts for how high interest rates would need to rise in 2023, but investors have barely blinked. There are signs of inflation cooling, and some see a greater likelihood that the central bank will pause further rate increases sooner than it has indicated to allow the effects of the current high interest rates to seep into the economy.   ''I think the equity market right now is a bit glass half full and is not completely pricing in what the Fed and other assets are telling us,'' said Todd Sandoz, co-head of equities for the Americas at Barclays.   Adding to the risk are corporate profits, which some investors expect to be revised sharply lower in early 2023, as prolonged inflation and elevated interest rates start to bite into earnings.   That could mean that stocks have further to fall.   A year ago, bank analysts responsible for projecting where stocks and bonds would end in 2022 were somewhat optimistic.   According to a Bloomberg aggregation of forecasts, even the most pessimistic prediction for the S&P 500 at that time -- made by Mike Wilson of Morgan Stanley -- thought the index would finish the year 10 percent higher than where it actually will. Now, the most optimistic strategist this year, Hugo Ste-Marie at Scotiabank, doesn't expect the S&P 500 to even make up that lost ground in 2023, while most expect the market to end roughly where it's starting, after a dip early in the year.   ''Given what has happened over the past 12 months we all have to be prepared for a significant surprise again, whether it's from inflation or Fed policy,'' said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group. ''We have to be brave in thinking about the possibilities.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/30/business/stock-market-2022.html  Graphic"
"25","For S&P 500, the Worst Year Since 2008","December 31, 2022 Saturday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2; STOCKS &AMP; BONDS",967,"The Associated Press",NA,"Wall Street capped a quiet day of trading with more losses on Friday, as it closed the book on the worst year for the S&P 500 since 2008. The benchmark index finished with a loss of 19.4 percent for 2022 -- just its third annual decline since the financial crisis 14 years ago and a painful reversal for investors after the S&P 500 notched a gain of nearly 27 percent in 2021. The Nasdaq composite, with a heavy component of technology stocks, racked up an even bigger loss of 33.1 percent.    The Dow Jones industrial average posted an 8.8 percent loss for 2022.   Stocks struggled all year as inflation put increasing pressure on consumers and raised concerns about economies slipping into recession. Central banks raised interest rates to fight high prices. The Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hikes remain a major focus for investors as the central bank walks a thin line between raising rates enough to cool inflation, but not so much that they stall the U.S. economy into a recession.   The Fed's key lending rate stood at a range of 0 percent to 0.25 percent at the beginning of 2022 and will close the year at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent after seven increases. The U.S. central bank forecasts that will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023. Its forecast doesn't call for a rate cut before 2024.   Rising interest rates prompted investors to sell the high-priced shares of technology giants such as Apple and Microsoft as well as other companies that flourished as the economy recovered from the pandemic. Amazon and Netflix lost roughly 50 percent of their market value. Tesla and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, each dropped more than 60 percent, their biggest-ever annual declines.   Russia's invasion of Ukraine worsened inflationary pressure earlier in the year by making oil, gas and food commodity prices even more volatile amid existing supply chain issues. Oil closed Friday around $80, about $5 higher than where it started the year. But in between oil jumped above $120, helping energy stocks post the only gain among the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, up 59 percent.   China spent most of the year imposing strict Covid-19 policies which crimped production for raw materials and goods, but is now in the process of removing travel and other restrictions. It's uncertain at this point what impact China's reopening will have on the global economy.   The Fed's battle against inflation, though, will likely remain the overarching concern on Wall Street in 2023, according to analysts. Investors will continue searching for a better sense of whether inflation is easing fast enough to take pressure off of consumers and the Fed.   If inflation continues to show signs of easing, and the Fed reins in its rate-hiking campaign, that could pave the way for a rebound for stocks in 2023, said Jay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Advisors.   ''The Fed has been the overhang on this market, really since November of last year, so if the Fed pauses and we don't have a major recession we think that sets us up for a rally,'' he said.   There was scant corporate or economic news for Wall Street to review on Friday. That, plus the holiday shortened week, set the stage for mostly light trading.   The S&P 500 fell 0.3 percent, posting a 5.9 percent loss for the month of December.   The Dow dropped 0.2 percent. The Nasdaq slipped 0.1 percent.   Tesla rose 1.1 percent, as it continued to stabilize after steep losses earlier in the week. The electric vehicle maker's stock plummeted 65 percent in 2022, erasing about $700 billion of market value.   Southwest Airlines rose 0.9 percent as its operations returned to relative normalcy following numerous cancellations over the holiday period. The stock still ended down 6.7 percent for the week.   Small-company stocks also fell on Friday. The Russell 2000 shed 5 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,761.25.   Bond yields mostly rose. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.88 percent from 3.82 percent late Thursday. Although bonds typically fare well when stocks slump, 2022 turned out to be one of the worst years for the bond market in history, thanks to the Fed's rapid rate increases and inflation.   Several big updates on the employment market are on tap for the first week of 2023. It has been a particularly strong area of the economy and has helped create a bulwark against a recession. That has made the Fed's job more difficult, though, because strong employment and wages mean it may have to remain aggressive to keep fighting inflation. That, in turn, raises the risk of slowing the economy too much and bringing on a recession.   The Fed will release minutes from its latest policy meeting on Wednesday, potentially giving investors more insight into its next moves.   The government will also release its November report on job openings on Wednesday. That will be followed by a weekly update on unemployment on Thursday. The closely watched monthly employment report is due on Friday.   Wall Street is also waiting on the latest round of corporate earnings reports, which will start flowing in around the middle of January. Companies have been warning investors that inflation will likely crimp their profits and revenue in 2023. That's after spending most of 2022 raising prices on everything from food to clothing in an effort to offset inflation, though many companies went further and actually padded their profit margins.   Companies in the S&P 500 are expected to broadly report a 3.5 percent drop in earnings during the fourth quarter, according to FactSet. Analysts expect earnings to then remain roughly flat through the first half of 2023.   U.S. stock markets will be closed on Monday in observance of the New Year's Day holiday. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/30/business/31markets.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."
"26","Indexes Extend Losing Streak to 3rd Week","December 24, 2022 Saturday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",640,"The Associated Press",NA,"A choppy day on Wall Street ended with broad gains for stocks on Friday, though most of the major indexes wound up with their third weekly loss in a row. Mixed economic news weighed on stocks early on, but the indexes rebounded by late afternoon amid relatively light trading ahead of a long holiday weekend.    The S&P 500 reversed a 0.7 percent loss to close 0.6 percent higher. With one week left of trading in 2022, the benchmark index is down 19.3 percent for the year.   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite eked out a 0.2 percent gain. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted their third straight weekly loss.   Markets are in a tricky situation where relatively solid consumer spending and a strong employment market reduce the risk of a recession but also raise the threat of higher interest rates from the Federal Reserve as it presses its campaign to crush inflation.   The government reported on Friday that a key measure of inflation is continuing to slow, though it's still far higher than anyone wants to see. The Fed monitors the inflation gauge in the consumer spending report, called the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index, even more closely than it does the government's better-known Consumer Price Index.   Also, growth in consumer spending weakened last month by more than expected, but incomes were a bit stronger than expected.   Helping to support the market was a separate report from the University of Michigan indicating U.S. households are lowering their forecasts for upcoming inflation. That may help avoid a scenario the Federal Reserve has said often it is desperate to prevent: a vicious cycle where shoppers rush to make purchases in advance of expected price rises, which would only worsen inflation.   The latest round of reports are the last big economic updates of the year and investors will soon turn their focus to the next round corporate earnings. Most investors are hoping to get a better sense of how consumers are doing through those reports and forecasts, along with the picture for corporate profits, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at Independent Advisor Alliance.   ''The stock market is in a tough spot,'' Mr. Zaccarelli said. ''If the consumer starts slowing down, earnings are likely to decrease, but if the consumer remains strong, the Fed has to remain strong and interest rates keep rising.''   The Fed has been upfront about its plan to remain aggressive in raising interest rates in order to tame inflation, even though the pace of price increases continue to ease. The Fed has already hiked its key overnight rate to its highest level in 15 years, after it began the year at a record low of roughly zero. The key lending rate, the federal funds rate, stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, and Fed policymakers forecast that the rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023.   Inflation remains a global problem. Japan reported its core inflation rate, excluding volatile fresh foods, rose to 3.7 percent in November, the highest level since 1981, as surging costs for oil and other commodities added to upward price pressures in the world's third-largest economy.   Roughly 80 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 notched gains on Friday. The index rose 22.43 points to 3,844.82. The Dow gained 176.44 points to 33,203.93. The Nasdaq rose 21.74 points to 10,497.86.   Oil and gas industry stocks were big gainers as energy futures prices closed broadly higher. Hess climbed 4.7 percent.   Communications services and financial stocks also posted solid gains. Disney rose 1.5 percent and American Express added 1.2 percent.   Smaller-company stocks also rose. The Russell 2000 index picked up 6.85 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,760.93.

"27","Indexes' Losing Streak Extends to 5th Day","December 20, 2022 Tuesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",611,"The Associated Press",NA,"Wall Street started off its week with more losses for stocks on Monday as investors braced for higher interest rates from central banks to fight inflation. The S&P 500 fell 0.9 percent, with most of the sectors in the index closing in the red. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5 percent. Small company stocks also fell, pulling the Russell 2000 1.3 percent lower.    The latest wave of selling extends the major indexes' losing streak to a fifth day. Each index posted a weekly loss the past two weeks.   Markets have been slumping as hopes for a gentler Federal Reserve vanish during a period of stubborn inflation. The central bank last week raised its forecast for how long interest rates would have to stay elevated to cool inflation, which has been hurting businesses and threatening spending. The European Central Bank also warned that more rate increase were coming.   Communications services stocks, technology companies and retailers were among the biggest losers on Monday. Disney slid 4.8 percent, Microsoft fell 1.7 percent and Home Depot dropped 1.9 percent.   Meta, Facebook's parent company, fell 4.1 percent after the European Union accused it of breaching antitrust rules by distorting competition in the online classified ads business.   U.S. crude oil prices rose 1.2 percent. That helped lift some energy stocks. Marathon Petroleum gained 1.2 percent.   All told, the S&P 500 fell 34.70 points to 3,817.66. The index is down about 20 percent in 2022, with less than two weeks left in the year.   The Dow dropped 162.92 points to 32,757.54, while the Nasdaq fell 159.38 points to 10,546.03. The Russell 2000 gave up 1.4 percent.   European markets mostly rose, while Asian markets closed lower overnight.   Treasury yields gained ground. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.58 percent from 3.49 percent late Friday.   Investors have several economic reports to review this week as they try to determine the continuing path of inflation.   The National Association of Realtors is scheduled to deliver its November tally of U.S. home sales on Wednesday. Home sales have been falling, but prices in the housing market have remained strong.   The Conference Board will release its consumer confidence report for December on Wednesday. Consumer confidence and spending have been strong areas of the economy, but inflation is starting to put a tighter squeeze on consumers.   The government will release a closely watched monthly snapshot of consumer spending on Friday, the personal consumption expenditure price index for November. The report is monitored by the Fed as a barometer of inflation.   The Fed ended its final meeting of the year last week by raising its short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, its seventh straight increase this year. More important, it signaled that it may have to maintain high interest rates longer than Wall Street had been anticipating in order to tame inflation.   The federal funds rate stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest level in 15 years. Fed policymakers forecast that the central bank's rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023. Their forecast does not call for a rate cut before 2024.   Inflation is showing signs of easing, but at a relatively slow pace. The Fed's aggressive policy risks hitting the brakes on the economy too hard, while at the same time, economic growth is already slowing because of pressure from inflation. That could result in a recession, which analysts expect in some form in 2023, though the severity and duration is difficult to forecast. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/business/20markets.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."
"28","Europe's Banks Raise Rates, and Prepare for More","December 16, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1605,"Eshe Nelson",NA,"The European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank raised interest rates by half a point, a day after the Federal Reserve did the same. Less than 24 hours after the Federal Reserve slowed its pace of interest rate increases, central banks in Europe did too, but they each stressed they were in a continuous battle against stubbornly high inflation.    The timings of the decisions were a scheduling coincidence: On Thursday, the European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank all raised interest rates by half a percentage point, after three-quarter point increases at previous meetings. The day before, Fed officials made the same policy move.   But the message to investors, businesses and households were all the same: Despite this slowdown in rate increases, it is too soon to declare victory over inflation and they should brace for higher rates.   In the eurozone, ''interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace'' to make sure they are restrictive enough to return inflation to the E.C.B.'s 2 percent target in a ''timely'' manner, the central bank said in a statement on Thursday.   For months, policymakers have taken forceful action to bring down inflation and stop expectations of future rapid price rises from setting in. But as they look ahead to next year, the picture is more complicated. Europe's economies are decelerating because of high energy costs and the lagging effects of months of the central bank's rate increases, which have made mortgages and other loans more expensive. Policymakers have been trying to calibrate the right amount of monetary tightening needed to bring down inflation despite this economic slowdown.   On Thursday, the E.C.B. used some of its most forceful language to indicate for the first time that monetary policy would need to be restrictive to tame inflation.   Eurozone policymakers expect to raise interest rates ''significantly further, because inflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above our target for too long,'' Christine Lagarde, the president of the E.C.B., said at a news conference in Frankfurt on Thursday. She said it would be ''obvious'' to expect more half-point rate increases.   The Bank of England wasn't as explicit about the path forward, but most of its nine-person rate-setting committee said they expected more increases in interest rates would be needed to bring inflation back to the bank's 2 percent target, according to the minutes of this week's meeting.   The Bank of England started raising rates a year ago and, over the course of nine consecutive policy meetings, has lifted rates from 0.1 percent to 3.5 percent, the highest since 2008.   Thomas Jordan, the head of the Swiss National Bank, said on Thursday that it ''cannot be ruled out'' that the bank would raise rates further to ensure price stability.   The prospect of higher interest rates restraining already weakening economies and worsening recessions led to a drop in stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic. The S&P 500 fell 2.5 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 2.9 percent.   Still, recent signs suggest that inflation may be at or near its peak in many economies.   The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone slowed last month to 10 percent, the first deceleration in more than a year. In Britain, consumer prices rose 10.7 percent in November from a year earlier, down slightly from 11.1 percent in October, the highest annual rate since 1981.    Nevertheless, policymakers judge that inflation could continue to be more persistent than they anticipate. Staff at the E.C.B. said inflation would average higher than previously expected this year and next, and would still be above the bank's 2 percent target in 2025.   Across the 19 countries that use the euro, prices are increasing at vastly different speeds. The annual rate of inflation last month slowed to 6.6 percent in Spain, but in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the rate remained above 21 percent.   Higher energy prices, especially since Russia's war in Ukraine began earlier this year, have heavily been responsible for the sharp increase in inflation in Europe. But the central banks have grown more concerned at the extent to which high prices have seeped into their economies, with service businesses (such as restaurants, hotels, airlines and insurance providers) setting higher prices, food prices rising rapidly and wage demands getting larger.   In Britain, service price inflation and wage growth in the private sector have been rising faster than the central bank expected. Before adjusting for inflation, private-sector pay rose at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the three months to October, data published on Tuesday showed.   The Bank of England might need to raise rates by at least another percentage point before stopping, Karen Ward, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a note, also arguing that the bank ''needs to be extremely vigilant that a new high-inflation mentality does not take hold.''   For the eurozone, the E.C.B. predicted that core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices and is one way to measure underlying inflation, would be above 4 percent next year, and would remain above 2 percent in 2025. On Thursday, Ms. Lagarde said that wages in the region were growing at rates ''well above'' historical averages and would push up inflation over the next few years.   Last month, IG Metall, a large metalworkers union in Germany, agreed to wage increases of 5.2 percent next year and 3.3 percent in 2024, plus two lump sum payments. The pay negotiations were watched closely as a harbinger of wage demands across the eurozone's largest economy.   In the end, the deal was far below Germany's annual inflation rate, which was 11.3 percent in November. But Isabel Schnabel, one of the E.C.B.'s policymakers, has noted that the agreement was still a ''much bigger'' increase than in the past. The bank must be active in preventing a wage-price spiral, she said at a conference in London last month.   Some policymakers have also expressed concern about expensive and untargeted policies by European governments designed to insulate households from high energy prices, because this largess risks increasing economic demand, causing inflation to persist. Fiscal policies ''should be temporary, targeted and tailored,'' Ms. Lagarde said. ''Measures falling short of these principles are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures.''   The recent political turmoil in Britain has served a warning here. Last month, the Bank of England raised rates by three-quarters of a point because policymakers expected the fiscal plans of Liz Truss, the former prime minister, which included a plan to freeze household energy bills for two years, to add to inflationary pressures. After her turbulent premiership ended, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government revoked nearly all of her policies and announced a 55 billion pound ($68 billion) plan for higher taxes and spending cuts. The overall impact of these measures on inflation is expected to be small, the Bank of England said on Thursday.   These central banks are planning to forge a path with higher interest rates even as economic growth across the region deteriorates, and much of the impact of past rate increases hasn't been felt yet.   In Britain, two policymakers, Silvana Tenreyro and Swati Dhingra, voted to hold rates steady, arguing that higher interest rates were already tightening financial conditions, and cited the weakness in the economy from incomes lagging far behind inflation. It was the first time since March that any committee members had voted to keep rates on hold.   The bank predicts that the economy is already in a recession that will be ''prolonged.'' Households are contending with the highest food price inflation in more than four decades, combined with a jump in mortgage costs and higher energy bills. As wages fall far behind inflation, workers in many sectors are holding walkouts. This week, railroad workers, postal delivery staff and nurses were among those on strike.   The E.C.B. said that the eurozone economy might contract this quarter and the next one because of higher energy costs, economic uncertainty and the impact of tighter financial conditions. The bank's staff lowered its forecasts for the eurozone economy next year, predicting it would grow 0.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 0.9 percent.   Although the European Central Bank had previously emphasized that it had raised interest rates by a historical amount already, these concerns were pushed aside this month as the bank's forecasts showed inflation still exceeding the target in 2025.   ''Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations,'' the E.C.B. said on Thursday.   The bank raised all three of its key interest rates on Thursday, including the deposit rate, which is what banks receive for depositing money with the central bank overnight, from 1.5 percent to 2 percent, the highest since January 2009.   As the E.C.B. moves further away from the extraordinary monetary policies of the past eight years that were designed to stoke economic demand and inflation, it also said it would also shrink the size of its substantial bond holdings.   Beginning in March, the asset purchase program, which holds bonds worth about 3.3 trillion euros ($3.5 trillion), will decline ''at a measured and predictable pace'' as the bank stops reinvesting all the proceeds from maturing assets, the bank said. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/business/european-central-bank-inflation-interest-rates.html  Graphic"
"29","Stocks Fall as Brighter Economic Data Stoke Fears of More Rate Hikes","December 22, 2022 Thursday 23:36 EST","BUSINESS",647,"Emily Flitter","Two economic reports on Thursday fanned fears that the Federal Reserve might need to go further in its aggressive fight against inflation.","Two economic reports on Thursday fanned fears that the Federal Reserve might need to go further in its aggressive fight against inflation. A recession looks less likely, and fewer Americans are unemployed. That was bad news for stocks on Thursday. The major indexes fell sharply as fresh economic data revived worries about the Federal Reserve’s attempts to battle inflation. “We’re still in a bit of ‘good news is bad news for the market,’ because better-than-expected economic data means the Fed’s going to remain more restrictive on their policies,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at the brokerage firm BTIG. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, Labor Department data showed on Thursday, suggesting that the job market remained tight. At the same time, an update on gross domestic product indicated that the economy rebounded faster in the third quarter than previously estimated. Combined, the economic reports suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve might need to continue to push interest rates higher and hold them there longer in an attempt to slow the economy. In afternoon trading, the S&amp;P 500 was down nearly 3 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down roughly 3.7 percent. By the end of the day, each index had regained some ground. The S&amp;P and the Dow fell 1.4 percent and 1 percent, while the Nasdaq finished 2.2 percent lower. Stock trading has been volatile throughout the week as investors have grappled with the Fed’s resolve to remain aggressive in its fight against inflation. Fed officials indicated last week that interest rates would rise more drastically than many had expected as policymakers tried to wrangle stubborn price increases. “We have more work to do,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said last week. His message echoed around the world as central banks in Europe also announced new rate increases. Selling intensified on Thursday after David Tepper, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, said on CNBC that he was betting that stock prices would continue to fall. “As a hedge fund manager, I’m going to lean short,” Mr. Tepper said, citing the global movement by central banks to use higher interest rates and other monetary tightening measures to try to slow inflation. “I think the upside/downside just doesn’t make sense to me when I have so many people telling me, so many central banks telling me what they’re going to do,” he said. The latest update on gross domestic product showed that the U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 3.2 percent annual pace from July through September. That was up from an earlier estimate of 2.9 percent. The quarterly growth followed a contraction during the first half of the year. Investors will get another update on consumer spending and inflation on Friday, when the government releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures index for November. The Fed monitors the report as a barometer of inflation. Despite Thursday’s strong numbers, recent economic data have been mixed. Experts expect Friday’s report to show that inflation continued to cool in November. To Mr. Krinsky, Thursday’s sell-off was not a surprise. Stock price movements in December, especially at the end of the month, tend to echo whatever longer-term trend is already in place. Fewer market participants are around to trade, and it is unlikely that they will make bold bets at this time of year. “We’re still in a bear market,” Mr. Krinsky said, adding that he viewed stock prices as being caught in a lose-lose scenario for the rest of the year. “If economic data is better, the Fed’s going to remain restrictive, and if economic data deteriorates we’re probably heading into a much deeper recession. That’s the lose-lose proposition for the market right now,” he said. This article appeared in print on page B2."

Policymakers have been trying to calibrate the right amount of monetary tightening needed to bring down inflation despite this economic slowdown. On Thursday, the E.C.B. used some of its most forceful language to indicate for the first time that monetary policy would need to be restrictive to tame inflation. Eurozone policymakers expect to raise interest rates “significantly further, because inflation remains far too high and is projected to stay above our target for too long,” Christine Lagarde, the president of the E.C.B., said at a news conference in Frankfurt on Thursday. She said it would be “obvious” to expect more half-point rate increases. The Bank of England wasn’t as explicit about the path forward, but most of its nine-person rate-setting committee said they expected more increases in interest rates would be needed to bring inflation back to the bank’s 2 percent target, according to the minutes of this week’s meeting. The Bank of England started raising rates a year ago and, over the course of nine consecutive policy meetings, has lifted rates from 0.1 percent to 3.5 percent, the highest since 2008. Thomas Jordan, the head of the Swiss National Bank, said on Thursday that it “cannot be ruled out” that the bank would raise rates further to ensure price stability. The prospect of higher interest rates restraining already weakening economies and worsening recessions led to a drop in stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.5 percent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 dropped 2.9 percent. Still, recent signs suggest that inflation may be at or near its peak in many economies. The annual rate of inflation in the eurozone slowed last month to 10 percent, the first deceleration in more than a year. In Britain, consumer prices rose 10.7 percent in November from a year earlier, down slightly from 11.1 percent in October, the highest annual rate since 1981.  Nevertheless, policymakers judge that inflation could continue to be more persistent than they anticipate. Staff at the E.C.B. said inflation would average higher than previously expected this year and next, and would still be above the bank’s 2 percent target in 2025. Across the 19 countries that use the euro, prices are increasing at vastly different speeds. The annual rate of inflation last month slowed to 6.6 percent in Spain, but in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the rate remained above 21 percent. Higher energy prices, especially since Russia’s war in Ukraine began earlier this year, have heavily been responsible for the sharp increase in inflation in Europe. But the central banks have grown more concerned at the extent to which high prices have seeped into their economies, with service businesses (such as restaurants, hotels, airlines and insurance providers) setting higher prices, food prices rising rapidly and wage demands getting larger. In Britain, service price inflation and wage growth in the private sector have been rising faster than the central bank expected. Before adjusting for inflation, private-sector pay rose at an annual rate of 6.9 percent in the three months to October, data published on Tuesday showed. The Bank of England might need to raise rates by at least another percentage point before stopping, Karen Ward, a strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, wrote in a note, also arguing that the bank “needs to be extremely vigilant that a new high-inflation mentality does not take hold.” For the eurozone, the E.C.B. predicted that core inflation, which excludes energy and food prices and is one way to measure underlying inflation, would be above 4 percent next year, and would remain above 2 percent in 2025. On Thursday, Ms. Lagarde said that wages in the region were growing at rates “well above” historical averages and would push up inflation over the next few years. Last month, IG Metall, a large metalworkers union in Germany, agreed to wage increases of 5.2 percent next year and 3.3 percent in 2024, plus two lump sum payments. The pay negotiations were watched closely as a harbinger of wage demands across the eurozone’s largest economy. In the end, the deal was far below Germany’s annual inflation rate, which was 11.3 percent in November. But Isabel Schnabel, one of the E.C.B.’s policymakers, has noted that the agreement was still a “much bigger” increase than in the past. The bank must be active in preventing a wage-price spiral, she said at a conference in London last month. Some policymakers have also expressed concern about expensive and untargeted policies by European governments designed to insulate households from high energy prices, because this largess risks increasing economic demand, causing inflation to persist. Fiscal policies “should be temporary, targeted and tailored,” Ms. Lagarde said. “Measures falling short of these principles are likely to exacerbate inflationary pressures.” The recent political turmoil in Britain has served a warning here. Last month, the Bank of England raised rates by three-quarters of a point because policymakers expected the fiscal plans of Liz Truss, the former prime minister, which included a plan to freeze household energy bills for two years, to add to inflationary pressures. After her turbulent premiership ended, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government revoked nearly all of her policies and announced a 55 billion pound ($68 billion) plan for higher taxes and spending cuts. The overall impact of these measures on inflation is expected to be small, the Bank of England said on Thursday. These central banks are planning to forge a path with higher interest rates even as economic growth across the region deteriorates, and much of the impact of past rate increases hasn’t been felt yet. In Britain, two policymakers, Silvana Tenreyro and Swati Dhingra, voted to hold rates steady, arguing that higher interest rates were already tightening financial conditions, and cited the weakness in the economy from incomes lagging far behind inflation. It was the first time since March that any committee members had voted to keep rates on hold. The bank predicts that the economy is already in a recession that will be “prolonged.” Households are contending with the highest food price inflation in more than four decades, combined witha jump in mortgage costs and higher energy bills. As wages fall far behind inflation, workers in many sectors are holding walkouts. This week, railroad workers, postal delivery staff and nurses were among those on strike. The E.C.B. said that the eurozone economy might contract this quarter and the next one because of higher energy costs, economic uncertainty and the impact of tighter financial conditions. The bank’s staff lowered its forecasts for the eurozone economy next year, predicting it would grow 0.5 percent, down from a previous forecast of 0.9 percent. Although the European Central Bank had previously emphasized that it had raised interest rates by a historical amount already, these concerns were pushed aside this month as the bank’s forecasts showed inflation still exceeding the target in 2025. “Keeping interest rates at restrictive levels will over time reduce inflation by dampening demand and will also guard against the risk of a persistent upward shift in inflation expectations,” the E.C.B. said on Thursday.  The bank raised all three of its key interest rates on Thursday, including the deposit rate, which is what banks receive for depositing money with the central bank overnight, from 1.5 percent to 2 percent, the highest since January 2009. As the E.C.B. moves further away from the extraordinary monetary policies of the past eight years that were designed to stoke economic demand and inflation, it also said it would also shrink the size of its substantial bond holdings. Beginning in March, the asset purchase program, which holds bonds worth about 3.3 trillion euros ($3.5 trillion), will decline “at a measured and predictable pace” as the bank stops reinvesting all the proceeds from maturing assets, the bank said."
"31","Strong Economic News Weakens Stocks","December 23, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",646,"Emily Flitter",NA,"Two economic reports on Thursday fanned fears that the Federal Reserve might need to go further in its aggressive fight against inflation. A recession looks less likely, and fewer Americans are unemployed. That was bad news for stocks on Thursday.    The major indexes fell sharply as fresh economic data revived worries about the Federal Reserve's attempts to battle inflation.   ''We're still in a bit of 'good news is bad news for the market,' because better-than-expected economic data means the Fed's going to remain more restrictive on their policies,'' said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at the brokerage firm BTIG.   The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, Labor Department data showed on Thursday, suggesting that the job market remained tight. At the same time, an update on gross domestic product indicated that the economy rebounded faster in the third quarter than previously estimated.   Combined, the economic reports suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve might need to continue to push interest rates higher and hold them there longer in an attempt to slow the economy.   In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down nearly 3 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down roughly 3.7 percent. By the end of the day, each index had regained some ground. The S&P and the Dow fell 1.4 percent and 1 percent, while the Nasdaq finished 2.2 percent lower.   Stock trading has been volatile throughout the week as investors have grappled with the Fed's resolve to remain aggressive in its fight against inflation. Fed officials indicated last week that interest rates would rise more drastically than many had expected as policymakers tried to wrangle stubborn price increases.   ''We have more work to do,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said last week. His message echoed around the world as central banks in Europe also announced new rate increases.   Selling intensified on Thursday after David Tepper, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, said on CNBC that he was betting that stock prices would continue to fall.   ''As a hedge fund manager, I'm going to lean short,'' Mr. Tepper said, citing the global movement by central banks to use higher interest rates and other monetary tightening measures to try to slow inflation.   ''I think the upside/downside just doesn't make sense to me when I have so many people telling me, so many central banks telling me what they're going to do,'' he said.   The latest update on gross domestic product showed that the U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 3.2 percent annual pace from July through September. That was up from an earlier estimate of 2.9 percent. The quarterly growth followed a contraction during the first half of the year.   Investors will get another update on consumer spending and inflation on Friday, when the government releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures index for November. The Fed monitors the report as a barometer of inflation.   Despite Thursday's strong numbers, recent economic data have been mixed. Experts expect Friday's report to show that inflation continued to cool in November.   To Mr. Krinsky, Thursday's sell-off was not a surprise. Stock price movements in December, especially at the end of the month, tend to echo whatever longer-term trend is already in place. Fewer market participants are around to trade, and it is unlikely that they will make bold bets at this time of year.   ''We're still in a bear market,'' Mr. Krinsky said, adding that he viewed stock prices as being caught in a lose-lose scenario for the rest of the year.   ''If economic data is better, the Fed's going to remain restrictive, and if economic data deteriorates we're probably heading into a much deeper recession. That's the lose-lose proposition for the market right now,'' he said. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/22/business/stock-market-today.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."
"32","Fed Raises Rate At Slower Pace But Is Not Done","December 15, 2022 Thursday","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1",1198,"Jeanna Smialek and Joe Rennison",NA,"Central bankers made a smaller rate move, but predicted that they will weigh the economy down more aggressively than previously expected Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday slowed their campaign to cool the economy but indicated that interest rates would rise higher in 2023 than previously expected as inflation proves more stubborn than policymakers had hoped.    Fed officials voted unanimously at the conclusion of their two-day meeting to raise borrowing costs by half a percentage point, a pullback after four consecutive three-quarter point increases. Their policy rate is now set to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent, the highest it has been since 2007.   After months of moving rapidly to make money more expensive in an attempt to rein in an overheating economy, central bankers are entering a phase in which they expect to adjust policy more cautiously. That will give them time to see how the labor market and inflation are reacting to the policy changes they have already put in place.   Yet the Fed's latest economic projections, released on Wednesday for the first time since September, sent a clear signal that slowing the pace of rate increases does not mean that officials are letting up in their battle against rapid inflation. Borrowing costs are expected to rise more drastically and inflict more economic pain than central bankers previously anticipated as policymakers attempt to wrangle stubborn price increases.   ''We've continually expected to make faster progress on inflation than we have,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during his news conference after the release. He described the Fed's new expectations as: ''slower progress on inflation, tighter policy, probably higher rates, probably held for longer, just to get you to the kind of restriction that you need to get inflation down to 2 percent.''   Officials are now expecting to raise their policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of 2023, which would mean another three-quarter-point worth of adjustments and would push it half a percentage point higher next year than officials previously anticipated. Policymakers also expect to keep borrowing costs higher for longer.   ''We have more work to do,'' Mr. Powell said.   The Fed's higher rates are expected to cool the economy notably next year. Central bankers predict that unemployment will jump to 4.6 percent from 3.7 percent now, and then remain elevated for years. Growth is expected to be much weaker in 2023 than previously anticipated, pushing the economy to the brink of a recession.   ''I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to have a recession or not, and if we do, whether it's going to be a deep one or not,'' Mr. Powell said. ''It's not knowable.''   The central bank's aggressive stance comes as central bankers worry that inflation will remain high for years to come. Though price increases are already beginning to moderate from the four-decade highs they reached this summer, the Fed's economic projections make clear that policymakers think it is going to take years to return inflation fully to their 2 percent goal.   Despite the tough talk from the Fed, investors on Wednesday seemed unconvinced. Stock prices in the S&P 500 fluctuated higher and lower as Mr. Powell spoke at a news conference before ending the day down 0.6 percent.   And though the Fed expects to keep rates above 5 percent through the end of 2023, investors are still betting that the central bank will stop raising rates sooner and begin cutting them earlier.   ''Financial markets want black and white, and you're working in shades of gray,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, explaining that investors are not internalizing the Fed's nuanced message.   That divergence could be a problem for central bankers. Higher stock prices and lower market-based interest rates make money cheaper and easier to borrow, helping to stimulate the economy -- the opposite of the Fed's goal as it tries to lower inflation.   ''You hear the mantra, 'Don't fight the Fed,' but at the moment the market is willing to fight the Fed,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. ''It's an interesting dissonance that creates a risk for the market.''   Mr. Powell has repeatedly emphasized that his central bank is determined to keep fighting inflation until it is thoroughly vanquished, and on Wednesday he underlined that wrestling price pressures back under control is likely to take some time.   The Fed has recently received evidence that inflation is moderating, including in fresh Consumer Price Index data released Tuesday. Economists have spent months of waiting for rapid price increases in goods -- from used cars to apparel -- to slow as supply chains healed, which finally seems to be happening. Housing inflation is also poised to cool in 2023 as a recent slowdown in market-based rents shows up in official data, which should allow services inflation to begin to moderate.   But Mr. Powell said during his news conference that Fed officials need ''substantially more evidence'' to feel confident that inflation is on a sustained downward path.   In particular, a sharper economic deceleration may be needed for quick service price increases to fade fully. The job market is very strong and wages are growing rapidly, which could keep prices rising for things like haircuts, restaurant meals and financial help. That's because as they pay their workers more, companies are likely to charge more to try to protect their profits.   ''We do see a very, very strong labor market, one where we haven't seen much softening,'' Mr. Powell said. ''Really there's an imbalance in the labor market between supply and demand, so that part of it, which is the biggest part, is likely to take a substantial period to get down.''   Mr. Powell said, ''That's really why we're writing down those high rates and why we're expecting that they'll have to remain high for a time.''   Even if the Fed can set the economy down relatively gently, officials expect their path to cause at least some pain in the labor market. While that is an unattractive prospect, central bankers believe it is necessary to prevent price increases from beginning to feed on themselves.   If consumers get used to rapid inflation and begin asking for bigger raises, and companies make bigger and more regular price adjustments to cover rising input and labor bills, fast price increases could become entrenched.   In the 1970s, officials allowed inflation to remain more rapid than usual for years on end, which created what economists have since called an ''inflationary psychology.'' When oil prices spiked for geopolitical reasons, an already elevated inflation base and high inflation expectations helped price increases to climb drastically. Fed policymakers ultimately raised rates to nearly 20 percent and pushed unemployment to double digits to bring prices back under control.   Officials today want to avoid a rerun of that painful experience. That's why they have signaled that they do not want to give up on their fight against inflation too early.   ''I wish there were a completely painless way to restore price stability,'' Mr. Powell said. ''There isn't.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/business/economy/interest-rates-inflation-fed.html  Graphic"
"33","Shares Rally as Jobs Market Stays Strong","December 30, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",586,"The Associated Press",NA,"Relatively light trading on Wall Street ended Thursday with a broad rally for stocks as investors welcomed new jobless benefits data that shows the labor market remains strong. The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent, with roughly 95 percent of stocks within the benchmark index closing higher. The gains more than made up for the index's losses the previous two days, the latest oscillation in what has been a volatile, holiday-shortened week for stocks.    The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.6 percent.   Technology stocks, which are down 29 percent this year, powered much of the rally. Apple and Microsoft each rose 2.8 percent.   Tesla jumped 8.1 percent as it continued to recover from steep losses Tuesday after reports it temporarily suspended production at a factory in Shanghai. The stock is still down nearly 66 percent for the year.   Investors have been hoping for a ''Santa Claus'' rally. That's Wall Street's term for when stocks rise in the last five trading days of December and first two of January. Even a late rally would probably not change the broader market's trajectory for the month.   Every major index is headed for a loss in December that will cap a dismal year. While companies in the S&P 500 raked in record profits this year, investors in the benchmark index will see a roughly 20 percent loss in 2022, which would be its worst year since 2008.   Still, going back to World War II, history suggests the market may fare better next year, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.   ''When you look at down years for the market, history offers some encouragement in that the market is up an average of 14 percent in the following year and has risen in price more than 80 percent of the time,'' Mr. Stovall said.   The S&P 500 rose 66.06 points to 3,849.28. The Dow added 345.09 points to 33,220.80. The Nasdaq rose 264.80 points to close at 10,478.09.   Small company stocks also posted solid gains. The Russell 2000 index rose 44.23 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1,766.25.   Treasury yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell.   Markets in Europe closed higher, while markets in Asia slipped.   Investors have been focused on the Federal Reserve's continuing fight against hot inflation. The central bank has been raising interest rates in an effort to stifle borrowing and spending and cool inflation, but the strategy risks going too far and sending the economy into a recession. That has put an even greater focus on a wide range of data for Wall Street as it tries to determine whether inflation is cooling and how various areas of the economy are faring.   The latest U.S. update shows that the number of people seeking unemployment benefits rose only slightly last week. The labor market has been one of the stronger areas of the economy. That's normally good news, and it has helped create a bulwark against a recession as other areas of the economy slow. It has also made the Fed's fight against inflation harder and means the central bank will probably have to remain aggressive, raising the risk that its policy could set off a recession.   The Fed has already raised its key interest rate seven times this year and is expected to continue raising rates in 2023. The key lending rate, the federal funds rate, stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, and Fed policymakers forecast that the rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023. Their forecast doesn't call for a rate cut before 2024. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/business/30markets.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."

"35","The Year in Charts","December 31, 2022 Saturday","Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; Pg. 20",1372,"Steven Rattner",NA,"After a couple of tough years, 2022 felt like a step back from the brink. The terror of Covid receded. A new president who seemed on the precipice of failure basked in a fistful of legislative successes. And perhaps most importantly, Donald Trump's grip on a large swath of the country showed signs of finally beginning to loosen. But let's not uncork the Champagne just yet. Inflation continued to bedevil the economy, leading to large interest rate increases and stock market declines. International challenges -- from the stalemate in Ukraine to rising tensions with China -- intensified. The belligerent voices of the extreme right seemed to only intensify.    Chart 1:   Among the happy surprises of the year was the Democrats' unexpectedly strong performance in the midterm elections. With President Biden's approval ratings deeply underwater, history would have suggested a massive Republican victory -- a loss of perhaps four seats in the Senate and 40 in the House. Instead, Democrats ceded just nine seats in the House -- barely losing control of the lower chamber -- and gained a Senate seat. (Notably, it was the first midterm since 1934 that the party in power retained all of its senatorial incumbents.) With the benefit of hindsight, pundits ascribed the surprise outcome to factors ranging from too many Donald Trump-like Republican candidates to the Supreme Court's decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling guaranteeing women's right to an abortion.   Chart 2:   In the wake of the Supreme Court's Dobbs ruling, access to abortion almost immediately began to disappear as pre-Roe ''trigger'' laws came into effect and Republican-controlled state legislatures passed greater restrictions. By the end of 2022, 23 percent of American women resided in states with effective bans on abortion. Still more women found themselves living in states that had sharply limited the window in which terminating a pregnancy would be permitted. These changes don't reflect public opinion: Since Dobbs, voters in Kansas, Kentucky and Montana have rejected anti-abortion ballot measures. Nationally, a July poll found that 62 percent of Americans believe abortion should be legal, at least in most cases.   Chart 3:   For a substantial majority of Americans, the economy remained the most important issue as prices continued to rise rapidly, reaching a peak inflation rate of 9.1 percent in June. Happily, the overall rate then began to decline, falling to 7.1 percent in November. But because of the volatility of food and energy prices, economists often pay more attention to the ''core'' rate, which excludes those categories. That rate has remained stubbornly high, at 6 percent, far above the Federal Reserve's target of 2 percent. As the year progressed, the major contributors to core inflation shifted from goods (the Covid buying frenzy subsided) to services like travel, hospitality and housing.   Chart 4: The sustained period of high inflation left the Fed playing catch-up ball, as it had initially believed that the surge would prove transitory. The central bank imposed a stiff set of interest rate increases and projected that more are still to come. As recently as a year ago, the bank predicted that the federal funds rate would barely exceed 2 percent by 2024; at present, it expects the rate to exceed 5 percent in 2023. In concert, the bank's projections for inflation, unemployment and economic growth all deteriorated during the year. Even those forecasts may prove too optimistic; while the Fed expects the economy to eke out a small amount of growth in 2023, most economists expect a recession by late 2023 or early 2024.   Chart 5:   After two years of Covid dominating the headlines, the virus mostly slipped from the front pages as deaths fell from  over 3,000 per day in January during the Omicron spike down to fewer than 400 per day near the end of the year. While the return to normalcy was welcome, too many Americans ignored the urging of public health officials and forwent the recommended third and fourth jabs. A plea by New York City mayor Eric Adams to resume mask-wearing and encourage vaccinations in the city, for example, had no discernible impact, with only 12 percent of residents receiving the fourth injection.   Chart 6:   Along with Covid, the supply chain problems that bedeviled businesses and consumers alike began to ebb. Shipping times from Asia, which had hovered below 60 days before Covid, and jumped toover 110 days early in 2022, had fallen back to less than 80 days by year end. Transport costs also fell -- the Shanghai shipping price index, which had quintupled between January 2020 and January 2022, fell back to just 10 percent above January 2020 levels. Domestically, production delays continued, with more than a third of American manufacturing plants reporting shortages of materials and labor. That, in turn, meant continuing frustration for Americans trying to shop, whether for the holidays or their other needs.   Chart 7:   It was a busy year in Washington. Congress passed important legislation to address weaknesses in the presidential election certification process and our faltering international position in semiconductor production as well as the oddly named Inflation Reduction Act, our most important step to date to attack the problem of climate change. The I.R.A. allocated nearly $400 billion to clean energy, largely via tax credits, and a smaller amount to loan programs, research and the like. While we have already been reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, the I.R.A. is projected to reduce those emissions by an additional 10 percentage points by 2030. That would put our projected emissions in 2030 at 60 percent of 2005 levels. Under the Paris agreement, we need to be at 50 percent of 2005 levels in 2030, so there is important work left to do.   Chart 8:   Internationally, Ukraine proved the most challenging armed conflict in years, quickly becoming a kind of proxy war pitting Russia against the United States, Europe and many other nations. In human terms, the war has been among the deadliest Europe has seen in several decades, and the true toll is likely higher than officially recorded. While Ukrainians and Russians are mainly doing the actual fighting, an enormous amount of financial, military and humanitarian aid has flowed from the U.S. and Europe -- almost $50 billion from us alone, with another $45 billion on the way. The war also caused massive disruption in world energy markets -- particularly for European nations that relied on Russian natural gas -- and contributed meaningfully to the global inflation problem.   Chart 9:   Then there was China. Our biggest source of imported goods became ever more clearly our biggest strategic adversary. President Xi Jinping was elected to an unprecedented third five-year term and quickly packed the Standing Committee, the seven-member core group of the Politburo, with loyalists. In both rhetoric and policy, Mr. Xi continued to emphasize security and the military and to partially reverse China's movement toward greater free enterprise. This -- plus the country's incoherent Covid policies -- caused a dramatic slowdown in the economy and a sharp drop in share prices. As the year ended, Mr. Xi pivoted modestly to try to reassure both his citizens and investors that his vision for China included a growing market economy.   Chart 10:   While Mr. Trump may be out of the White House, he was not out of the political arena. For most of the year, his popularity, at least among Republicans, remained strong. In polling data, he stood well ahead of his perceived principal rival, Florida governor Ron DeSantis. But after the disastrous midterms, the mood of his party seemed to shift. His margin in polls for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination over Mr. DeSantis fell from an average of 22 percentage points on average to just 1.4 percentage points. Many other factors contributed to Mr. Trump's troubles: his retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, his dinner with a white supremacist, the recommendation of the January 6 panel that he be criminally prosecuted, and the release of his tax returns. Oh, and of course his ridiculous hawking of digital trading cards. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/opinion/the-year-in-charts.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page A20."
"36","Russia's Key Interest Rate Holding Steady","December 17, 2022 Saturday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3",751,"Ivan Nechepurenko",NA,"The country's central bank said inflation, at 12 percent, risked rising because of a growing budget deficit. Russia's central bank kept its key interest rate at 7.5 percent on Friday, citing risks of increased inflation and restrained consumer demand as economists warned that the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions were continuing to sap productivity.    The Bank of Russia said in a statement that ''the external conditions for the Russian economy remain complicated and significantly limit economic activity.'' It said consumer prices rose at annual rate of 12 percent last month, pushed by a tight labor market that was accelerating wage growth.   The Russian economy has come under severe international sanctions in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, but it has defied expectations of a collapse unseen since the painful post-Soviet transformation in early 1990s.   On Thursday, President Vladimir V. Putin radiated confidence at a meeting with top government ministers in which he said the Russian economy would contract 2.5 percent this year, which is somewhat more optimistic than the International Monetary Fund's estimate of a 3.5-percent shrinkage. Accusing the West of waging ''an economic war'' against Moscow and praising his government's ''responsible financial policy,'' Mr. Putin said the country's economy had avoided an outright collapse.   Still, some Russian economists predicted that the worst is yet to come. Yevgeny Nadorshin, the chief economist at the PF Capital consulting company in Moscow, warned that the Russian economy could now enter a deeper downturn that cannot be cushioned by increased government spending as before.   The mobilization of recruits to help fight in Ukraine, and an exodus of  some highly skilled upper-middle-class  workers, would have a negative effect on  productivity, he said. In addition, the government's increased focus on military spending will make the economy less productive.   ''We are doomed to deal with a tough deficit of highly effective labor while sanctions limit our way to compensate for this in terms of imports of high-end technology,'' Mr. Nadorshin said in a telephone interview.   In late February, after Mr. Putin's decision to send troops to Ukraine, inflation surged in Russia, and the central bank more than doubled its benchmark interest rate, to 20 percent. Since then, it has cut the rate six times as inflation has eased and the bank tried to stimulate an economy dealing with increased isolation.   The central bank projected that annual inflation would decline to as low as 5 percent in 2023 and 4 percent in 2024.   Dmitri Polevoy, the chief strategist at Locko Invest, an asset management company in Moscow, said that sanctions would have a prolonged effect on Russia's economy and that it was no longer important how much it will contract this year.   ''What is interesting is how much deeper will the contraction be next year than what the government expects,'' he said, noting that the widening budget deficit was turning into ''the main headache'' for the central bank.   Indeed, the Bank of Russia said Friday that the budget deficit might force it tighten its policy  to control inflation.   For years, the Russian economy, and its tax revenues, relied on a huge exports of fossil fuels. But the country's energy industry has been upended by the war in Ukraine, most recently by a European Union embargo on Russian oil and the Group of 7's price cap on Russian crude, both of which took effect Dec. 5. Last week, Russia's finance minister said the country's budget deficit will reach 2 percent of economic output this year, up from earlier predictions of 0.9 percent, according to TASS, a state news agency.   The central bank noted that unemployment in Russia had dropped to a record low, partly because the mobilization of troops to join fighting in Ukraine had reduced the supply of available workers. In its Friday statement, the central bank warned that the conscription effort had forced employers to increase salaries.   Outside Russia, the effects of the war in Ukraine have manifested in soaring energy and food prices, pushing inflation in Europe, the United States and elsewhere far above levels that policymakers try to maintain. This week, the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of England all raised interest rates and pledged to continue tightening their policies until stubbornly high inflation came under control, even as their economies show signs of slowing, if not outright recession. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/world/europe/russia-central-bank-interest-rate.html  Graphic"
"37","Markets Welcome Signs of Fed Slowdown","December 14, 2022 Wednesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",719,"Isabella Simonetti",NA,"Wall Street is expecting the Federal Reserve to slow down its interest rate increases, but the central bank's meeting on Wednesday offers investors a reason to be cautious. Stocks rose on Tuesday after a softer-than-expected inflation report for November cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve could slow its campaign to raise interest rates, which has weighed heavily on stock prices.    An early surge faded however, and the S&P 500 ended the day with a gain of 0.7 percent, after climbing more than 2 percent soon after the start of trading. The benchmark index is still down about 16 percent for the year.   For months, Wall Street has been looking for data that could encourage the Fed to moderate its interest rate increases, which the central bank has used to try to temper stubbornly high inflation but which also increase costs for companies and dampen consumer demand. The central bank is expected to raise rates by half a percentage point on Wednesday, which would represent a slowdown from increases of three-quarters of a point in previous meetings since June.   Investors now expect that the Fed will reduce the size of its rate increase again in February, with bets that the central bank will lift rates by just a quarter of a percentage point, a smaller increase than they were earlier anticipating. In addition, investors expect interest rates to reach 4.85 percent next year, down from expectations of more than 5 percent last month, futures contracts indicated on Tuesday.   ''The pieces are falling into place for the Fed to pause rate hikes early in 2023,'' said Rob Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard.   Overall inflation measured by the Consumer Price Index rose 7.1 percent in November, from a year ago, compared with economists' expectations of a gain of 7.3 percent and down from a gain of 7.7 percent in October.   The report is a welcome sign for investors after a mixed bag of economic data in recent weeks have delivered signals that suggest inflation may remain stubbornly high, weighing on markets.   A gauge of wholesale prices showed inflation rising more than expected last month. The job market also remains resilient, putting pressure on prices: Employers added 263,000 jobs in November -- more than economists expected.   At the same time, a rise in the markets make the Fed's job harder because it enriches investors and stimulates the economy, the opposite of what central bankers are trying to do to bring down inflation.   The yield on the U.S. two-year Treasury note, which closely tracks expectations for Fed rate moves, also fell on Tuesday, to about 4.23 percent, as investors dialed back expectations for how high the Fed will ultimately raise rates. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was also lower, falling to about 3.51 percent.   As the Fed has continued its campaign to increase rates to bring down inflation, the yield on the two-year bond has risen well above the 10-year equivalent, a rare but reliable sign that investors in the bond market are expecting the economy to slip into a recession.   ''I think inflation is coming down because growth is slowing and that will be a problem. But that's not this week's concern,'' said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities.   For investors, the debate will now shift from the size of rate increases to how long the Fed will keep interest rates elevated, with investors eager for clues when central bankers meet on Wednesday.   The inflation report and the Fed meeting ''will undoubtedly set the tone for financial markets as we head into next year,'' economists at Deutsche Bank wrote in a research note on Friday.   ''This was universally good from an inflation standpoint,'' Mr. Tchir said. It's moving in the right direction.''   Elsewhere, Tesla slumped by 4.1 percent to $160.95, hitting a fresh low for the year. The company has fallen more than 60 percent from its peak in 2021.   Stocks in Europe jumped on Tuesday. The EuroStoxx 600 index climbed 1.3 percent, as did the Dax index in Germany.   Crude oil prices were also higher. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose over 3 percent to settle above $80 for the first time in a week. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. oil benchmark, rose 3 percent to $75.39.

"38","Bumpy Day Leaves Wall Street in the Red","December 15, 2022 Thursday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2; STOCKS &AMP; BONDS",667,"The Associated Press",NA,"A bumpy day of trading on Wall Street ended with stocks broadly lower Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate in its fight against inflation and signaled that more increases lay ahead. As expected, the central bank raised its key short-term rate by 0.50 percentage points, marking its seventh hike this year. The Fed also said it expected to raise rates higher over the coming few years than it had previously anticipated.    The S&P 500 lost 0.6 percent after giving up an earlier gain of 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite gave back 0.8 percent. Bond yields mostly fell after a brief rally following the Fed's midafternoon announcement.   ''The market was expecting the Fed to tone down its hawkishness, which it did not,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at the financial research firm CFRA.   The Fed's latest hike is smaller than the previous four 0.75 percentage point increases and comes a day after an encouraging report showed that inflation in the United States slowed in November for a fifth straight month.   Recent signs that inflation, while still painfully high, has eased had stoked optimism on Wall Street that the Fed might signal the possibility of rate cuts in the second half of next year. But during a news conference after the Fed's latest policy announcement, Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell emphasized that the full effects of the central bank's efforts to slow the economy to bring down inflation have yet to be fully felt.   ''The inflation data received so far for October and November show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of price increases, but it will take substantially more evidence to give confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path,'' Mr. Powell said.   Mr. Powell also reiterated that the Fed plans to hold rates at a level high enough to slow the economy ''for some time'' to ensure inflation really is crushed. He said the Fed's projections released Wednesday do not include any for rate cuts in 2023.   ''I wouldn't see the committee cutting rates until we're confident that inflation is moving down in a sustained way,'' Mr. Powell said.   He also said the pace Fed rate increases is not that important. ''It's far more important to think what is the ultimate level,'' Mr. Powell said.   The latest increase brings the Fed's federal funds rate to a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, its highest level in 15 years. Fed policymakers forecast that the cental bank's rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023. That suggests the Fed is prepared to raise rates by an additional 0.75 percentage points next year.   The Fed also signaled it expects its rate will come down by the end of 2024 to 4.1 percent, and drop to 3.1 percent at the end of 2025.   ''This is considerably higher than expectations priced into financial markets, which are positioned for the federal funds rate to come back down to 3.9 percent at the end of 2023 and to 2.6 percent at the end of 2024,'' said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank.   Bond yields wavered for much of the afternoon as traders digested the Fed's action. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, slipped from late Tuesday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed moves, held steady at 4.22%.   Wall Street has been closely watching economic reports on consumer spending and employment, which remain strong. That has made it more difficult for the Fed to tame inflation while also helping to protect the slowing economy from a possible recession.   The U.S. will release its weekly report on unemployment benefits on Thursday, along with retail sales data for November.   Roughly 70 percent of the stocks in the S&P 500 closed lower Wednesday, with technology companies, banks and retailers among the biggest weights on the benchmark index. Apple fell 1.6 percent, Goldman Sachs dropped 2.3 percent and Best Buy slid 3.9 percent. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/14/business/14markets.html  Graphic"
"39","Consumer Confidence Report Lifts Stocks","December 22, 2022 Thursday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2; STOCKS &AMP; BONDS",595,"The Associated Press",NA,"Stocks closed broadly higher on Wall Street Wednesday and pushed major indexes into the green for the week, as investors welcomed a report showing consumer confidence is holding up better than expected. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite each rose 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.6 percent with a lot of help from Nike, which soared after reporting better-than-expected results.    Small company stocks also gained ground. The Russell 2000 index rose 1.7 percent. Treasury yields mostly fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, slipped to 3.68 percent.   The market got a boost from a report showing consumer confidence is surprisingly strong, despite inflation squeezing wallets. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 108.3 in December, up from 101.4 in November. The sharp rebound pushed the index to its highest level since April. Last month's figure was the lowest since July.   ''The news has delivered a kind of a sweet spot for the Federal Reserve,'' said Megan Horneman, chief investment officer at Verdence Capital Management. ''The consumer is staying relatively resilient.''   Consumer spending, along with the employment market, has been another strong area of the economy that has helped protect it from slipping into a recession. Wall Street has been hoping that the Fed can win its fight against inflation and avoid a recession, what economists call a ''soft landing.'' The latest consumer confidence report raises hopes for that outcome in 2023, analysts said.   ''If the consumer continues to feel good, behave in a rational way and remain employed, the window for a soft landing expands,'' said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at Globalt Investments.   The Fed's key lending rate, the federal funds rate, stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest level in 15 years. Fed policymakers forecast that the rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023. Their forecast doesn't call for a rate cut before 2024.   Investors are worried that the Fed will go too far in raising interest rates and ultimately slow the economy so much that it slips into a recession. That has left investors closely focused on economic updates to get a better idea of how businesses and consumers are dealing with inflation.   New data released Wednesday showed the nation's housing market continued to slow last month, as sales of previously occupied homes fell for the tenth month in a row. The housing market has been a strong area of the economy, but has been tempered by rising mortgage rates. That has made an already tight housing market even more difficult for prospective home buyers.   The government will release a closely watched monthly snapshot of consumer spending on Friday, the personal consumption expenditure price index for November. The report is monitored by the Fed as a barometer of inflation, which has been easing, but at a relatively slow pace. Economists expect the report to show that inflation continued cooling in November.   Technology companies powered a big share of the rally Wednesday. Apple rose 2.4 percent.   Health care and financial company stocks also helped lift the market. Eli Lilly rose 2.3 percent and Bank of America added 1.5 percent.   Nike surged 12.2 percent for the biggest gain among S&P 500 stocks after reporting results that trounced analysts' estimates. FedEx rose 3.4 percent after reporting strong earnings. Energy stocks gained ground as U.S. crude oil prices settled 2.9 percent higher.

This summer, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to fight inflation, almost every central bank around the world raced to keep up. The Bank of Japan alone stood firm. But on Tuesday, the central bank of the world’s third-largest economy seemed to have a sudden change of heart, signaling that it could begin moving away from years of ultraloose policies aimed at spurring wages and prices higher. The bank said it would loosen the tight limits it had imposed on bond yields, a move that could crack open the door for future interest rate increases. The change surprised investors in Asia who had been expecting the bank to make such a decision next year. In a policy statement, the Bank of Japan said it would allow the yield on its 10-year bonds to move in a range of plus or minus 0.5 percent, broadening the band from 0.25 percent, as it seeks to promote trading of domestic bonds, which has stagnated. At the same time, the bank will increase its monthly bond purchases to $67 billion from around $55 billion, the statement said. Analysts had predicted that Japan’s central bank would hold fast to its current monetary settings through at least the spring, when its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, will step down. “The consensus was entirely that the B.O.J. would stand pat,” said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics. In its statement, the bank said it had made the change in light of deteriorating bond market conditions caused, in part, by “volatility in overseas financial and capital markets.” For years, the Bank of Japan has limited yields to a tight range to keep interest rates low, a policy it has incrementally loosened since its introduction in 2016. But in recent months the restrictions, maintained with enormous buying operations, had brought the trading of some government bonds to a near standstill. The bank said its new policy change would help support the ultralow rates that had for years provided households and businesses with a steady flow of cheap money. One of the pillars of that policy — near-zero interest rates — will remain unchanged, the bank said in its statement. In a news briefing after the statement’s release, Mr. Kuroda said it was “too early to consider reviewing or exiting” its current easing policies. Japan has felt the sting of skyrocketing food and energy prices because of supply chain snarls and the war in Ukraine. Inflation, while much lower than in other parts of the world, was at 3.6 percent in October, putting a substantial burden on households that became accustomed to decades of price stability and wage stagnation. Making matters worse is a weak Japanese yen. Earlier this year, the currency traded at a decades-long low against the dollar, placing even more price pressure on the economy, which is heavily dependent on imports. The yen’s weakness has been exacerbated by the Bank of Japan’s insistence on sticking to ultralow interest rates even as other central banks have precipitously raised their own in an effort to tamp down runaway inflation. The gap has put pressure on the yen as investors move money out of Japan in search of higher returns. The currency has regained lost ground in recent weeks as other central banks have slowed their interest rate increases. It jumped in value after Tuesday’s announcement, by more than 3 percent. A surge in the currency’s value could help reduce inflationary pressures on the economy. Mr. Kuroda has said he would stick to the bank’s current rate policy until the bank achieved sustainable, demand-driven inflation of 2 percent, a level that policymakers argue would create a virtuous cycle of growing corporate profit and wages. While current levels have exceeded that target, the bank argues that the price increases are largely driven by supply constraints, not the heightened demand it aims to create. In its statement, the bank said it would maintain its current inflation target until it could be maintained in a “stable manner,” adding that it would “not hesitate to take additional easing measures, if necessary.” Hisako Ueno contributed reporting.

"42","What TikTok Told Us About the Economy in 2022","December 31, 2022 Saturday 12:13 EST","BUSINESS; economy",1607,"Jeanna Smialek","From Barbiecore to revenge travel, social media trends gave us a clear picture of the forces reshaping the economy.","From Barbiecore to revenge travel, social media trends gave us a clear picture of the forces reshaping the economy. The unemployment rate has hovered at 3.7 percent for months. But it is the TikTok-famous “quiet quitting” and live-tweeted resignations that really explained what was going on in America’s job market in 2022, a moment of renewed worker power and remarkable upheaval. While government data can tell us that the world is rapidly changing three years into the pandemic, internet trends — the ones that took off and the apps we’ve come to rely on — illustrate how people are responding to a new and evolving normal. Negroni sbagliatos catapulted into fame and onto cocktail menus, underlining the fact that people were ready to get back to spending on fancy happy hours. Instagram feeds filled with beach and mountain pictures as “revenge travel” took flight. We collectively learned what “vibe shift” means just as we realized that the economy was experiencing one. Below is a rundown of a few of the year’s more colorful memes and moments — and what they herald for  2023. Break My Soul Between high inflation and years of workplace flux — including pandemic firings, work-from-home burnout and most recently a plodding return to office — the economic status quo seemed like an increasingly bad deal to many Americans in 2022. Beyoncé imprinted the discontent on your favorite music app, releasing an instant hit titled “Break My Soul.” Its lyrics included “And I just quit my job, I’m gonna find new drive,” inspiring the internet to ask whether Queen B was encouraging everyone to join the Great Resignation. In fact, people felt so conflicted about work this year that they needed new words to describe it. The TikTok discourse gave us “quiet quitting,” a trend in which workers do the bare minimum. Then came “career cushioning,” discreetly lining up a backup plan while in your current job. At the same time, employers reported “worker hoarding,” in which they avoided firing people after getting burned by long months in which open jobs far outnumbered applicants. The jobs data made it clear that the labor market was out of balance, but it was social discussion that showed just how much. Money Printer Go ‘Brrrr-oke’ The Federal Reserve reversed two years of rock-bottom rates this year, raising borrowing costs at the fastest pace in decades in a bid to control rapid inflation. Actual prices have been slow to react, but Reddit wasn’t. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, formerly featured in memes that sported the tagline “money printer go brrrr” and showed him cranking out cheap and easy cash. In 2022, the memes got an update — to Shrek. Today’s memes compare Mr. Powell to the 2001 movie character Lord Farquaad, who famously declared, “Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I’m willing to make.” The crankiness on the Reddit discussion boards came as the Fed’s actions cost many investors money. Prominent cryptocurrencies tanked, and asset prices in general swooned, with stocks down about 20 percent from the start of the year. Financial markets are likely to remain on edge into 2023: Inflation is slowing but remains high, and the Fed is poised to raise rates at least slightly more to control it. The memes, in short, are likely to remain grim. Butter Boards TikTok spent part of this year going crazy for butter boards: slabs of the spread covered in flowers, fancy salt, honey or other flavorings. Was this a delayed reaction to the low-fat, no-fat fads of decades past? Evidence that influencers can make us do anything? One thing we can say for sure: It was expensive. That’s because prices for food — and especially for dairy products — have jumped sharply this year. Butter and margarine costs were 34 percent higher in November than 12 months before. Food overall was up 10.6 percent. But as the butter board’s enduring popularity underscored, people buy food even when it is getting costlier. In fact, while retailers reported that some lower-income consumers began pulling back on discretionary purchases and giving priority to necessities, spending in general has been fairly resilient despite a year and a half of rapid price increases and months of Fed rate moves. So far, inflation also remains heady, and it extends well beyond the dairy aisle. A popular price index is still 7.1 percent above its level a year ago, far faster than the typical 2 percent annual pace. Barbiecore Americans continued to shop in 2022, but what they are buying has been undergoing a quiet change. Americans had been snapping up goods like couches and clothing early in the pandemic, but they are now slowly shifting their purchases back toward services. Social media popularized over-the-top fashions in 2022, including “Barbiecore” (very pink, named for the doll and upcoming movie) and “avant apocalypse,” which paid sartorial homage to the coming end days. But another big trend of the year — buying used clothes, #thrifted — may have more accurately captured the year’s changing economic energy. Clothing store sales are slowing down, official data show, and falling outright if you subtract out apparel inflation. Have a Reservation? As the world reopened and Americans returned to spending on experiences, restaurant tables, in particular, became a hot commodity. Walk-in tables were down 14 percent compared with 2019, while tables with online reservations increased by 24 percent, according to data from the table booking app OpenTable. The figures confirmed what denizens of New York and other cities could tell you (and did, in various media dissections): It was a battle to get a table in 2022 as waitstaff shortages collided with hot diner demand. OpenTable’s data show that happy hour especially surged in 2022. People are dining earlier, and, after years of missed work drinks, this is the overpriced cocktail’s comeback tour. It’s one added reason that Negronis made with Prosecco, popularized by a promotional video for the show “House of the Dragon” on HBO’s TikTok account, are having a moment. No Room at the Inn It turns out people missed the beach just as much as they missed that 5 o’clock martini. Cue the “revenge travel.” Vacationers made up for pandemic-delayed trips en masse in 2022, and as they splurged on big adventures, air traffic rebounded sharply, getting close to its 2019 levels. Hotel revenues fully recovered. At the same time, some travel-related sectors skated by on extremely thin staffing. Employment in accommodation stands at just 83 percent of its February 2020 level. Air transport employment overall is up, but industry groups have complained of worker shortages in key areas like air traffic control. As hotels, motels and airlines struggled to operate at full capacity, room rates and fares rocketed higher and major disruptionsbecame commonplace. Air travel service complaints were more than 380 percent above their 2019 level as of September, according to the Department of Transportation. The mismatch underscored that key parts of the American economy are struggling to reach a new equilibrium after pandemic-induced tumult, even if people want to be in #vacationmode. Peak Wedding In some instances, pandemic trends are colliding with demographic trends — and nothing showed that more clearly than the many wedding photos that filled up Instagram feeds this year. After years of historically few ceremonies leading up to the pandemic, this was probably the biggest year for weddings since 1997, based on data and forecasts compiled by the Wedding Report, a trade publication. The pop, the combined result of pandemic-delayed nuptials and a big group of marriage-age millennials, translated into booked-up venues and vendors. It has also raised questions about the economic ripple effects: Will those couples have children, sending up birth data, which already ticked up slightly in 2021? Will they buy houses? We could start to find out in 2023. Grandmillennial America’s younger generations are doing more than getting married. They have been forming their own households and buying houses in greater numbers since the start of the pandemic. In the process, they have helped to fuel strong demand for houses and popularized interior decorating trends — including “grandmillennial,” also affectionately called “granny chic” on Pinterest, in which the young-ish repurpose floral wallpaper and old-style lamps for a cozy but updated look. But many millennials, who are roughly ages 26 to 41 and in their peak home-buying years, may be losing their shot at becoming real estate influencers. As the Fed lifted interest rates to stifle rapid inflation this year, a wave of would-be homeowners began to find that the combination of heftier mortgage costs and high home prices meant they could not afford to buy. New home sales have declined notably. Fed rates are expected to continue climbing in 2023, which could make for a tough road ahead for a generation struggling to make the leap in homeownership. And after a year of serious economic changes and major policy adjustments, it’s uncertain what is coming next: A recession? A benign inflation cool-down? On the bright side, we will have social trends to help us interpret the data, and occasionally to help us find its lighter side.

"43","What's It All Mean? Click On TikTok.","December 31, 2022 Saturday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1617,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"From Barbiecore to revenge travel, social media trends gave us a clear picture of the forces reshaping the economy. The unemployment rate has hovered at 3.7 percent for months. But it is the TikTok-famous ''quiet quitting'' and live-tweeted resignations that really explained what was going on in America's job market in 2022, a moment of renewed worker power and remarkable upheaval.    While government data can tell us that the world is rapidly changing three years into the pandemic, internet trends -- the ones that took off and the apps we've come to rely on -- illustrate how people are responding to a new and evolving normal.   Negroni sbagliatos catapulted into fame and onto cocktail menus, underlining the fact that people were ready to get back to spending on fancy happy hours. Instagram feeds filled with beach and mountain pictures as ''revenge travel'' took flight. We collectively learned what ''vibe shift'' means just as we realized that the economy was experiencing one.   Below is a rundown of a few of the year's more colorful memes and moments -- and what they herald for  2023.   Break My Soul   Between high inflation and years of workplace flux -- including pandemic firings, work-from-home burnout and most recently a plodding return to office -- the economic status quo seemed like an increasingly bad deal to many Americans in 2022. Beyoncé imprinted the discontent on your favorite music app, releasing an instant hit titled ''Break My Soul.'' Its lyrics included ''And I just quit my job, I'm gonna find new drive,'' inspiring the internet to ask whether Queen B was encouraging everyone to join the Great Resignation.   In fact, people felt so conflicted about work this year that they needed new words to describe it. The TikTok discourse gave us ''quiet quitting,'' a trend in which workers do the bare minimum. Then came ''career cushioning,'' discreetly lining up a backup plan while in your current job. At the same time, employers reported ''worker hoarding,'' in which they avoided firing people after getting burned by long months in which open jobs far outnumbered applicants. The jobs data made it clear that the labor market was out of balance, but it was social discussion that showed just how much.   Money Printer Go 'Brrrr-oke'   The Federal Reserve reversed two years of rock-bottom rates this year, raising borrowing costs at the fastest pace in decades in a bid to control rapid inflation. Actual prices have been slow to react, but Reddit wasn't. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, formerly featured in memes that sported the tagline ''money printer go brrrr'' and showed him cranking out cheap and easy cash. In 2022, the memes got an update -- to Shrek. Today's memes compare Mr. Powell to the 2001 movie character Lord Farquaad, who famously declared, ''Some of you may die, but that is a sacrifice I'm willing to make.''   The crankiness on the Reddit discussion boards came as the Fed's actions cost many investors money. Prominent cryptocurrencies tanked, and asset prices in general swooned, with stocks down about 20 percent from the start of the year. Financial markets are likely to remain on edge into 2023: Inflation is slowing but remains high, and the Fed is poised to raise rates at least slightly more to control it. The memes, in short, are likely to remain grim.   Butter Boards   TikTok spent part of this year going crazy for butter boards: slabs of the spread covered in flowers, fancy salt, honey or other flavorings. Was this a delayed reaction to the low-fat, no-fat fads of decades past? Evidence that influencers can make us do anything? One thing we can say for sure: It was expensive.   That's because prices for food -- and especially for dairy products -- have jumped sharply this year. Butter and margarine costs were 34 percent higher in November than 12 months before. Food overall was up 10.6 percent.   But as the butter board's enduring popularity underscored, people buy food even when it is getting costlier. In fact, while retailers reported that some lower-income consumers began pulling back on discretionary purchases and giving priority to necessities, spending in general has been fairly resilient despite a year and a half of rapid price increases and months of Fed rate moves.   So far, inflation also remains heady, and it extends well beyond the dairy aisle. A popular price index is still 7.1 percent above its level a year ago, far faster than the typical 2 percent annual pace.   Barbiecore   Americans continued to shop in 2022, but what they are buying has been undergoing a quiet change. Americans had been snapping up goods like couches and clothing early in the pandemic, but they are now slowly shifting their purchases back toward services.

"44","Widespread Gains Push Indexes Higher","December 13, 2022 Tuesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",639,"The Associated Press",NA,"Stocks closed higher on Monday as Wall Street kicked off a busy week in which central banks were likely to unload the year's final barrage of interest-rate increases meant to drive down the world's painfully high inflation. The S&P 500 rallied 1.4 percent, trimming its loss for the year to 16.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.6 percent, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.3 percent. Small company stocks also rose, pushing the Russell 2000 index 1.2 percent higher. The indexes were coming off their first weekly loss in three weeks.    The gains were widespread, with more than 90 percent of stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 index closing higher. Treasury yields rose broadly.   The market rally came ahead of a key inflation report on Tuesday and a meeting of policymakers at the Federal Reserve. Investors expected the Fed to announce its last rate increase of the year on Wednesday, part of a blitz that began in March.   ''Tomorrow, the inflation data is pretty important because we've been getting some decent reads,'' said Tom Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ''Not to say that inflation has been coming down by leaps and bounds, but sort of at the margin it looks as though prices are getting a little bit weaker.''   High inflation and the higher interest rates engineered to combat it have been the main causes of Wall Street's struggles for much of this year.   Higher rates slow the economy by design and risk causing a recession if they go too high, all while dragging down prices of investments. One upside for investors is that the Fed has hinted it will dial down the size of its rate increases, leading to expectations for a more modest increase of 0.50 percentage points on Wednesday.   That would follow four straight increases of 0.75 percentage points. Each was triple the Fed's usual move, and the increases lifted the central bank's key overnight rate to a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent after starting the year at virtually zero.   Other central banks around the world are also likely to raise their own rates by half a percentage point this week, including the European Central Bank.   Any dialing down of the rate increases would mean less pain for markets and the economy. Such hopes have helped stocks and bonds rally since mid-October, as investors have taken data reports to mean the worst of inflation has finally passed and would allow the Fed to ease up.   But expectations for a slowdown in rate increases may also be setting up some investors for disappointment, if central banks signal this week that they will ultimately take rates higher than markets expect.   While they are not the clear majority of the market, many traders are betting the Fed's overnight interest rate will top out at a range of 4.75 percent to 5 percent next year, for example.   Economists at Goldman Sachs expected Fed policy makers to signal on Wednesday that their median expectation is for rates to hit a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent, up by half a percentage point from their last projection.   Some investors also continue to make moves in anticipation of the Fed cutting interest rates during the second half of 2023. Rate cuts generally act as steroids for stocks and other investments, but the Fed has been insisting it plans to hold rates at a high level for some time to ensure the battle against inflation is won.   Even if inflation is indeed on its way down, the global economy still faces threats from the rate increases already pushed through. The housing industry and other businesses that rely on low interest rates have shown particular weakness, and worries are rising about the strength of corporate profits broadly.

"45","How to read the Fed’s economic projections like a pro.","December 14, 2022 Wednesday 14:10 EST","BUSINESS",1059,"Jeanna Smialek","Federal Reserve officials will release fresh economic estimates at their meeting on Wednesday. Their projections for interest rates in 2023 will be in focus.","Federal Reserve officials will release fresh economic estimates at their meeting on Wednesday. Their projections for interest rates in 2023 will be in focus. Federal Reserve officials will release both an interest-rate decision and a fresh set of economic projections on Wednesday — estimates that Wall Street is keenly awaiting as investors try to understand what the next phase of the central bank’s ongoing fight against inflation will look like. Officials are widely expected to raise interest rates by half a point at this meeting, but what will be even more notable is what they forecast for interest rates in 2023 — and beyond. Central bankers have been shifting their focus away from how fast rates are rising and toward how high they will ultimately climb and how long they will remain elevated. Here’s how to read the numbers released on Wednesday. The dot plot, decoded When the central bank releases its Summary of Economic Projections each quarter, Fed watchers focus obsessively on one part in particular: the so-called dot plot. The dot plot shows the estimates by the Fed’s 19 policymakers for interest rates at the end of 2022, along with the next several years and over the longer run. The forecasts are represented by dots arranged along a vertical scale. Economists closely watch how the range of estimates is shifting, because it can give a hint to where policy is heading. Even so, they fixate most intently on the middle dot (currently the 10th). That middle, or median, official is regularly quoted as the clearest estimate of where the central bank sees policy heading. The Fed is trying to wrestle down rapid inflation, and to do that, officials believe that they need to lift interest rates enough to weigh down spending, crimp business investment and expansion, and cool off a hot job market. The central bank has moved rates up quickly in 2022, and expectations for future increases have also climbed. In June, the median official expected interest rates to close out the year at a range of 3.25 to 3.5 percent — instead, they’ll be set to a range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent if policymakers lift rates as much as expected on Wednesday. The median official expected rates to climb to 4.6 percent in 2023 as of the last rate projections in September, but that projection is expected to tick up slightly in the new release. Still, central bankers are likely to project that they are near the end of the road when it comes to raising interest rates. They have already done a lot to cool the economy, and they do not want to overdo it and crush growth and the labor market more than is necessary. The most important trick for reading this dot plot? Pay attention to where the numbers fall in relation to the longer-run median projection. That number is sometimes called the natural rate, and it most recently stood at 2.5 percent. It represents the theoretical dividing line between easy and restrictive monetary policy. The Fed can use the gap between the Fed funds rate and that so-called natural rate to signal how far they plan to go into economy-restricting territory — and also how long they will stay there. How long rates will stay elevated is a particularly important question at this moment. Unemployment projections will be key Is the Fed expecting a much-higher jobless rate as it tries to counter rapid inflation? Page 2 of the economic projections will hold some answers. The Fed has two jobs. It is supposed to achieve maximum employment and stable inflation. Unemployment has been very low, employers are hiring steadily, and wages have been rapid throughout 2022, so officials think that their full employment goal is more than satisfied. Inflation, on the other hand, is running at about three times their official target. Given that, the central bankers are now single-mindedly focused on bringing price gains back under control. But once the job market slows, joblessness begins to rise and wage growth moderates — a series of events officials think is necessary to getting back to slow and steady price gains — the difficult phase of the Fed’s maneuvering will begin. Central bankers will have to decide how much joblessness they are willing to tolerate, and may have to judge how to balance two goals that are in conflict. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has at times acknowledged that the adjustment process is likely to bring “pain” to businesses and households. The Fed’s updated unemployment rate projections will show how much he and his colleagues are prepared to tolerate. Watch the growth outlook The road toward higher unemployment is paved with slower growth. To force the job market to cool and inflation to moderate, Fed officials believe they have to drag economic growth below its potential level — and how much it is expected to drop can send a signal about how punishing the Fed thinks its policies will be. Many experts think that the economy is capable of a certain level of growth in any given year, based on fundamental characteristics like the age of its population and productivity of its companies. Right now, the Fed estimates that longer-run sustainable level to be about 1.8 percent, after adjusting for inflation. Last year, the economy was growing much more strongly than that — it began overheating. This year, growth was much weaker. The question is how tepid the Fed thinks it needs to be in 2023 to help policymakers achieve their inflation goal. Pro tip: Interpret inflation estimates cautiously The inflation estimates in the Fed’s projections typically do not offer a lot of insight. That’s because the Fed’s forecasts predict how the economy will shape up if central bankers set what they consider “appropriate” monetary policy. To qualify as “appropriate,” by definition, monetary policy must push price increases back toward the Fed’s 2 percent annual average goal over the course of a few years. That means Fed inflation forecasts always converge back toward the central bank’s goal in economic estimates. If there is a glimmer of utility here, it is how long the central bank sees it taking to wrestle prices back to its target level. As of September, Fed officials thought that core inflation — the figure that strips out food and fuel costs to get a sense of underlying price patterns — would remain at 2.1 percent in 2025. The upshot? It could be a long road back to normal, even in an ideal world."
"46","Bank of Japan Signals Surprise Move on Rates","December 21, 2022 Wednesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 6",718,"Ben Dooley",NA,"The adjustment to bond-buying policies was a rare move for the central bank, keen on helping the country battle rising inflation and a weak currency. This summer, when the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates to fight inflation, almost every central bank around the world raced to keep up. The Bank of Japan alone stood firm.    But on Tuesday, the central bank of the world's third-largest economy seemed to have a sudden change of heart, signaling that it could begin moving away from years of ultraloose policies aimed at spurring wages and prices higher.   The bank said it would loosen the tight limits it had imposed on bond yields, a move that could crack open the door for future interest rate increases. The change surprised investors in Asia who had been expecting the bank to make such a decision next year.   In a policy statement, the Bank of Japan said it would allow the yield on its 10-year bonds to move in a range of plus or minus 0.5 percent, broadening the band from 0.25 percent, as it seeks to promote trading of domestic bonds, which has stagnated. At the same time, the bank will increase its monthly bond purchases to $67 billion from around $55 billion, the statement said.   Analysts had predicted that Japan's central bank would hold fast to its current monetary settings through at least the spring, when its governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, will step down.   ''The consensus was entirely that the B.O.J. would stand pat,'' said Stefan Angrick, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics.   In its statement, the bank said it had made the change in light of deteriorating bond market conditions caused, in part, by ''volatility in overseas financial and capital markets.''   For years, the Bank of Japan has limited yields to a tight range to keep interest rates low, a policy it has incrementally loosened since its introduction in 2016. But in recent months the restrictions, maintained with enormous buying operations, had brought the trading of some government bonds to a near standstill.   The bank said its new policy change would help support the ultralow rates that had for years provided households and businesses with a steady flow of cheap money. One of the pillars of that policy -- near-zero interest rates -- will remain unchanged, the bank said in its statement.   In a news briefing after the statement's release, Mr. Kuroda said it was ''too early to consider reviewing or exiting'' its current easing policies.   Japan has felt the sting of skyrocketing food and energy prices because of supply chain snarls and the war in Ukraine. Inflation, while much lower than in other parts of the world, was at 3.6 percent in October, putting a substantial burden on households that became accustomed to decades of price stability and wage stagnation.   Making matters worse is a weak Japanese yen. Earlier this year, the currency traded at a decades-long low against the dollar, placing even more price pressure on the economy, which is heavily dependent on imports.   The yen's weakness has been exacerbated by the Bank of Japan's insistence on sticking to ultralow interest rates even as other central banks have precipitously raised their own in an effort to tamp down runaway inflation. The gap has put pressure on the yen as investors move money out of Japan in search of higher returns.   The currency has regained lost ground in recent weeks as other central banks have slowed their interest rate increases. It jumped in value after Tuesday's announcement, by more than 3 percent. A surge in the currency's value could help reduce inflationary pressures on the economy.   Mr. Kuroda has said he would stick to the bank's current rate policy until the bank achieved sustainable, demand-driven inflation of 2 percent, a level that policymakers argue would create a virtuous cycle of growing corporate profit and wages. While current levels have exceeded that target, the bank argues that the price increases are largely driven by supply constraints, not the heightened demand it aims to create.   In its statement, the bank said it would maintain its current inflation target until it could be maintained in a ''stable manner,'' adding that it would ''not hesitate to take additional easing measures, if necessary.''

"47","Another Drop Spurred by Fed's Intentions","December 17, 2022 Saturday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",570,"The Associated Press",NA,"Wall Street racked up more losses Friday, as worries mounted that the Federal Reserve and other central banks are willing to bring on a recession if that's what it takes to crush inflation. The S&P 500 fell 1.1 percent, its third straight drop. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 0.8 percent and the Nasdaq composite lost 1 percent. The major indexes marked their second straight weekly loss.    The pullback was broad. More than 80 percent of stocks in the benchmark S&P 500 fell. Technology and health care stocks were among the biggest weights on the market. Microsoft fell 1.7 percent and Pfizer slid 4.1 percent.   The Fed this week raised its forecast for how high it will ultimately take interest rates and tried to dash some investors' hopes that rate cuts may happen next year. In Europe, the central bank came off as even more aggressive in many investors' eyes.   ''Inflation continues to be the monster in the room,'' said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi.   Inflation has been easing from its hottest levels in decades, but remains high. That has prompted the Fed to maintain its aggressive attack on prices by raising interest rates to slow economic growth. The strategy increasingly risks slamming on the brakes too hard and sending an already slowing economy into a recession.   ''Whether it's a mild, medium, or deep recession is still unknown,'' Young said.   A mixed report from S&P Global highlighted the recession risk. It showed that business activity slowed more than expected this month as inflation squeezes companies. It also noted that it was the sharpest drop since May of 2020, but that inflation pressures have also been easing.   ''In short, the survey data suggest that Fed rate hikes are having the desired effect on inflation, but that the economic cost is building and recession risks are consequently mounting,'' Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said.   The S&P 500 fell 43.39 points to 3,852.36. It's now down about 19 percent this year. The Dow dropped 281.76 points to finish at 32,920.46. The Nasdaq slid 105.11 points to 10,705.41.   Small company stocks had more moderate losses than the broader market. The Russell 2000 fell 11.19 points, or 0.6. percent, to 1,763.42.   Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.48 percent from 3.45 percent late Thursday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which closely tracks expectations for Fed moves, fell to 4.21 percent from 4.24 percent late Thursday.   The Fed on Wednesday ended its final meeting of the year by raising its short-term interest rate by half a percentage point, its seventh straight increase this year. Wall Street had been hoping that the central bank would signal an easing of rate increases heading into 2023, but the Fed instead signaled the opposite.   The federal funds rate stands at a range of 4.25 percent to 4.5 percent, the highest in 15 years. Policymakers forecast that the central bank's rate will reach a range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the end of 2023. Their forecast doesn't call for a rate cut before 2024.   Several companies bucked the broader losses on Friday with strong financial results and forecasts. Software maker Adobe rose 3 percent after topping Wall Street's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings forecasts. United States Steel gained 5.8 percent after a strong earnings forecast. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/16/business/16markets-print.html  Graphic"

The index has fallen on eight of the past 10 full trading days. A gauge of wholesale prices rose more than expected on Friday, undercutting previous signs of inflation slowing down. The Producer Price Index rose by 0.3 percent in November, above the 0.2 percent expected by economists. For the year through November, the index rose by 7.4 percent, lower than October’s reading but still above expectations. The fresh data added to strong jobs numbers at the end of last week and better-than-expected survey data about business at services companies, highlighting the resilience of some parts of the economy in the face of the Fed’s relentless efforts to reduce inflation through higher interest rates. “I think there is a bit more realism creeping back into markets” that the process of lowering inflation will not be painless, said Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard. “The equity market still doesn’t fully reflect the challenges ahead.” Higher interest rates help slow economic activity by raising costs for consumers and companies, and investors had become hopeful that signs of slowing inflation could prompt the Fed to let up on the pace of increases. That helped push the stock market higher in recent weeks, leaving the S&amp;P more than 10 percent above its low in October, even after this week’s decline. Investors still expect the Fed to raise interest rates less aggressively starting at its meeting next week, but the concern is that the central bank could leave interest rates at high levels for an extended period, if inflation remains stubborn. That, in turn, raises the risk that the economy could tip into a recession. “As we speak to company management teams, clearly inflationary pressures are abating, from input costs to supply chain pressures, and in some cases demand and wages,” said Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. “However, that is not yet being reflected in the official inflation statistics, including this morning’s P.P.I. This may keep some pressure on the Fed to maintain higher policy rates and as a result will pressure equity prices in the near term.” Futures contracts that show how high traders think interest rates will rise by June next year climbed toward 5 percent this week, having fallen close to 4.9 percent by the end of last week. Rising short-term interest rates have also upended the usual order of the bond market, prompting one of Wall Street’s most widely watched recession indicators, known as an inverted yield curve. Typically, investors expect to be paid more interest for lending money for a longer period. But short-dated Treasury yields now sit well above longer-dated yields, as investors bet the Fed’s rate increases will prompt an economic downturn and force the central bank to eventually cut interest rates to help prop up an ailing economy. “The yield curve is sending you the message that the Fed is over-tightening,” said Luca Paolini, chief strategist at Pictet Asset Management. In another sign of slowing demand — though that is one more welcome to consumers who have struggled with soaring energy prices — U.S. gasoline prices fell below year-ago levels on Thursday, down sharply from the record highs reached in the summer. Energy prices have been an important driver of rising prices, so as they fall, investors are hopeful that broader-based measures of inflation will also decline. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the U.S. benchmark, also fell to its lowest level of the year on Thursday, crossing under $72 per barrel. On Friday, it fell by 0.6 percent, to $71.02 per barrel. Investors’ attention will now turn to next week, with an important update on consumer price inflation coming the day before the Fed’s next announcement on interest rates on Wednesday.

"50","Markets Mostly Lower in Muted Trading","December 28, 2022 Wednesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",601,"The Associated Press",NA,"Stocks closed lower Tuesday, adding to the market's recent losses as Wall Street counts down its final days of a painful year for investors. The S&P 500 fell 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq composite finished 1.4 percent lower. Both indexes were coming off their third straight weekly loss. The Dow Jones industrial average eked out a 0.1 percent gain.    Trading was mostly muted as U.S. markets reopened following the long holiday weekend. Markets in Asia and Europe mostly rose after China said it would drop nearly all Covid travel restrictions next month.   The move could ease some supply chain challenges for companies that source goods from China, but it could also lead to more spending by consumers there, which could fuel inflation, said Tom Hainlin, national investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.   ''Reopening seems to rekindle some inflationary concerns, where the Chinese consumer is kind of let back out and goes back to consuming,'' Mr. Hainlin said. ''Maybe that's adding to the inflation price pressures.''   Technology and communication services companies accounted for a big share of the decliners in the S&P 500. Apple fell 1.4 percent and Netflix lost 3.7 percent.   Airlines stocks fell broadly. A massive winter storm caused widespread delays and forced several carriers to cancel flights over the weekend. Delta Air Lines closed 0.8 percent lower, American Airlines dropped 1.4 percent and JetBlue slid 1.1 percent.   Southwest Airlines slid 6 percent after the company had to cancel roughly two-thirds of its flights over the last couple of days, which it blamed on problems related to staffing and weather. The federal government said it would investigate why the company lagged so far behind other carriers.   Tesla fell 11.4 percent for the biggest decline among S&P 500 stocks. The electric vehicle maker temporarily suspended production at a factory in Shanghai, according to published reports.   Energy stocks were the biggest gainers among S&P 500 companies. Hess added 1.2 percent.   Small company stocks also lost ground. The Russell 2000 index dropped 11.42 points, or 0.7 percent.   Treasury yields mostly rose as the U.S. bond market reopened. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.86 percent from 3.75 percent late Friday.   Trading on Wall Street is expected to be relatively light this holiday-shortened week as investors look ahead to 2023 after a dismal year for stocks.   Uncertainty about how far the Federal Reserve and other central banks would go to fight the highest inflation in decades has kept investors on edge. The Fed raised its key interest rate seven times this year and has signaled more hikes to come in 2023, even though the pace of price increases has been easing.   The high rates, which weigh heavily on prices for stocks and other investments, have fueled concerns that the economy could slow too much and slip into a recession next year.   The benchmark S&P 500 index set a record high at the beginning of January, but is now down nearly 20 percent for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is down nearly 34 percent.   Elsewhere around the world, shares mostly rose Tuesday after China announced it would relax more of its pandemic restrictions despite widespread outbreaks of Covid-19 that are straining its medical systems and disrupting business.   China's National Health Commission said Monday that passengers arriving from abroad will no longer have to observe a quarantine, starting Jan. 8.   They will still need a negative virus test within 48 hours of their departure and to wear masks on their flights. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/27/business/28markets.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."

The S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite closed 1.1 percent higher. The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.5 percent.    Major indexes are all in the red for the week and have been swinging between big monthly gains and losses throughout the year. Investors' worries about inflation, rising interest rates and recession risks have made for a volatile market. That has also left Wall Street focused on data points on the economy, especially those regarding inflation.   ''We'll continue to see outsized moves in the markets over the coming months,'' said Jeff Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ''We're going to be feeling our way through and there's going to be a lot of volatility.''   The S&P 500 rose 29.59 points to 3,963.51.

On Thursday, the United States reported that slightly more Americans filed for jobless claims last week, but not as many as economists had forecast. The labor market remains one of the strongest pockets of the economy, which has been stifled under the weight of inflation and rising interest rates.   Low unemployment is good for the broader economy but makes it more difficult for the Federal Reserve to tame inflation. The central bank has been raising interest rates to curb borrowing and spending in order to cool the most stubbornly hot inflation in decades. Its benchmark interest rate sits at 3.75 percent to 4 percent, the highest in 15 years.   The Fed will meet next week and is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point.   Resilient consumer spending, which is partly tied to strong employment, has also made the fight against inflation more difficult. It has been keeping the economy strong enough to stay out of a recession, analysts have said, but it is also increasing the chances that the Fed will go too far in raising interest rates. The Fed could potentially cause a recession by hitting the brakes too hard on the economy.   Wall Street will get more insight into how consumers feel about inflation and the economy on Friday when the University of Michigan releases its consumer sentiment survey for December. Investors will also get an update on how inflation is impacting businesses when the government releases its latest monthly report on wholesale prices Friday. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/business/stocks-rise-on-wall-street-but-remain-lower-for-the-week.html  Graphic"
"52","A Surprise From Japan Upends Markets","December 21, 2022 Wednesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",599,"The Associated Press",NA,"Stocks closed modestly higher on Wall Street, while bond markets around the world felt pain Tuesday after a surprise move from Japan's central bank cranked up the pressure on an already slowing global economy. The S&P 500 rose 0.1 percent after flipping between small losses and gains in the early going. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq composite barely budged after closing less than 0.1 percent higher. Small company stocks outdid the broader market, lifting the Russell 2000 index 0.5 percent higher.    The muted gains were enough to end a four-day losing streak for the major indexes.   The biggest action was in the bond market, where yields pushed higher after Japan, one of the world's last bastions of super-low and economy-aiding interest rates, made moves that could allow rates to climb more than otherwise.   The Bank of Japan said Tuesday it still wants the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds to remain at roughly zero, but it also said it would allow the yield to move up to 0.50 percent instead of the 0.25 percent cap it had held previously. What made Tokyo's unexpected move a particular jolt was how much resistance it's shown so far in joining the global campaign to hike rates in order to undercut high inflation.   Aftershocks from the Bank of Japan's move on Tuesday rippled through bond and currency markets around the world.   In the U.S., the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.68 percent from 3.59 percent late Monday. That yield helps set rates for mortgages and other economy-setting loans, which has already meant particular pain for the U.S. housing market.   The two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which tends to more closely track expectations for action from the Federal Reserve, was more reserved. It held steady at 4.26 percent.   In the foreign exchange market, Tokyo's surprise move sent the value of the Japanese yen climbing against the U.S. dollar, which gave back some of its huge gains over the past year. The dollar fell to 131.50 Japanese yen, down 4 percent from a day earlier.   The Nikkei 225 index of Japanese stocks also fell 2.5 percent.   Stocks worldwide have been under pressure the entire year on worries about high inflation, higher interest rates and a weakening economy.   ''Markets continue to play the back-and-forth between inflation and concerns about Fed policy and growth,'' said Zachary Hill, head of portfolio management at Horizon Investments.   Investors have been trying to push markets higher every time it seems that inflation is easing and every time they ''run into the simple fact that the Fed needs to tighten financial conditions to slow down the economy,'' Mr. Hill said.   On Wall Street, the Bank of Japan's move had less of an impact on stocks.   ''It was a surprise, a very unexpected move, but on its own it's probably not enough to really be a risk-off event for markets,'' said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird.   Energy sector stocks led the S&P 500's gains as the price of U.S. oil settled 1.2 percent higher. Halliburton stock climbed 3.8 percent, and Schlumberger stock rose 3.9 percent.   Communications, technology and banks also rose. Shares of the Facebook parent Meta Platforms gained 2.3 percent, Adobe stock rose 2.9 percent and Charles Schwab stock added 1.7 percent. Tesla was the S&P 500's biggest decliner: Its shares slid 8.1 percent.   A report on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilders broke ground on fewer homes for a third straight month in November.

"53","Retail Sales Fell in November, Despite Black Friday","December 15, 2022 Thursday 23:08 EST","BUSINESS",1079,"Jordyn Holman","Inflation changed the way U.S. shoppers approached the holiday season, while lower gas prices and a decline in car sales were also factors.","Inflation changed the way U.S. shoppers approached the holiday season, while lower gas prices and a decline in car sales were also factors. Retail sales fell in November, with spending on even traditionally popular gift categories like clothing and sporting goods declining, a sign that high prices for necessities like food are affecting how people approach the holiday shopping season. U.S. retail sales fell 0.6 percent in November from October, the Department of Commerce said on Thursday. The figure does not account for price changes, and inflation did ease slightly during the month. Spending increased in some areas, including at grocery stores, health and personal care stores and restaurants and bars. But categories like motor vehicles, furniture, consumer electronics, clothing and sporting goods all declined. Gas prices also fell during the month, meaning consumers spent less money filling up their cars. “Overall, the demand patterns — not the most academic term — have been out of whack for the past few years and what we’re seeing is these disruptions coming back in these forms,” said Andrew Forman, who studies consumer behavior at Hofstra University’s Frank G. Zarb School of Business. “There are so many moving factors.” Inflation in November slowed to 7.1 percent through the year, down from 7.7 percent in October. Some analysts pointed out that lower prices affected the retail sales figure. “Less inflation is driving some of that decline from October to November, which wouldn’t be a bad thing,” David Silverman, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said. In many ways, the report highlights how inflation, even if it has eased, has changed the way consumers are approaching the holiday season. Americans, for example, are whittling down the number of people they are giving gifts to, according to data from KPMG. “Those are some signs that those core categories are just taking quite a bit of our budget away and we can only do so much during the holiday season,” Matt Kramer, KPMG’s consumer and retail national sector leader, said. Grocery stores posted a 0.8 increase in sales from the previous month. Sales at health and personal care stores increased 0.7 percent. Restaurants and bars saw a 0.9 bump. Sales at gas stations fell 0.1 percent, whiles purchases at motor vehicle and auto parts dealers declined 2.3 percent. November marked the official start of the holiday shopping season. Nearly 200 millionAmericans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, which included Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group. The average amount that shoppers spent that weekend was more than $325, the group said, up 8 percent from last year. In reality, though, the holiday shopping season began long before Black Friday. In recent months, retailers have been advertising more discounts to sell excess inventory and entice people to spend as early in the year as possible. By securing those early holiday sales, the calculation went, retailers could avoid consumers’ increasing concerns about a possible recession in the new year. The average sales discount for Black Friday deals was 30 percent, according to Salesforce. That was slightly more than the average discount rate of 29 percent in 2021. Many experts say the earlier-than-usual deals were reflected in the October retail sales figures, when sales rose 1.3 percent from September. “Price discounting by retailers overloaded with inventory during the all-important holiday shopping season likely pushed sales lower, as did lower gasoline prices,” Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note. The shift to services and experiences may also be playing a role, Mr. Kramer said. More money this holiday season could be spent on travel that couldn’t happen during the pandemic. Consumers may also be feeling shopping fatigue after having spent money on all manner of items earlier in the pandemic. After two years of significant spending and robust holiday shopping seasons, retailers are up against tough sales comparisons, Mr. Silverman said. Despite the decline from the previous month, retail sales in November were up 6.5 percent from a year earlier. “I prefer to see the full dynamics of the season,” Mr. Silverman said. “I think that gifting could take the form of tickets to something. It could also take the form of gift cards — those don’t count as retail sales until they’re spent. Those dynamics do come into play as well.” Inflation, which Americans have been experiencing most of this year, is shaping up to become the defining factor for the holiday shopping season. Many of the same patterns that played out in November, such as shoppers’ concerns about the economy, are likely to remain in the final weeks of the year. “The ability to spend is impacted by inflation and they’re trying to change that mix in their basket to make up the difference between what they earn and take home every month and what things cost,” said Matt Shay, N.R.F.’s president and chief executive officer. Mr. Shay noted that spending has been supported by a strong labor market, rising wages and “some households increasingly taking on additional debt or tapping into savings to help meet those monthly expense increases.” Still there is a question of what demand will look like in December. Since retailers used sales to entice shoppers to start their holiday spending while many of them were still carrying Halloween merchandise, consumers may be less inclined to spend in the weeks leading up to Christmas. Retail executives have said they recognized this dynamic and were planning to offer even more discounts as the holiday approached. “We think that individual company execution has become much more important as retail sales slow down somewhat,” Mr. Silverman said. Retail holiday sales last year were up 14.1 percent from 2020, according to N.R.F. The expectations this year are more temperate. N.R.F. said it expected holiday retail sales from November to December to increase 6 to 8 percent compared with last year. “I think it’s still going to be a solid year,” Mr. Kramer said. “I do think the consumers will be out but there’s only so much budget to go around and there won’t be these huge jumps like we saw last year.”"

The S&P 500 fell 1.4 percent, its fourth straight drop. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1 percent and the Nasdaq composite lost 2 percent.    Technology stocks, communication companies and retailers had some of the biggest losses. Apple fell 2.5 percent, Disney slid 3.8 percent and AutoZone dropped 2.8 percent.   Small company stocks also fell, pulling the Russell 2000 index 1.5 percent lower. The major indexes are on pace for a weekly loss after posting two straight weekly gains.   Bond yields fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slid to 3.52 percent from 3.58 percent late Monday.   European markets ended mostly lower and Asian markets closed mixed.   Several companies made big moves following financial updates and buyout announcements.   The utility NRG Energy slumped 15.1 percent after announcing it is spending $2.8 billion in cash and assuming $2.4 billion in debt to buy Vivint Smart Home.   Shares of the jewelry company Signet vaulted 20.2 percent after the company raised its profit and revenue forecasts for the year.   Roughly 80 percent of stocks in the S&P 500 fell, leaving the benchmark index down 57.58 points to 3,941.26. The Dow dropped 350.76 points to 33,596.34, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 225.05 points to close at 11,014.89.   The Russell 2000 slid 27.65 points to 1,812.58.   The broader market's dip came a day after stocks pulled back as stronger-than-expected readings on the economy raised worries that the Fed has a ways to go in getting inflation under control. The Fed is doing that by intentionally slowing the economy with higher interest rates.   ''We've been in this period where investors have been anticipating now that the Fed will back off pretty soon, they'll pause soon and probably even start cutting rates in the back half of 2023,'' said Bill Merz, head of capital market research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.   ''And then when we get the occasional robust jobs report and inflation report that makes it clear that inflation remains quite problematic and it's not decelerating as quickly as anyone would like,'' Merz said.   Investors are closely watching economic data and company announcements to get a better sense of how the economy is handling stubbornly hot inflation. They are also trying to determine whether inflation is easing at a pace that will allow the Fed to ease up on interest rate increases. The Fed's policy risks hitting the brakes on the economy too hard and sending it into a recession.   The Fed is meeting next week and is expected to raise interest rates by a half-percentage point. It has raised its benchmark rate six times since March, driving it to a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent, the highest in 15 years. Wall Street expects the benchmark rate to reach a peak range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the middle of 2023.   Wall Street will get a weekly update on unemployment claims on Thursday. The job market has been one of the stronger pockets in the economy.   Investors will get important updates on inflation and how consumers are dealing with high prices later in the week.   On Friday, the government will release its November report on producer prices. That will give investors more insight into how inflation is impacting businesses.   The University of Michigan will release its December survey on consumer sentiment on Friday.

"55","Working on the Fine Print for E.V. Tax Credits","December 30, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1696,"Jack Ewing",NA,"Foreign-made cars no longer qualify. General Motors should become eligible again. But officials are still working on the fine print. Next year could be confusing for anyone shopping for an electric car.    A law that takes effect on Jan. 1 will both expand and scramble the list of vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits of up to $7,500 in ways that officials and carmakers are still trying to sort out.   The Biden administration on Thursday put out a new list of cars that will qualify for the credits. That list, which included models from Ford Motor, Nissan, Rivian, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Tesla and Volvo, is not complete, and the Treasury Department said it would be added to ''over the coming days and weeks.''   Although they were not included on the list, models from General Motors, which had exceeded a cap on the number of cars that could collect subsidies under an older law, are expected to be eligible again in January because the new law, the Inflation Reduction Act, abolishes the cap. But imported cars that qualified under the old law will no longer be eligible; these include vehicles made by brands like Hyundai and Kia.   Even when the list published on Thursday is complete, it might be good for only three months or so because officials plan to carry out other parts of the law in March. That is when the Biden administration plans to put in place new rules intended to force carmakers to buy batteries and raw materials from suppliers in the United States and its trade allies. Very few if any electric cars might qualify right away after those rules go into effect, auto experts said.   The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in August, was designed to promote battery-powered vehicles while providing incentives for companies to make them in North America. It is also designed to exclude rivals like China and Russia from the supply chain.   But the details of how to apply those principles were left to the Treasury, which has had only four months to work through scores of brain-numbing technical details not fully addressed in the legislation.   For example, for a vehicle to qualify for credits, at least 40 percent of the minerals in its battery, measured by their value, must come from the United States or a trade ally. The quota rises in steps to 80 percent in 2027. But it is devilishly difficult to track the origin of raw materials. And the law didn't specify which countries should be considered trade allies.   A preliminary list issued by the Treasury on Thursday includes countries like Chile, Nicaragua and Singapore because they have trade agreements with the United States. But it excludes the European Union,  with which the United States does not have a trade pact. (Officials left open the possibility that countries could be added to the list later.)   Federal regulators face a dilemma. If they interpret the law too strictly, carmakers may not even try to qualify for the credits. If they interpret the law too liberally, it might not achieve one of its key aims -- to compel carmakers to create jobs in the United States and pivot supply chains away from China or other geopolitical adversaries.   China dominates the processing of battery raw materials like lithium and graphite, and it controls mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the source of most of the world's cobalt, an essential battery ingredient.   Since August, only cars assembled in the United States, Canada or Mexico have been eligible for the full credit of $7,500. On Jan. 1, the law abolishes a limit of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer under an older law.   After March, or whenever the Treasury Department decides how to enforce the limitations on imported battery minerals and battery components, the rules will get a lot tougher. It's possible that no vehicles will qualify immediately.   In other words, car buyers might have a brief window -- from January to March -- to collect the full credit. Then they will have to wait months or years for mines to begin producing ore in friendly countries, refineries to be built and domestic battery assembly lines to start rolling, analysts say.   Pablo Di Si, the chief executive of Volkswagen of America, which builds electric vehicles in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Mexico, has pleaded for automakers to be given a few years to adapt. ''When you have an industry that has been disrupted the way we have been disrupted,'' he said in an interview, ''you cannot make these sudden changes in technology, in production, in mineral extraction.''   It is considered unlikely that Congress will revise the law, given that Republicans will soon control the House. Even with Democratic control of both houses, the Inflation Reduction Act passed only after the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, made major concessions to Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who had initially joined Republicans in opposing it.   But it appears that the Treasury will try to give carmakers and buyers a break by interpreting the law flexibly. For example, a battery component that is assembled in the United States, Canada or Mexico will probably pass muster even if it is made from imported parts, the Treasury Department said Wednesday in a preliminary report.   Some aspects of the law are fairly clear. Well-heeled car buyers -- defined as those whose modified adjusted gross income on their tax returns is $150,000 for individuals and $300,000 for couples -- won't be able to claim credits.   Sport utility vehicles, vans and pickups are eligible for credits only if the manufacturer's suggested list price is less than $80,000. For sedans and other vehicles, the price cap is $55,000. For plug-in hybrids, the size of the tax credit depends on battery size, at least until March.   That means pricey electric vehicles from companies like Mercedes-Benz and Lucid will probably not qualify even though they are made in the United States. Either their sticker prices are too high or their customers are too rich.   How to classify vehicles is another issue. Officials are likely to define an S.U.V. more narrowly than carmakers' marketing departments do.   There is a loophole in the law that could provide a way for consumers to take advantage of the credits even for vehicles that don't meet domestic sourcing requirements.   The act exempts commercial vehicles from the mineral and battery sourcing quotas, and the requirement that vehicles be made in North America. Auto industry lobbyists want the administration to interpret that provision to mean that cars purchased by leasing companies are commercial vehicles.   If that argument flies, and the Treasury Department indicated Thursday that it will, rental companies, ride-share services and leasing companies could collect credits on imported vehicles or those with foreign parts and pass the savings on to their customers.   The loophole angered Mr. Manchin, who on Thursday accused the Biden administration of bending to industry pressure and undermining policies designed to ''bring our energy and manufacturing supply chains onshore to protect our national security, reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries and create jobs right here in the United States.''   Mr. Manchin said he would introduce legislation that ''prevents this dangerous interpretation from Treasury from moving forward.''   The exception for leasing companies may help mollify Asian and European allies who have complained the Inflation Reduction Act discriminates against their carmakers. South Korean leaders are particularly aggrieved.   South Korea is a close military ally of the United States, and Hyundai is investing $5.5 billion to build batteries and electric vehicles in Georgia. But the plant, which will employ 8,000 people, won't begin mass-producing vehicles until 2025.   Until then, the rules are a blow to Hyundai's ambitions in the United States, where its Ioniq 5 has been a very popular electric model. During the first nine months of the year, Hyundai and its sister brand Kia had almost 8 percent of the U.S. electric vehicle market, second only to Tesla, which had a commanding 64 percent, according to Kelley Blue Book. Hyundai has asked that its vehicles qualify for credits until the Georgia operation is up and running, but it appears unlikely that U.S. officials will grant that request.   For the first time, used electric vehicles will be eligible for credits of up to $4,000. There are restrictions. The credit applies only to vehicles sold for less than $25,000 that are at least two years old. Buyers can't earn more than $150,000 if they file taxes as a married couple, and no more than $75,000 if they file singly. The credit applies to a vehicle just once, and buyers can't claim a credit more than once every three years.   Still, the credit means that electric vehicles ought to be more accessible to middle-income buyers. ''It has the potential to transform the way the used-car industry works,'' said Scott Case, chief executive of Recurrent, a firm that tracks the used electric vehicle market.   For buyers confused by all these new rules, there will be ways to know whether vehicles they're considering will be eligible for the tax credits. Recurrent's website allows buyers to type in a vehicle identification number and find out whether a used car is eligible.   One way that buyers can ensure that they'll receive the credit is to insist that dealers apply it to the purchase price. That was not allowed under the old rules but will be possible beginning in 2024. The change will help people whose taxes are too low to claim the full credit.   For all their complaints about the way the Inflation Reduction Act was written, carmakers generally like the legislation. Speaking to investors in October, Jim Farley, the chief executive of Ford, noted that the law contained subsidies for battery production that were separate from the tax credits for car buyers that could be worth $7 billion for the company and its suppliers through 2026. Those subsidies should help reduce electric vehicle prices.   The Inflation Reduction Act, Mr. Farley said, will ''have a wide range of positive impacts for both our customers and for Ford.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/29/business/electric-vehicles-tax-credit.html  Graphic"

Stocks sank on Friday, dragging markets lower at the end of a gloomy week. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.1 percent, adding to the steep loss in the previous day’s session and eroding gains from Monday and Tuesday. The slide took the week’s drop to over 2 percent, and marked the first time the S&amp;P has fallen for two consecutive weeks since September. The benchmark index is down over 19 percent for the year. Wall Street has been wary of the effects that central bankers’ determination to fight inflation could have on the economy. This week, officials at the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England raised interest rates again and said they were committed to keep tightening their policies until high prices come under control.  The yield on the two-year U.S. Treasury note remains well above that of the 10-year equivalent, a so-called inverted yield curve that many consider a reliable sign of a recession. On Friday, one of the Fed’s highest-ranking officials said that the central bank was getting closer to a sufficiently high interest rate setting. “We’re well on our way there,” John Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said on Bloomberg Television. “We’re getting to a better place.” Elsewhere, the Stoxx 600 in Europe fell by about 1.3 percent and the FTSE 100 in London fell by 1.3 percent.

"57","Fed Signals It May Slow Increases to Interest Rate","December 1, 2022 Thursday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1179,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"The Federal Reserve chair said the central bank would keep lifting rates to control price increases, and played down a recent cooling in inflation. Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, signaled on Wednesday that the central bank could slow its rapid pace of interest rate increases at its December meeting while making clear that borrowing costs have farther to climb as policymakers remain concerned about a sustained bout of inflation.    Investors cheered his comments, with stocks surging at the mere hint that the Fed's supersize rate increases could soon taper off even as Mr. Powell underlined that he and his colleagues were focused on raising rates high enough to tame inflation, rather than on how fast they got there.   The S&P 500 climbed more than 3 percent, the index's best day in over two weeks. The Nasdaq composite index, which is particularly sensitive to changing views on interest rates, rose 4.4 percent.   The Fed has lifted interest rates from near zero as recently as March to a range of 3.75 to 4 percent at its meeting this month. Its past four rate moves have come in three-quarter-point increments -- huge adjustments, the likes of which the Fed had not made since 1994. Central bankers have been clear that they think it would be wise to slow the pace soon, and Mr. Powell locked in market expectations for a half-point move at the central bank's Dec. 13-14 meeting.   ''The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting,'' Mr. Powell said during a speech at the Brookings Institution in Washington.   Moving less quickly would allow the Fed to keep up its battle against the most rapid inflation in decades while giving policymakers more time to see how the substantial rate moves they had already made were playing out. While interest rate changes work promptly to slow the housing market, the full effect can take months or years to flow through the economy.   If Fed officials raise rates too much and realize their mistake belatedly, they could cost Americans jobs and put the economy through a rough recession that is deeper than what is necessary to control inflation. That is something officials want to avoid.   ''My colleagues and I do not want to over-tighten,'' Mr. Powell said, referring to rate increases that tighten the flow of money too much. ''Cutting rates is not something we want to do soon. So that's why we're slowing down, and going to try to find our way to what that right level is.''   Still, Mr. Powell and his colleagues are trying to strike a balance. Even as they lay the groundwork to imminently slow down, they want to make it clear that they are not giving up on their campaign against rapid price increases.   If investors believe that the Fed is dialing back its plans, and asset prices rise in a sign of relief, money could become cheaper and easier to borrow, undoing some of the monetary restraint that the central bank has ushered in -- and making inflation even harder to vanquish. Wednesday's market moves highlighted that challenge.   As they try to demonstrate their continued commitment to bringing inflation under control, officials have also been trying to shift the focus to how much more rates have to climb and how long borrowing costs are kept high enough to restrain the economy.   ''It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time,'' Mr. Powell said.   Though the Fed chair acknowledged that inflation had recently shown hopeful signs of slowing, he warned against reading too much into one month of data. He emphasized that wage growth remained too rapid to allow price increases to ease back to the Fed's 2 percent annual goal. Given that, he repeatedly stressed that central bankers would need to keep lifting interest rates -- probably by more than they had predicted as recently as September -- to ensure that they returned price increases to normal.   ''We will stay the course until the job is done,'' he said.   Mr. Powell was not alone in sending that message. His colleagues across the Fed system have been emphasizing that they have more to do in cooling the economy and helping inflation to come down.   ''Consumer spending has remained resilient'' and is ''supported by labor income growth and still elevated savings,'' Lisa D. Cook, a Fed governor, said during a speech in Michigan on Wednesday. ''How far we go, and how long we keep rates restrictive, will depend on observed progress in bringing down inflation.''   The road to slower inflation could be a long one. Mr. Powell pushed back on any notion that a recent moderation in price increases is a sure sign that price jumps will return to more acceptable levels soon.   ''Down months in the data have often been followed by renewed increases,'' he said. And while many economists expect inflation to moderate next year, ''forecasts have been predicting just such a decline for more than a year, while inflation has moved stubbornly sideways.''   Mr. Powell also pointed out that even if goods prices weigh on inflation and rent growth moderates next year as economists expect, the job market remains very tight -- and signs of slowing so far are not conclusive.   That could help keep inflation elevated. When employers are paying more in wages, they are likely to try to pass those climbing labor costs on to their customers by raising prices. The Employment Cost Index, a quarterly measure of wages and benefits, is climbing 5 percent on a yearly basis. That is far faster than the roughly 2.2 percent that was normal in the years leading up to the pandemic.   ''We want wages to go up strongly, but they've got to go up at a level that is consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,'' Mr. Powell said. ''You're 1.5 or 2 percent above that with current wage increases.''   The Fed will receive further information on the labor market and inflation before its next monetary policy meeting. A fresh inflation report that the central bank watches closely is set for release on Thursday, and the November jobs report will be out on Friday.   How the economy shapes up in the months ahead is likely to inform how high rates have to go next year -- and whether the Fed can achieve what officials often refer to as a ''soft landing,'' in which the labor market comes back into balance and inflation slows without a major spike in the jobless rate.   Mr. Powell said he still saw a path to a soft landing, though it could be narrow if the Fed has to leave interest rates high for a longer period to wrangle inflation.   With price increases showing hopeful signs of pulling back, some commentators have warned that the Fed risks overdoing it, threatening the health of the labor market and possibly global upheaval. On Wednesday, Mr. Powell pushed back on such criticism.   ''We don't think the world is going to be a better place if we take our time and inflation becomes entrenched,'' Mr. Powell said, noting that a later but more aggressive response could hurt even worse. ''The world will be better off if we can get this over quickly.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/30/business/powell-fed-interest-rates-speech.html  Graphic"
"58","Retail Sales Fell in November Despite Black Friday Deals","December 16, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 5",1056,"Jordyn Holman",NA,"Inflation changed the way U.S. shoppers approached the holiday season, while lower gas prices and a decline in car sales were also factors. Retail sales fell in November, with spending on even traditionally popular gift categories like clothing and sporting goods declining, a sign that high prices for necessities like food are affecting how people approach the holiday shopping season.    U.S. retail sales fell 0.6 percent in November from October, the Department of Commerce said on Thursday. The figure does not account for price changes, and inflation did ease slightly during the month.   Spending increased in some areas, including at grocery stores, health and personal care stores and restaurants and bars. But categories like motor vehicles, furniture, consumer electronics, clothing and sporting goods all declined. Gas prices also fell during the month, meaning consumers spent less money filling up their cars.   ''Overall, the demand patterns -- not the most academic term -- have been out of whack for the past few years and what we're seeing is these disruptions coming back in these forms,'' said Andrew Forman, who studies consumer behavior at Hofstra University's Frank G. Zarb School of Business. ''There are so many moving factors.''   Inflation in November slowed to 7.1 percent through the year, down from 7.7 percent in October. Some analysts pointed out that lower prices affected the retail sales figure.   ''Less inflation is driving some of that decline from October to November, which wouldn't be a bad thing,'' David Silverman, a senior director at Fitch Ratings, said.   In many ways, the report highlights how inflation, even if it has eased, has changed the way consumers are approaching the holiday season. Americans, for example, are whittling down the number of people they are giving gifts to, according to data from KPMG.   ''Those are some signs that those core categories are just taking quite a bit of our budget away and we can only do so much during the holiday season,'' Matt Kramer, KPMG's consumer and retail national sector leader, said.   Grocery stores posted a 0.8 increase in sales from the previous month. Sales at health and personal care stores increased 0.7 percent. Restaurants and bars saw a 0.9 bump. Sales at gas stations fell 0.1 percent, whiles purchases at motor vehicle and auto parts dealers declined 2.3 percent.   November marked the official start of the holiday shopping season. Nearly 200 million Americans shopped during the Thanksgiving weekend, which included Black Friday and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation, an industry trade group. The average amount that shoppers spent that weekend was more than $325, the group said, up 8 percent from last year.   In reality, though, the holiday shopping season began long before Black Friday. In recent months, retailers have been advertising more discounts to sell excess inventory and entice people to spend as early in the year as possible. By securing those early holiday sales, the calculation went, retailers could avoid consumers' increasing concerns about a possible recession in the new year.   The average sales discount for Black Friday deals was 30 percent, according to Salesforce. That was slightly more than the average discount rate of 29 percent in 2021.   Many experts say the earlier-than-usual deals were reflected in the October retail sales figures, when sales rose 1.3 percent from September.    ''Price discounting by retailers overloaded with inventory during the all-important holiday shopping season likely pushed sales lower, as did lower gasoline prices,'' Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note.   The shift to services and experiences may also be playing a role, Mr. Kramer said. More money this holiday season could be spent on travel that couldn't happen during the pandemic.   Consumers may also be feeling shopping fatigue after having spent money on all manner of items earlier in the pandemic. After two years of significant spending and robust holiday shopping seasons, retailers are up against tough sales comparisons, Mr. Silverman said. Despite the decline from the previous month, retail sales in November were up 6.5 percent from a year earlier.   ''I prefer to see the full dynamics of the season,'' Mr. Silverman said. ''I think that gifting could take the form of tickets to something. It could also take the form of gift cards -- those don't count as retail sales until they're spent. Those dynamics do come into play as well.''   Inflation, which Americans have been experiencing most of this year, is shaping up to become the defining factor for the holiday shopping season. Many of the same patterns that played out in November, such as shoppers' concerns about the economy, are likely to remain in the final weeks of the year.   ''The ability to spend is impacted by inflation and they're trying to change that mix in their basket to make up the difference between what they earn and take home every month and what things cost,'' said Matt Shay, N.R.F.'s president and chief executive officer.   Mr. Shay noted that spending has been supported by a strong labor market, rising wages and ''some households increasingly taking on additional debt or tapping into savings to help meet those monthly expense increases.''   Still there is a question of what demand will look like in December. Since retailers used sales to entice shoppers to start their holiday spending while many of them were still carrying Halloween merchandise, consumers may be less inclined to spend in the weeks leading up to Christmas.   Retail executives have said they recognized this dynamic and were planning to offer even more discounts as the holiday approached.   ''We think that individual company execution has become much more important as retail sales slow down somewhat,'' Mr. Silverman said.   Retail holiday sales last year were up 14.1 percent from 2020, according to N.R.F. The expectations this year are more temperate. N.R.F. said it expected holiday retail sales from November to December to increase 6 to 8 percent compared with last year.   ''I think it's still going to be a solid year,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''I do think the consumers will be out but there's only so much budget to go around and there won't be these huge jumps like we saw last year.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/business/retail-sales-november.html  Graphic"

General Motors should become eligible again. But officials are still working on the fine print.","Foreign-made cars no longer qualify. General Motors should become eligible again. But officials are still working on the fine print. Next year could be confusing for anyone shopping for an electric car. A law that takes effect on Jan. 1 will both expand and scramble the list of vehicles that qualify for federal tax credits of up to $7,500 in ways that officials and carmakers are still trying to sort out. The Biden administration on Thursday put out a new list of cars that will qualify for the credits. That list, which included models from Ford Motor, Nissan, Rivian, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Tesla and Volvo, is not complete, and the Treasury Department said it would be added to “over the coming days and weeks.” Although they were not included on the list, models from General Motors, which had exceeded a cap on the number of cars that could collect subsidies under an older law, are expected to be eligible again in January because the new law, the Inflation Reduction Act, abolishes the cap. But imported cars that qualified under the old law will no longer be eligible; these include vehicles made by brands like Hyundai and Kia. Even when the list published on Thursday is complete, it might be good for only three months or so because officials plan to carry out other parts of the law in March. That is when the Biden administration plans to put in place new rules intended to force carmakers to buy batteries and raw materials from suppliers in the United States and its trade allies. Very few if any electric cars might qualify right away after those rules go into effect, auto experts said. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed into law by President Biden in August, was designed to promote battery-powered vehicles while providing incentives for companies to make them in North America. It is also designed to exclude rivals like China and Russia from the supply chain. But the details of how to apply those principles were left to the Treasury, which has had only four months to work through scores of brain-numbing technical details not fully addressed in the legislation. For example, for a vehicle to qualify for credits, at least 40 percent of the minerals in its battery, measured by their value, must come from the United States or a trade ally. The quota rises in steps to 80 percent in 2027. But it is devilishly difficult to track the origin of raw materials. And the law didn’t specify which countries should be considered trade allies. A preliminary list issued by the Treasury on Thursday includes countries like Chile, Nicaragua and Singapore because they have trade agreements with the United States. But it excludes the European Union,  with which the United States does not have a trade pact. (Officials left open the possibility that countries could be added to the list later.) Federal regulators face a dilemma. If they interpret the law too strictly, carmakers may not even try to qualify for the credits. If they interpret the law too liberally, it might not achieve one of its key aims — to compel carmakers to create jobs in the United States and pivot supply chains away from China or other geopolitical adversaries. China dominates the processing of battery raw materials like lithium and graphite, and it controls mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the source of most of the world’s cobalt, an essential battery ingredient. Since August, only cars assembled in the United States, Canada or Mexico have been eligible for the full credit of $7,500. On Jan. 1, the law abolishes a limit of 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer under an older law. After March, or whenever the Treasury Department decides how to enforce the limitations on imported battery minerals and battery components, the rules will get a lot tougher. It’s possible that no vehicles will qualify immediately. In other words, car buyers might have a brief window — from January to March — to collect the full credit.

Americans continued spending in October, with personal consumption expenditures picking up even after adjusting for inflation, new data released Thursday showed. Consumption climbed 0.8 percent in October compared with the prior month, up from a previous gain of 0.6 percent. Adjusted for inflation, spending climbed by 0.5 percent. While economists expected those gains, they underscore that consumers remain resilient in the face of rapid price increases and rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has lifted borrowing costs at the most aggressive pace since the 1980s this year, making it more expensive to borrow on a credit card or to buy a car. Despite that, Americans continue to open their wallets. More recent anecdotal data suggest that the holiday shopping season is off to a strong start: Retail sales over the Thanksgiving weekend were up 10.9 percent from the prior year, excluding cars and not adjusting for inflation, based on Mastercard data. But people are also becoming more price sensitive as their savings run down and expensive food and gas weigh on family budgets, and stores have begun to discount products again to lure and retain customers. That could help to lower inflation, if it is drastic enough and continues. Americans are being buoyed in part by a strong labor market that is helping them to take home more money, and by one-time payments from states, some of which have stimulus money left to disperse or are benefiting from strong tax receipts. Personal income rose by 0.7 percent in October, and 0.4 percent after adjusting for inflation, Thursday’s data showed. That was the biggest inflation-adjusted increase since July. Personal income includes government social benefits, which helped to boost it this month, “primarily reflecting one-time refundable tax credits issued by states,” the Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its release."

WASHINGTON — President Biden is overseeing the sort of labor market that, by most measures, any White House would celebrate. Unemployment remains near a half-century low, the Labor Department reported on Friday. As it recovers steep pandemic losses, the economy has already added more jobs through November than in any other year on record, except for 2021, Mr. Biden’s first in office. The president cheered those numbers on Friday: “We continue to create jobs — lots of jobs,” he told reporters before signing a bill to avert a nationwide rail strike. “We’re in a situation where things are moving — moving in the right direction.” But for the Federal Reserve, the report offered little to celebrate. Officials have been waiting for hiring and wage growth to slow, paving the way for a more balanced economy where inflation, which is running near a 40-year high, can return to normal. Instead, both have remained resiliently strong even as the early effects of the Fed’s rapid 2022 interest rate increases begin to play out. “In the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech this week. Officials are looking for “the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.” That divide — between whether strong job gains should be seen as good news for workers or bad news for inflation — underscores the unique challenges that lie ahead for the economy and the White House next year. The president has consistently preached cautious optimism about the economy, even as inflation has stubbornly defied his administration’s predictions that it would soon moderate. “We are seeing initial signs that we are making progress in tackling inflation, even as we make the transition to more steady, stable economic growth,” Mr. Biden said in a news release on Thursday, before the jobs numbers were released. “That’s good news for the American people, and further evidence that my economic plan is working.” The jobs report in some ways supported his sunny take. Employers added 263,000 jobs in November, continuing to provide the backbone of administration claims that the recovery is on track. In a background call with reporters on Thursday, administration economic officials emphasized that recent data, including consumer spending figures and current measures of quarterly growth, continue to show the U.S. economy holding up far better than comparable wealthy nations around the world. Administration aides have also expressed a rising confidence that still-high inflation could, finally, be trending toward historically normal levels. Yet the same resilience that is giving the Biden administration positive talking points today could create trouble later on if it makes it harder for the Fed to stamp out rapid inflation. Consumer Price Index data show that inflation has begun to moderate, but it remains far faster than the Fed’s goal: It was running at 7.7 percent in October compared with a year earlier, much more than the roughly 2 percent annual gains that used to be the norm. Fed officials do see hopeful signs that inflation will cool next year. Supply chain problems are easing and market-based rent prices are no longer jumping, and both of those changes should provide some relief. But with the labor market so strong and wages climbing quickly, central bankers have also warned that it will be difficult for price increases to fall back to normal levels. The labor market “shows only tentative signs of rebalancing, and wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,” Mr. Powell said this week. That is what makes Friday’s report an awkward one for the central bank. It provided welcome news that the labor market is resilient, on one hand, but it also showed that companies are hiring at more than 2.5 times the pace the Fed thinks is necessary to accommodate population growth. Wage growth re-accelerated on a monthly basis, climbing a hefty 5.1 percent compared with the prior year. Investors read the report as a sign that the Fed will need to keep raising rates into 2023. That could make it harder to achieve a so-called “soft landing,” where inflation slows but the economy avoids recession — an outcome that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Powell say they would like to see. “To the extent that Chair Powell put some air into the soft landing narrative this week, this report undoes that to some degree,” said Neil Dutta, head of U.S. economics at Renaissance Macro Research. Mr. Dutta said that if the economy remains strong, that could prod Fed policymakers to work harder to slow consumer and business demand. That would increase the chances that the economy gets painfully squeezed down the road, sending unemployment higher. Mr. Biden seemed to brush off those fears on Friday, noting that in recent months, wage gains have outpaced inflation: “Wages for working families, in fact, over the last couple months have gone up. Up,” he said. “These wage increases are larger than the increase in inflation over the same period of time.” But Fed officials have struck a firmer tone, making it clear that pay gains will need to come down in order for them to be confident that inflation is under control. “Strong wage growth is a good thing,” Mr. Powell said this week. “But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.” The labor market could still slow next year, helping to weigh on inflation just as price increases on goods moderate and rent growth begins to cool — after all, the Fed has raised rates significantly already, and those moves are only now trickling through to temper economic growth. While job gains and wages were both well above economists’ expectations, some analysts pointed out that they have been slowing over the course of 2022. Republicans seized on the data point as “Biden’s worst jobs report of the year.” “The number was better than expected, but when you look at the broader picture in the U.S. labor market, demand for workers is slowing,” said Blerina Uruci, an economist at T. Rowe Price. Central bankers have signaled that they will slow their pace of rate increases this month, which should give them more time to gauge how much more they need to do to restrain the economy. But many economists and investors on Wall Street expect that won’t be enough to save the economy from a Fed-induced recession. Bank of America economists wrote this week that they foresee a downturn, flowing from “the headwinds of a weaker labor market, higher borrowing costs, tighter credit standards and weaker balance sheets.” If the job market continues to sprint rather than slowing to a jog, the recession scenario looms more likely — a possibility White House officials largely dismiss, but one that Fed officials have acknowledged. “I do continue to believe that there’s a path to a soft or softish landing,” Mr. Powell said this week. “To the extent we need to keep rates higher longer, that’s going to narrow the path to a soft landing.” This article appeared in print on page A14."

The S&P 500 slipped 0.2 percent, its fifth straight loss. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted with tech stocks, fell 0.5 percent, while the Dow Jones industrial average finished barely in the green.    Small company stocks also edged lower with the Russell 2000 index falling 0.3 percent. Every major index is on track for weekly losses.   Treasury yields fell significantly. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, slid to 3.41 percent from 3.53 percent late Tuesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which tends to track market expectations of future action by the Federal Reserve, fell to 4.27 percent from 4.36 percent.   Investors have been dealing with a relative lack of news ahead of updates on inflation and consumer sentiment later this week, and the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Inflation, the Fed's aggressive interest rate increases and recession worries remain the big concerns for Wall Street.   ''Investors continue to position for rates to go higher for longer,'' said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at the research firm CFRA.   Technology and communication services stocks were the biggest weights on the benchmark S&P 500 index. Apple fell 1.4 percent and Alphabet, Google's parent, dropped 2.1 percent.   Health care stocks were among the few bright spots. Pfizer rose 1.1 percent.   Investors rewarded several companies for solid earnings reports. Campbell Soup rose 6 percent after reporting strong results.   Carvana plunged 42.9 percent, its biggest single-day drop on record, after analysts at Wedbush Securities warned that the used vehicle chain's bankruptcy risk is rising. The company has lost 98 percent of its value since the beginning of the year.   U.S. crude oil prices fell 3 percent, settling at $72.01 per gallon, the lowest price this year. Analysts noted that conditions in the oil market have loosened compared with earlier this year, adding to oversupply worries at a time when more economists are warning of a recession.   Economic updates later this week could give investors more insight into inflation's path ahead and how the Fed will continue fighting high prices.   The U.S. will release data on weekly unemployment claims on Thursday. The jobs market has been a strong area of the otherwise slowing economy, making it more difficult for the Fed to tame inflation.   The government will release a report on wholesale prices Friday that will provide more details on how inflation is affecting businesses. The University of Michigan will release a December survey on consumer sentiment on Friday.   The reports do not typically move markets but are receiving elevated attention as they are some of the final data dumps before the Fed meets next week.   The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a half-percentage point at its meeting next week. It has raised its benchmark rate six times since March, driving it to a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent, the highest in 15 years. Wall Street expects the benchmark rate to reach a peak range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the middle of 2023.   Inflation has been easing and economists expect the upcoming data on wholesale and consumer prices to reflect that trend. The pace has been slow, though, and the Fed has been clear about its intent to keep raising interest rates until it is sure that inflation is cooling. That has raised concerns that the central bank could hit the brakes too hard on the economy and cause a recession.   A growing number of analysts expect the U.S. economy to slip into a recession in 2023, but are unsure of its potential severity and duration. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/07/business/08markets.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."

Pay gains continue to rise robustly.","Wage growth can be an important driver of inflation, so central bankers are watching it closely. Pay gains continue to rise robustly. Wage growth was stronger than economists expected in November, fresh data showed, as the Federal Reserve parses pay gains for signs of where inflation is headed and as workers struggle to keep pace with rising costs. Average hourly earnings climbed by 5.1 percent from the year before, Bureau of Labor Statistics data showed. That was more than the 4.6 percent economists in a Bloomberg survey had forecast. Wages had climbed 4.9 percent in the year through October. On a monthly basis, wages climbed 0.6 percent, the strongest pace since January. The picture that emerged from the data was one of job market in which employers are competing for workers and paying more to get them. Even as pay climbs swiftly, many workers are failing to keep pace with rapid inflation. Consumer Price Index inflation stood at7.7 percent in the year through October. Nevertheless, pay gains are rapid enough that officials at the Fed worry that they would make it difficult for inflation to return to a more typical 2 percent pace if they persist. That’s partly because companies that are paying higher wages — particularly in service industries, where labor is a major cost of doing business — are likely to charge customers more to protect their profits. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, highlighted wage gains as something the central bank is watching closely during a speech this week. “Wage growth remains well above levels that would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time,” Mr. Powell said repeatedly during his remarks, delivered at the Brookings Institution. “Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability.” While workers could be forced to curb spending after many months in which their paychecks have fallen behind price gains, which could help demand to cool and force companies to lower prices to compete for shoppers, that moderation has been patchy. Consumption re-accelerated in October, data this week showed. Many families have substantial savings amassed during the pandemic, which they are steadily spending. Households paid down debt during the pandemic, so they have capacity to use credit to sustain consumption. And the U.S. economy has been adding jobs rapidly, which — paired with solid wage gains — has helped to keep overall income rising faster than prices. “To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing,” Mr. Powell said this week. “But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2 percent inflation.”"

The Fed is continuing to raise interest rates. And inflation is affecting the mind-set of holiday shoppers.","What’s Up? (Dec. 11-17) Criminal Charges for Sam Bankman-Fried Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was expected to appear before the House Committee on Financial Services last Tuesday — one of the many efforts to investigate the exchange’s collapse. But the day before, he was arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges. He faces eight counts, which include several fraud charges and conspiring to defraud the United States and violate campaign finance laws. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges, accusing Mr. Bankman-Fried of misleading investors who committed some $2 billion to FTX, among other charges.  It was not long ago that the voluble crypto mogul was discussing his role in the downfall of FTX with reporters at The New York Times and elsewhere.  Musk and Twitter It began with private planes. Last week, Elon Musk suspended 25 accounts on Twitter that were dedicated to keeping tabs on the planes of government agencies, billionaires and other prominent figures, including Mr. Musk. (His flights were tracked by the account @ElonJet using public data.) Shortly after completing his purchase of Twitter in October, Mr. Musk said he would allow the account to remain on the platform, holding up this move as the apotheosis of free speech. But on Wednesday, Mr. Musk suspended not only @ElonJet but two dozen similar accounts. Soon after, he suspended the accounts of half a dozen journalists who wrote about the suspension of the private-plane trackers or who had written critically about Mr. Musk’s ownership of Twitter. But early Saturday, he said he was reinstating the accounts of several journalists. Inflation Eases, but the Fed Holds Steady Inflation data for November brought good news for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, but it wasn’t enough to alter the central bank’s plans to press on with its campaign to raise interest rates. The Consumer Price Index fell to 7.1 percent last month, down from 7.7 in October and far from its most recent peak of 9.1 percent in June. Nonetheless, the day after the release of that data, the Fed made clear that it intended to continue its campaign to cool an overheated economy. Officials did slow the pace of interest rate increases — raising rates by half a percent point instead of three-quarters, the size of the last four consecutive increases — but they signaled that rates would continue to rise in the new year. The Fed is still intent on hitting its target of 2 percent inflation, and Jerome H. Powell, the central bank’s chair, said the plan included “probably high rates, probably held for longer.” What’s Next? (Dec. 18-24) Holiday Cheer, Deeply Discounted Inflation may be beginning to moderate, but the inflationary mind-set persists. For holiday shoppers, that could mean continuing to be more conscious about spending, as recent data about retail sales in November seemed to foretell. U.S. retail sales fell 0.6 percent from October, even with the Thanksgiving rush, when nearly 200 million Americans shopped over a five-day period that included Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Some analysts suggested that customers might be spending more now on travel, entertainment and other in-person experiences and less on traditionally popular gift categories like clothing and sporting goods. Some presents under the tree could be replaced with gift cards or tickets to events, for example. And many consumers will probably continue to seek deep discounts when shopping for loved ones, as they account for tighter budgets than in recent years. Replenishing the Country’s Oil Reserves To account for the tightening oil supply that resulted from Western sanctions on Russia, the Biden administration relied heavily this year on tapping the country’s emergency reserves to keep oil flowing and ease prices at the gas pump, particularly ahead of the midterm elections. As a result, the reserve was reduced to its lowest level in four decades after the Energy Department released more than a quarter of its stockpile, or nearly 200 million barrels of crude, since March. Now the White House is preparing to replenish it in the new year: On Friday, the Energy Department announced that it would begin repurchasing crude, starting with three million barrels in February. The department framed the plan as a good deal for American taxpayers, because the administration would be repurchasing the crude at a lower price than it was sold for. The move comes as gas prices continue to moderate; the national average on Friday was about $3.18, according to AAA, below where it was a year earlier. . Efforts to Halt a Union Results are expected this week from the National Labor Relations Board on an effort by Amazon to overturn the results of an April union election at the Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8. The unionization effort had been something of a long-shot bid by an independent union. But it clinched a victory by more than 10 percentage points, the first union victory at an Amazon in the United States. In its filing to the N.L.R.B., the company argued that the labor board had conducted the vote unfairly and that the union had used improper methods to secure workers’ support. But a federal labor official who presided over Amazon’s challenge said these claims had little basis. This year, The New York Times reported that Amazon relied on mandatory anti-union sessions to argue that the union had not “delivered for its members” and to provide sometimes misleading information about changes to wages if a union were voted in. What Else? The U.S. State Department announced a new round of sanctions on prominent Russians last week. A new report found that a 13-year-old just joining TikTok would encounter recommended posts related to self-harm and eating disorders within 30 minutes.

The muted action came as traders looked ahead to a closely watched monthly report on the job market due out Friday that will show how the labor market is holding up and how that may influence what the Fed does next in its bid to cool inflation.    The S&P 500 closed 0.1 percent lower after drifting modestly higher and lower for much of the day. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq composite edged up 0.1 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small companies also took a step back, falling by 0.3 percent.   Banks and household goods providers were among the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500. Bank of America fell 2.9 percent and Costco slid 6.6 percent.   Gains in health care companies, communications services stocks and elsewhere in the market helped keep the losses in check. The drugmaker Pfizer rose 1.9 percent and Netflix climbed 3.7 percent.   Salesforce slumped 8.3 percent for the biggest drop in the S&P 500 after Bret Taylor said he would resign as co-chief executive of the customer-management software developer.   Yields on both short-term and long-term bonds fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, edged lower. The yield on the two-year note, which tends to track market expectations of future Fed action, fell to 4.24 percent from 4.33 percent a day earlier.   Major indexes are coming off their second straight month of gains. Markets rallied Wednesday after Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell indicated that the central bank could dial back the pace of its interest rate increases as soon as this month. The Fed has been aggressively raising interest rates to tame stubbornly hot inflation.   A measure of inflation that is closely monitored by the Fed eased in October. Wall Street has been closely watching any updates about inflation to get a better sense of whether the Fed will tone down its interest rate increases.   Mr. Powell said the central bank could begin moderating its pace of rate hikes at its next meeting in mid-December. The Fed, though, has been very clear about its intent to continue raising interest rates until it is sure that inflation is cooling.   The Fed has raised its benchmark rate six times since March, driving it to a range of 3.75 percent to 4 percent, the highest in 15 years. Wall Street expects the benchmark rate to reach a peak range of 5 percent to 5.25 percent by the middle of 2023.   A big concern for Wall Street has been whether the Fed can tame rates without sending the economy into a recession as it hits the brakes on growth. Businesses are seeing demand fall for a wide range of goods as inflation squeezes wallets. Analysts generally expect the U.S. to dip into a recession, even if it is mild and short, at some point in 2023.   ''What turns mild recessions into deep economic scarring is the buildup of excess, and we don't have a bubble this time,'' said Katie Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust Wealth Management.   Inflation will continue to be the main focus for Wall Street, and ''on that score, things seem to be coming off the boil,'' she said.   Investors are also getting more data this week on inflation's impact on the broader economy. Activity in the manufacturing sector contracted in November for the first time since May 2020, according to the Institute for Supply Management. The report also showed that prices are falling.   ''All signs point to a deceleration of inflation in everything except wages,'' Ms. Nixon said.

"66","This Economy Is Simply Wacky","December 20, 2022 Tuesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",1603,"Jeanna Smialek",NA,"Historical data has always been critical to those who make economic predictions. But three years into the pandemic, America is suffering through an economic whiplash of sorts -- and the past is proving anything but a reliable guide. Forecasts have been upended repeatedly. The economy's rebound from the hit it incurred at the onset of the coronavirus was faster and stronger than expected. Shortages of goods then collided with strong demand to fuel a burst in inflation, one that has been both more extreme and more stubborn than anticipated.    Now, after a year in which the Federal Reserve raised interest rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s to slow growth and bring those rapid price increases back under control, central bankers, Wall Street economists and Biden administration officials are all trying to guess what might lie ahead for the economy in 2023. Will the Fed's policies spur a recession? Or will the economy gently cool down, taming high inflation in the process?   With typical patterns still out of whack across big parts of the economy -- including housing, cars and the labor market -- the answer is far from certain, and past experience is almost sure to serve as a poor map.   ''I don't think anyone knows whether we're going to have a recession or not, and if we do, whether it's going to be a deep one or not,'' Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a news conference last week. ''It's not knowable.''   Doubt about what comes next is one reason the Fed is reorienting its monetary policy approach. Officials are now nudging borrowing costs up more gradually, giving them time to see how their policies are affecting the economy and how much more is needed to ensure that inflation returns to a slow and steady pace.   As policymakers try to guess what lies ahead, the markets that have been most disrupted in recent years illustrate how big changes -- some spurred by the pandemic, others tied to demographic shifts -- continue to ricochet through the economy and make forecasting an exercise in uncertainty.   Housing is strange.   The pandemic era has repeatedly upended the housing market. The virus's onset sent urbanites rushing for more space in suburban and small-city homes, a trend that was reinforced by rock-bottom mortgage rates.   Then, reopenings from lockdown pulled people back toward cities. That helped push up rents in major metropolitan areas -- which make up a big chunk of inflation -- and, paired with the Fed's rate increases, it has helped to sharply slow home buying in many markets.   The question is what happens next. When it comes to the rental market, new lease data from Zillow and Apartment List suggests that conditions are cooling. The supply of available apartments and homes is also expected to climb in 2023 as long-awaited new residential buildings are finished.   ''The frame I would put on 2023 is that we're really going to enter the year back in a demand-constrained environment,'' said Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List. ''We're going to see more apartments competing for fewer renters.''   Mr. Popov expects ''small growth'' in rents in 2023, but he said that outlook is uncertain and hinges on the state of the labor market. If unemployment soars, rents could fall. If workers do really well, rents could rise more quickly.   At the same time, existing leases are still catching up to the big run-up that has happened over the past year as tenants renew at higher rates. It is hard to guess both how much official inflation will converge with market-based rent data, and how long the trend will take to fully play out.   ''It could resolve in months, or it could take a year,'' said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group.   Then there's the market for owned housing, which does not count into inflation but does matter for the pace of overall economic growth. New home sales have fallen off a cliff as surging mortgage costs and the recent price run-up has put purchasing a house out of reach for many families. Even so, new mortgage applications have ticked up at the slightest sign of relief in recent months, evidence that would-be buyers are waiting on the sidelines.   Demographics explain that underlying demand. Many millennials, the roughly 26- to 41-year-olds who are America's largest generation, were entering peak home-buying ages right around the onset of the pandemic, and many are still in the market -- which could put a floor under how much home prices will moderate.   Plus, ''sellers don't have to sell,'' said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, who expects home prices to be ''flattish'' next year as demand wanes but supply, which was already sharply limited after a decade of under-building following the 2007 housing crash, further pulls back.   Given all the moving parts, many analysts are either much more optimistic or very pessimistic.   ''It's almost comical to see the house price growth forecasts,'' Mr. Popov said. ''It's either 3 percent growth or double-digit declines, with almost nothing in between.''   The car market remains weird, too.   The car market, a major driver of America's initial inflation burst, is another economic puzzle. Years of too little supply have unleashed pent-up demand that is spurring unusual consumer and company behavior.   Used cars were in especially short supply early in the pandemic, but are finally more widely available. The wholesale prices that dealers pay to stock their lots have plummeted in recent months.   But car sellers are taking longer to pass those steep declines along to consumers than many economists had expected. Wholesale prices are down about 14.2 percent from a year ago, while consumer prices for used cars and trucks have declined only 3.3 percent. Many experts think that means bigger markdowns are coming, but there's uncertainty about how soon and how steep.   The new car market is even stranger. It remains undersupplied amid a parts shortages, though that is beginning to change as supply chain issues ease and production recovers. But both dealers and auto companies have made big profits during the low-supply, high-price era, and some have floated the idea of maintaining leaner production and inventories to keep their returns high.   Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, thinks the normal laws of supply and demand will eventually reassert themselves as companies fight to retain customers. But getting back to normal will be a gradual, and perhaps halting, process.   Still, ''we're at an inflection point,'' Mr. Smoke said. ''I think new vehicles are going to be less and less inflationary.''   Labor markets are the most important question mark.   Perhaps the most critical economic mystery is what will happen next in America's labor market -- and that is hard to game out.   Part of the problem is that it's not entirely clear what is happening in the labor market right now. Most signs suggest that hiring has been strong, job openings are plentiful, and wages are climbing at the fastest pace in decades. But there is a huge divergence between different data series: The Labor Department's survey of households shows much weaker hiring growth than its survey of employers. Adding to the confusion, recent research has suggested that revisions could make today's labor growth look much more lackluster.   ''It's a huge mystery,'' said Mr. Ozimek from the Economic Innovation Group. ''You have to figure out which data are wrong.''   That confusion makes guessing what comes next even more difficult. If, like most economists, one accepts that the labor market is hot right now, Fed policy is clearly poised to cool it down: The central bank has raised interest rates from near zero to about 4.4 percent this year, and expects to lift them to 5.1 percent in 2023.   Those moves are explicitly aimed at slowing down hiring and wage growth, because central bankers believe that inflation for many types of services will remain elevated if pay gains remain as strong as they are now. Dentist offices and restaurants will, in theory, try to pass climbing labor costs along to consumers to protect their profits.    But it is unclear how much the job market needs to slow to bring pay gains back to the more normal levels the Fed is looking for, and whether it can decelerate sufficiently without plunging America into a painful recession.   Companies seem to be facing major labor shortages, partly as a wave of baby boomers retires, and Fed officials hope that will make firms more inclined to hang onto their workers even if the broader economy slows drastically. Some policymakers have suggested that such ''labor hoarding'' could help them achieve a soft landing that bucks historical precedent: Unemployment could rise notably without spiraling higher, cooling the economy without tipping it into a painful downturn.   Typically, when the unemployment rate rises by more than 0.5 percentage points, like the Fed forecasts it will do next year, the jobless rate keeps rising. Loss of economic momentum feeds on itself, and the nation plunges into a recession. That pattern is so established it has a name: the Sahm Rule, for the economist Claudia Sahm.   Yet Ms. Sahm herself said that if the axiom were to break down, this wacky economic moment would be the time. Consumers are sitting on unusual savings piles that could help sustain middle-class spending even through some job losses, preventing a downward spiral.   ''The thing that has never happened would have to happen,'' she said. ''But hey, things that have never happened have been happening left and right.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/business/economy/recession-economy-forecast-2023.html  Graphic"

Federal Reserve officials are keenly focused on the health of hiring and wages as they try to figure out what might come next for inflation and monetary policy. On Friday, they received further evidence that a meaningful job market slowdown remains elusive. Central bankers care about the labor market because it could be a key factor in determining how much and how quickly inflation will fade. While other sources of inflation — including supply chain issues and rapidly rising rents — appear poised to dissipate in 2023, an imbalance between job openings and available workers persists. That could keep wages rising as companies compete for a limited supply of workers, which could in turn push prices up in labor-intensive service industries as companies try to cover their climbing payroll bills. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, highlighted service industry inflation and its links to the labor market in a closely watched speech earlier this week. “This may be the most important category for understanding the future evolution of core inflation,” Mr. Powell said of the set of services that covers things including health care, haircuts and hospitality. “Because wages make up the largest cost in delivering these services, the labor market holds the key to understanding inflation in this category.” Friday’s jobs report suggested that hiring in service industries remained solid, and that wages continued to climb at a rapid pace: jumping by 5.1 percent over the past year, far more than economists expected. Wages in service industries picked up by 5.3 percent on an annual basis, much more than the 2.5 percent that was common in the decade leading up to the pandemic. Job gains also remained solid, with employment climbing by 263,000 in November, much faster than the level that the Fed thinks is necessary to keep the economy steady. “Job growth remains far in excess of the pace needed to accommodate population growth over time — about 100,000 per month by many estimates,” Mr. Powell said this week, noting that the labor market “shows only tentative signs of rebalancing.”"

In This Economy?","December 19, 2022 Monday 14:09 EST","BUSINESS; economy",1680,"Jeanna Smialek","Years into the pandemic, it is still difficult to get a handle on what comes next for the economy by looking at examples from the past.","Historical data has always been critical to those who make economic predictions. But three years into the pandemic, America is suffering through an economic whiplash of sorts — and the past is proving anything but a reliable guide. Forecasts have been upended repeatedly. The economy’s rebound from the hit it incurred at the onset of the coronavirus was faster and stronger than expected. Shortages of goods then collided with strong demand to fuel a burst in inflation, one that has been both more extreme and more stubborn than anticipated. Now, after a year in which the Federal Reserve raised interest rates at the fastest pace since the 1980s to slow growth and bring those rapid price increases back under control, central bankers, Wall Street economists and Biden administration officials are all trying to guess what might lie ahead for the economy in 2023. Will the Fed’s policies spur a recession? Or will the economy gently cool down, taming high inflation in the process? With typical patterns still out of whack across big parts of the economy — including housing, cars and the labor market — the answer is far from certain, and past experience is almost sure to serve as a poor map. “I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not, and if we do, whether it’s going to be a deep one or not,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a news conference last week. “It’s not knowable.” Doubt about what comes next is one reason the Fed is reorienting its monetary policy approach. Officials are now nudging borrowing costs up more gradually, giving them time to see how their policies are affecting the economy and how much more is needed to ensure that inflation returns to a slow and steady pace. As policymakers try to guess what lies ahead, the markets that have been most disrupted in recent years illustrate how big changes — some spurred by the pandemic, others tied to demographic shifts — continue to ricochet through the economy and make forecasting an exercise in uncertainty. Housing is strange. The pandemic era has repeatedly upended the housing market. The virus’s onset sent urbanites rushing for more space in suburban and small-city homes, a trend that was reinforced by rock-bottom mortgage rates. Then, reopenings from lockdown pulled people back toward cities. That helped push up rents in major metropolitan areas — which make up a big chunk of inflation — and, paired with the Fed’s rate increases, it has helped to sharply slow home buying in many markets. The question is what happens next. When it comes to the rental market, new lease data from Zillow and Apartment List suggests that conditions are cooling. The supply of available apartments and homes is also expected to climb in 2023 as long-awaited new residential buildings are finished. “The frame I would put on 2023 is that we’re really going to enter the year back in a demand-constrained environment,” said Igor Popov, chief economist at Apartment List. “We’re going to see more apartments competing for fewer renters.” Mr. Popov expects “small growth” in rents in 2023, but he said that outlook is uncertain and hinges on the state of the labor market. If unemployment soars, rents could fall. If workers do really well, rents could rise more quickly. At the same time, existing leases are still catching up to the big run-up that has happened over the past year as tenants renew at higher rates. It is hard to guess both how much official inflation will converge with market-based rent data, and how long the trend will take to fully play out. “It could resolve in months, or it could take a year,” said Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at the Economic Innovation Group. Then there’s the market for owned housing, which does not count into inflation but does matter for the pace of overall economic growth. New home sales have fallen off a cliff as surging mortgage costs and the recent price run-up has put purchasing a house out of reach for many families. Even so, new mortgage applications have ticked up at the slightest sign of relief in recent months, evidence that would-be buyers are waiting on the sidelines. Demographics explain that underlying demand. Many millennials, the roughly 26- to 41-year-olds who are America’s largest generation, were entering peak home-buying ages right around the onset of the pandemic, and many are still in the market — which could put a floor under how much home prices will moderate. Plus, “sellers don’t have to sell,” said Mike Fratantoni, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, who expects home prices to be “flattish” next year as demand wanes but supply, which was already sharply limited after a decade of under-building following the 2007 housing crash, further pulls back. Given all the moving parts, many analysts are either much more optimistic or very pessimistic. “It’s almost comical to see the house price growth forecasts,” Mr. Popov said. “It’s either 3 percent growth or double-digit declines, with almost nothing in between.” The car market remains weird, too. The car market, a major driver of America’s initial inflation burst, is another economic puzzle. Years of too little supply have unleashed pent-up demand that is spurring unusual consumer and company behavior. Used cars were in especially short supply early in the pandemic, but are finally more widely available. The wholesale prices that dealers pay to stock their lots have plummeted in recent months. But car sellers are taking longer to pass those steep declines along to consumers than many economists had expected. Wholesale prices are down about 14.2 percent from a year ago, while consumer prices for used cars and trucks have declined only 3.3 percent. Many experts think that means bigger markdowns are coming, but there’s uncertainty about how soon and how steep. The new car market is even stranger. It remains undersupplied amid a parts shortages, though that is beginning to change as supply chain issues ease and production recovers. But both dealers and auto companies have made big profits during the low-supply, high-price era, and some have floated the idea of maintaining leaner production and inventories to keep their returns high. Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, thinks the normal laws of supply and demand will eventually reassert themselves as companies fight to retain customers. But getting back to normal will be a gradual, and perhaps halting, process. Still, “we’re at an inflection point,” Mr. Smoke said. “I think new vehicles are going to be less and less inflationary.” Labor markets are the most important question mark. Perhaps the most critical economic mystery is what will happen next in America’s labor market — and that is hard to game out. Part of the problem is that it’s not entirely clear what is happening in the labor market right now. Most signs suggest that hiring has been strong, job openings are plentiful, and wages are climbing at the fastest pace in decades. But there is a huge divergence between different data series: The Labor Department’s survey of households shows much weaker hiring growth than its survey of employers. Adding to the confusion, recent research has suggested that revisions could make today’s labor growth look much more lackluster. “It’s a huge mystery,” said Mr. Ozimek from the Economic Innovation Group. “You have to figure out which data are wrong.” That confusion makes guessing what comes next even more difficult. If, like most economists, one accepts that the labor market is hot right now, Fed policy is clearly poised to cool it down: The central bank has raised interest rates from near zero to about 4.4 percent this year, and expects to lift them to 5.1 percent in 2023. Those moves are explicitly aimed at slowing down hiring and wage growth, because central bankers believe that inflation for many types of services will remain elevated if pay gains remain as strong as they are now. Dentist offices and restaurants will, in theory, try to pass climbing labor costs along to consumers to protect their profits.  But it is unclear how much the job market needs to slow to bring pay gains back to the more normal levels the Fed is looking for, and whether it can decelerate sufficiently without plunging America into a painful recession. Companies seem to be facing major labor shortages, partly as a wave of baby boomers retires, and Fed officials hope that will make firms more inclined to hang onto their workers even if the broader economy slows drastically. Some policymakers have suggested that such “labor hoarding” could help them achieve a soft landing that bucks historical precedent: Unemployment could rise notably without spiraling higher, cooling the economy without tipping it into a painful downturn. Typically, when the unemployment rate rises by more than 0.5 percentage points, like the Fed forecasts it will do next year, the jobless rate keeps rising. Loss of economic momentum feeds on itself, and the nation plunges into a recession. That pattern is so established it has a name: the Sahm Rule, for the economist Claudia Sahm. Yet Ms. Sahm herself said that if the axiom were to break down, this wacky economic moment would be the time. Consumers are sitting on unusual savings piles that could help sustain middle-class spending even through some job losses, preventing a downward spiral. “The thing that has never happened would have to happen,” she said. “But hey, things that have never happened have been happening left and right.”"

Will markets fall further next year? Market watchers look for optimism amid the gloom    Tech stocks, Treasury bills, cryptocurrencies, real estate. The great market sell-off of 2022 has been indiscriminate, wiping trillions off the stock market capitalization of risky and not-so-risky assets, and taking a huge bite out of average investors' retirement plans.   Despite the carnage, many investors are sticking with their beaten-down stock portfolios as they head into the new year. ''There doesn't seem to be a lot of people, despite the drawdowns, who are saying, 'Hey, the pain has been awful,''' Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, told DealBook. ''And the reason is, because all things considered, they're still up 50 percent since the start of the pandemic.''   Ms. Shalett doesn't see much evidence that the broader stock market is due for a rebound any time soon, but she's not writing off 2023 either.   Morgan Stanley has a 2023 price target of 3,900 for the S&P 500 and expects the benchmark index to flatline over the next 12 months. (The S&P closed at 3,844 on Dec. 23, down roughly 20 percent this year.)   Still, Wall Street as a whole hasn't been so divided about the prospects for the next year since the global financial crisis, reflecting deep uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, corporate profits and a wider debate about whether the world's biggest economy will fall into recession. The average forecast expects the S&P 500 to end 2023 at 4,009, according to Bloomberg, the most bearish outlook since 1999. But the predictions range from a low of 3,400 to as high as 4,500, representing ''the widest dispersion since 2009,'' Ms. Shalett pointed out.   ''There's always uncertainty in forecasts. But you know, many times you have a good gauge of where you are with [Fed] policy, where you are in the profit cycle, where you are in terms of valuation,'' she said. ''As we head into 2023, it's been our opinion that all of those things are in flux.''   The bull case   At the upper end of forecasts is Bankim Chadha, chief U.S. equity and global strategist at Deutsche Bank, who sees the S&P 500 closing out 2023 17 percent higher than last Friday's market close.   It will be a choppy ride to hit that 4,500 price target, however. Mr. Chadha predicts the market will rally through the first quarter (led by a rebound in tech and financial stocks), followed by a big midyear drop, only for stocks to bounce back and return to their 2023 highs by the end of December.   It's not a completely boldfaced call. Deutsche Bank sees a mild recession arriving by the third quarter of next year. The downturn will affect most consumers, home-sellers and, ultimately, corporate profits -- but it will only last a few quarters before some semblance of growth returns.   All eyes on the Fed   What could lift markets next year is a shift by the Fed. If the U.S. central bank starts to tap the brakes on rate increases in 2023, stocks could rally. (Many bulls on Wall Street believe the Fed will cut rates in the latter half of the year as inflation eases, despite zero indication from Fed chair Jay Powell that it  will do any such thing.)   Rob Dent and Aichi Amemiya, economists at Nomura, see another factor influencing Fed policy in 2023: politics. The Biden Administration has been largely quiet throughout 2022 as the central bank raised the prime lending rate to a target range of 4.25 to 4.5 percent from essentially zero a year ago. That silence could come to an abrupt end, particularly if aggressive monetary policy forces employers to cut jobs.   ''The criticism from Congress will likely intensify next year as job losses start,'' the economists wrote in a recent investor note. ''Powell's hawkish commentary so far has been easier to maintain in an environment with historically low unemployment rates, but that will likely become more difficult once the labor market deteriorates. His semiannual testimony before Congress in February will likely be contentious.''   Conflicting signals for the year ahead   For those who believe in holiday miracles, the last trading week of the year has historically been a winner for stocks. ''The Santa rally,'' as Wall Street veterans call it, covers the seven trading days that follow Christmas when the S&P 500 typically outperforms its historical rolling seven-day average. The most bullish see the Santa rally as an indicator of future returns well into the new year.   The glass-half-full scenario: There are a few whales still buying stocks. Corporations executed a record $1 trillion worth of share buybacks this year, according to Goldman Sachs.   The glass-half-empty view: Corporations won't keep up that pace next year, Goldman added.    Ms. Shalett of Morgan Stanley also predicts a dud of a year for stocks. But unlike many of her peers, she sees the U.S. avoiding recession, as resilient consumers continue spending and companies reinvest to keep the economy growing just enough to avoid a slowdown. ''The implication of that is inflation is higher for longer, and the Fed is higher for longer,'' she added, which explains why stocks will be under pressure as corporate profits slump by 10 to 15 percent.   But there are cases for optimism. Ms. Shalett is advising clients to consider Treasury bills and value stocks that carry high dividends. She also expects emerging market economies, such as India and Brazil, to outperform, helped by a weaker dollar and a gradual easing of energy and food prices in 2023.   Grading Wall Street's ability to see into the future   How did Wall Street's predictions turn out in 2022? Mixed. At the start of the year, analysts on average saw the S&P 500 climbing to 4,950. They missed badly.   The problem: Almost nobody saw inflation rising to a 40-year-high, and that the Fed, in turn, would respond with a succession of jumbo interest rate increases to raise borrowing costs to their highest level since 2007.   Wall Street did a better job predicting corporate earnings. Analysts saw earnings per share for the S&P 500 as a whole coming in at $221 at year-end, and it looks like they'll be within 1 to 2 percent of that call.   But even that doesn't tell the full story. Corporations were forced to raise prices this year, and that may be why so many of them achieved their profit target, or came so close to doing so, Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, pointed out in a recent investor note. On a real return basis, which takes inflation into account, corporate profits looked less impressive.   ''We just don't see a real catalyst for growth to bounce back,'' he added.

Stocks tumbled on Thursday as investors feared that central banks were prepared to continue raising interest rates to bring down inflation despite signs that economies were already slowing.    The S&P 500 closed with losses of 2.5 percent, adding to a downturn that came after the Federal Reserve announced a half-point rate increase on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 3.2 percent and is down about 31 percent since the beginning of the year. The Bank of England and European Central Bank on Thursday also raised their policy rates by half a point.   ''Risk aversion is returning as investors focus on global central bank tightening, rising recession risks and softer economic data, which suggests that the U.S. economy is seeing larger parts weaken now,'' said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at the foreign exchange brokerage OANDA.   Investors have been looking for signs that central banks will slow the pace of tightening. Even though the Fed and others this week announced smaller rate increases than in previous meetings, none were willing to declare victory over inflation. The Bank of England, which has raised rates in nine consecutive meetings, estimated that the British economy was already in recession, but pledged to ''respond forcefully'' if inflation proved persistent. The European Central Bank said that rates would ''still have to rise significantly and at a steady pace'' to tame price pressures.   The drop in stocks pulled the index into a loss for the week. The S&P 500 is down more than 18 percent since the beginning of the year. In addition, 10 of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index are down so far this year. Energy, the best-performing sector, is up more than 53 percent since January. On the other hand, the communication services sector, which includes companies like Walt Disney, Netflix and AT&T, is down about 40 percent since the beginning of the year.   ''The markets continue to take two steps forward and three steps back and one step forward and two steps back,'' said Ed Cofrancesco, the chief executive of the International Assets Advisory.   ''We believe that the market is going to continue to mambo and make lower lows and lower highs,'' Mr. Cofrancesco said. ''As part of that mambo, the market is going to overreact to good news and it's going to overreact to bad news.''   Policymakers at the Fed and other major central banks have expressed their determination to bring stubbornly high inflation under control by raising rates to cool their economies, even if that means higher unemployment and lower growth. When asked about the possible economic pain caused by the Fed's policies, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that a failure to rein in rising prices would be more painful.   ''We have more work to do,'' Mr. Powell said on Wednesday, with forecasts by Fed officials suggesting that they expected rates to peak higher and remain elevated for longer than they previously predicted. That could squeeze the economy harder; worse-than-expected retail sales data released on Thursday showed that consumers were wary of spending in November, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season despite promotions like Black Friday.   Britain's FTSE 100 fell nearly 1 percent and the Pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped 2.9 percent.   The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell slightly. Oil prices traded lower while the dollar rose 0.8 percent against a basket of other major currencies.   ''Traders are still, though, taking a look at the big picture and we're going to see a global economic slowdown in the first half of next year and I think the recession risks are elevated,'' Mr. Moya of OANDA said. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/business/stocks-dow-fed-inflation.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."
"71","The Week in Business: The FTX Founder's Rapid Fall","December 18, 2022 Sunday","Section BU; Column 0; Money and Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2; WITH INTEREST",1005,"Marie Solis",NA,"What's Up? (Dec. 11-17)    Criminal Charges for Sam Bankman-Fried   Sam Bankman-Fried, the founder of the failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, was expected to appear before the House Committee on Financial Services last Tuesday -- one of the many efforts to investigate the exchange's collapse. But the day before, he was arrested in the Bahamas after U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges. He faces eight counts, which include several fraud charges and conspiring to defraud the United States and violate campaign finance laws. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges, accusing Mr. Bankman-Fried of misleading investors who committed some $2 billion to FTX, among other charges.  It was not long ago that the voluble crypto mogul was discussing his role in the downfall of FTX with reporters at The New York Times and elsewhere.    Musk and Twitter   It began with private planes. Last week, Elon Musk suspended 25 accounts on Twitter that were dedicated to keeping tabs on the planes of government agencies, billionaires and other prominent figures, including Mr. Musk. (His flights were tracked by the account @ElonJet using public data.) Shortly after completing his purchase of Twitter in October, Mr. Musk said he would allow the account to remain on the platform, holding up this move as the apotheosis of free speech. But on Wednesday, Mr. Musk suspended not only @ElonJet but two dozen similar accounts. Soon after, he suspended the accounts of half a dozen journalists who wrote about the suspension of the private-plane trackers or who had written critically about Mr. Musk's ownership of Twitter. But early Saturday, he said he was reinstating the accounts of several journalists.   Inflation Eases, but the Fed Holds Steady   Inflation data for November brought good news for policymakers at the Federal Reserve, but it wasn't enough to alter the central bank's plans to press on with its campaign to raise interest rates. The Consumer Price Index fell to 7.1 percent last month, down from 7.7 in October and far from its most recent peak of 9.1 percent in June. Nonetheless, the day after the release of that data, the Fed made clear that it intended to continue its campaign to cool an overheated economy. Officials did slow the pace of interest rate increases -- raising rates by half a percent point instead of three-quarters, the size of the last four consecutive increases -- but they signaled that rates would continue to rise in the new year. The Fed is still intent on hitting its target of 2 percent inflation, and Jerome H. Powell, the central bank's chair, said the plan included ''probably high rates, probably held for longer.''   What's Next? (Dec. 18-24)   Holiday Cheer, Deeply Discounted   Inflation may be beginning to moderate, but the inflationary mind-set persists. For holiday shoppers, that could mean continuing to be more conscious about spending, as recent data about retail sales in November seemed to foretell. U.S. retail sales fell 0.6 percent from October, even with the Thanksgiving rush, when nearly 200 million Americans shopped over a five-day period that included Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Some analysts suggested that customers might be spending more now on travel, entertainment and other in-person experiences and less on traditionally popular gift categories like clothing and sporting goods. Some presents under the tree could be replaced with gift cards or tickets to events, for example. And many consumers will probably continue to seek deep discounts when shopping for loved ones, as they account for tighter budgets than in recent years.   Replenishing the Country's Oil Reserves   To account for the tightening oil supply that resulted from Western sanctions on Russia, the Biden administration relied heavily this year on tapping the country's emergency reserves to keep oil flowing and ease prices at the gas pump, particularly ahead of the midterm elections. As a result, the reserve was reduced to its lowest level in four decades after the Energy Department released more than a quarter of its stockpile, or nearly 200 million barrels of crude, since March. Now the White House is preparing to replenish it in the new year: On Friday, the Energy Department announced that it would begin repurchasing crude, starting with three million barrels in February. The department framed the plan as a good deal for American taxpayers, because the administration would be repurchasing the crude at a lower price than it was sold for. The move comes as gas prices continue to moderate; the national average on Friday was about $3.18, according to AAA, below where it was a year earlier. .   Efforts to Halt a Union   Results are expected this week from the National Labor Relations Board on an effort by Amazon to overturn the results of an April union election at the Staten Island warehouse known as JFK8. The unionization effort had been something of a long-shot bid by an independent union. But it clinched a victory by more than 10 percentage points, the first union victory at an Amazon in the United States. In its filing to the N.L.R.B., the company argued that the labor board had conducted the vote unfairly and that the union had used improper methods to secure workers' support. But a federal labor official who presided over Amazon's challenge said these claims had little basis. This year, The New York Times reported that Amazon relied on mandatory anti-union sessions to argue that the union had not ''delivered for its members'' and to provide sometimes misleading information about changes to wages if a union were voted in.   What Else?   The U.S. State Department announced a new round of sanctions on prominent Russians last week. A new report found that a 13-year-old just joining TikTok would encounter recommended posts related to self-harm and eating disorders within 30 minutes. And the latest data from the Personal Consumption Expenditure index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, will be released on Friday. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/17/business/the-week-in-business-the-ftx-arrest.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page BU2."

On a real return basis, which takes inflation into account, corporate profits looked less impressive. “We just don’t see a real catalyst for growth to bounce back,” he added. We’d like your feedback!

"73","Skyrocketing Prices in Turkey Hurt Families and Tarnish Erdogan","December 5, 2022 Monday 09:20 EST","WORLD; europe",1528,"Ben Hubbard","Annual inflation is around its highest level in decades, devaluing salaries and devouring savings less than a year before President Recep Tayyip Erdogan runs for re-election.","Annual inflation is around its highest level in decades, devaluing salaries and devouring savings less than a year before President Recep Tayyip Erdogan runs for re-election. ISTANBUL — As Turkey’s annual inflation rate has soared above 80 percent, families are being forced to stick with worn-out clothes and shoes and to cut meat from their diets while some struggle to afford school lunches for their children. Exacerbating the country’s worst inflation crisis in more than two decades, economists say, are the unorthodox financial policies of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has insisted on lowering interest rates in defiance of a broad economic consensus that inflation is best controlled by raising them. The belt-tightening is so severe that it has soured many voters on Mr. Erdogan, Turkey’s paramount politician for nearly two decades, leaving him politically vulnerable as he prepares to run for re-election next year. “Living conditions are difficult, paying rent is difficult, paying at the market is difficult — everything is difficult,” said Ese Gucer, a resident of the southern city of Adana who has long voted for Mr. Erdogan and his party. “My faith in Erdogan has been shaken because of the economy,” added Ms. Gucer, 32. “He lost me.” Year on year, inflation was 84.4 percent in November, according to data released on Monday by the Turkish Statistical Institute. That was a slight decline from 85.5 percent in October, the highest rate in 24 years. Some economic monitors say the real rate for many of Turkey’s roughly 85 million people is much higher. The lower rate was unlikely to provide immediate relief for most people, but the government said it represented a turning point. “We have entered a downward trend in inflation, leaving the peak behind, unless there is an unexpected global development,” Turkey’s finance minister, Nureddin Nebati, wrote on Twitter. The blow of rising prices has fallen particularly hard on the poor and the middle class. More than half of working Turks earn around the minimum wage, which is worth less than $300 a month because of the Turkish lira’s vast devaluation against the dollar. As the lira has sunk, people have watched their salaries lose purchasing power and the value of their savings evaporate. “There is no way to earn a decent rate of return on what you have saved in this country, so there is this massive wealth destruction,” said Atilla Yesilada, an analyst with GlobalSource Partners. “I am sure there are winners in this, but the vast part of society is seeing their savings melt away by the day.” Turkey’s crisis has been years in the making, as political turmoil and what critics call Mr. Erdogan’s slide toward authoritarianism have made the country less attractive for many investors. Turkey has a substantial trade deficit and significant foreign debt, and the government has tapped its foreign currency reserves to try to slow the collapse of the currency. The coronavirus pandemic cut deeply into tourism income, and upheaval in global markets exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine made inflation a threat to economies around the globe. But while other countries raised interest rates to keep prices in check, Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly cut them. Last month, the International Monetary Fund recommended that Turkey raise the interest rate to counter inflation and grant more independence to its central bank, which is widely seen as doing Mr. Erdogan’s bidding. But in late November, the central bank lowered rates yet again, to 9 percent, the most recent of a series of cuts that have brought the rate down from 14 percent in August. In a range of interviews, Turks mourned the once-normal items that rising prices have turned into luxuries or pushed from their budgets altogether: chicken, weekend outings with their children, deodorant. “Every day, the money is melting,” said Mehmet Kaya, a car mechanic in Adana. The price of motor oil had gone up four times since the crisis began in 2018, he said, and prices had also risen for everything else he needed for his shop. At home, the amount of money required last year to fill his car’s trunk with groceries now bought only two bags. “I am very depressed, pensive, stressed out,” said Mr. Kaya, 40. In speeches and interviews, Mr. Erdogan has described low interest rates as part of a plan to foster economic growth by stimulating manufacturing and making Turkish products more attractive for export. He has blamed the country’s economic woes on unspecified foreign forces while suggesting that Turkish families are in fact better off than people in wealthier countries. Mr. Erdogan has tried to play down inflation, saying it is not a crippling economic threat and vowing that the government would take action against exorbitant price increases. “We expect from our citizens a bit more patience and strength,” he said in a televised statement last month. But in the U.S., inflation has fallen to under 8 percent annually, after interest rate increases, while yearly inflation in Turkey is more than 10 times that rate. To soften the blow, Mr. Erdogan’s government has increased the minimum wage twice since January, funded accounts to protect savings in local currency from devaluation, launched a multibillion-dollar housing subsidy program and backed other projects to help the poor. The economy has continued to grow, expanding by 11 percent in 2021, suggesting a recovery from the pandemic; economists expect more modest growth of around 5 percent this year. But the spiraling prices for many Turkish families threaten to tarnish the legacy of Mr. Erdogan, who was lauded during much of his two decades in power for overseeing vast economic growth that moved millions of Turks from poverty toward more comfortable, middle-class lifestyles. Many of those people now see those gains slipping away, which has damaged Mr. Erdogan’s political standing to such an extent that a number of polls now suggest that he could lose next year’s election. One recent poll by Mehmet Ali Kulat, who has consulted for both Mr. Erdogan’s governing party and members of the opposition, found that 36 percent of respondents said they would vote for Mr. Erdogan and 44 percent would vote against him, regardless of who his competitor was. Fourteen percent said they would decide based on who his challenger is, and 6 percent were undecided. In another recent poll by PanoramaTR, a risk analysis organization, about half of respondents said they would not vote for Mr. Erdogan and less than 35 percent said they would. The group also found that two potential challengers polled significantly higher than Mr. Erdogan. “It is mainly the economy,” said Osman Sert, the group’s research director and a former media adviser in Mr. Erdogan’s government. “If there were not an economic crisis, I do not think that Erdogan would be losing the election. The economy is making all the other problems visible.” Some analysts caution that much could change between now and the presidential and parliamentary elections to be held in or before next June. A new coalition of opposition parties challenging Mr. Erdogan has yet to choose a candidate and could struggle to remain unified. Mr. Erdogan has a long history as a deft political survivor and now sits at the top of a system that gives him tremendous power to make moves that could help him win votes. He can also count on a vast party infrastructure and a core base of loyal voters who will stick by him regardless of the economy. Melike, who cleans staircases to support her family in Istanbul, acknowledged that times were tough, pointing to a large crack in her worn-out shoes that she said she could not afford to replace. “I don’t buy anything for myself unless I have to,” said Melike, 33, declining to give her last name. “I buy for the children first.” But she didn’t blame Mr. Erdogan, saying that many countries were suffering from inflation and that unnamed “external powers” were making Turkey’s problems worse. “It is not about the rulers of this country,” she said. Also in Istanbul, three women in their 20s had spent the afternoon looking for an affordable watch for one of them — to no avail. All three worked to help their families and struggled to get by, they said. “My salary is gone in two days and then I live on the credit card,” said Bahar Ecevit, 24, a clerk in a clothing store. Prices had gotten so high in relation to her salary that she could not afford a new winter coat, she said. Like many young Turks, she hoped to move abroad and find a more secure future. “We are just living for the moment,” she said. “We don’t know what we will do tomorrow.” Safak Timur contributed reporting from Istanbul and Nimet Kirac from Adana, Turkey.

"74","Markets Drop as Investors Fear the Effects of Higher Rates","December 15, 2022 Thursday 23:06 EST","BUSINESS",632,"Isabella Simonetti","Central bankers around the world have pledged to continue raising interest rates even as economies slow.","Central bankers around the world have pledged to continue raising interest rates even as economies slow. Stocks tumbled on Thursday as investors feared that central banks were prepared to continue raising interest rates to bring down inflation despite signs that economies were already slowing. The S&amp;P 500 closed with losses of 2.5 percent, adding to a downturn that came after the Federal Reserve announced a half-point rate increase on Wednesday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 3.2 percent and is down about 31 percent since the beginning of the year. The Bank of England and European Central Bank on Thursday also raised their policy rates by half a point. “Risk aversion is returning as investors focus on global central bank tightening, rising recession risks and softer economic data, which suggests that the U.S. economy is seeing larger parts weaken now,” said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at the foreign exchange brokerage OANDA. Investors have been looking for signs that central banks will slow the pace of tightening. Even though the Fed and others this week announced smaller rate increases than in previous meetings, none were willing to declare victory over inflation. The Bank of England, which has raised rates in nine consecutive meetings, estimated that the British economy was already in recession, but pledged to “respond forcefully” if inflation proved persistent. The European Central Bank said that rates would “still have to rise significantly and at a steady pace” to tame price pressures. The drop in stocks pulled the index into a loss for the week. The S&amp;P 500 is down more than 18 percent since the beginning of the year. In addition, 10 of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index are down so far this year. Energy, the best-performing sector, is up more than 53 percent since January. On the other hand, the communication services sector, which includes companies like Walt Disney, Netflix and AT&amp;T, is down about 40 percent since the beginning of the year. “The markets continue to take two steps forward and three steps back and one step forward and two steps back,” said Ed Cofrancesco, the chief executive of the International Assets Advisory. “We believe that the market is going to continue to mambo and make lower lows and lower highs,” Mr. Cofrancesco said. “As part of that mambo, the market is going to overreact to good news and it’s going to overreact to bad news.” Policymakers at the Fed and other major central banks have expressed their determination to bring stubbornly high inflation under control by raising rates to cool their economies, even if that means higher unemployment and lower growth. When asked about the possible economic pain caused by the Fed’s policies, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said that a failure to rein in rising prices would be more painful. “We have more work to do,” Mr. Powell said on Wednesday, with forecasts by Fed officials suggesting that they expected rates to peak higher and remain elevated for longer than they previously predicted. That could squeeze the economy harder; worse-than-expected retail sales data released on Thursday showed that consumers were wary of spending in November, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season despite promotions like Black Friday. Britain’s FTSE 100 fell nearly 1 percent and the Pan-European Stoxx 600 dropped 2.9 percent. The yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note fell slightly. Oil prices traded lower while the dollar rose 0.8 percent against a basket of other major currencies. “Traders are still, though, taking a look at the big picture and we’re going to see a global economic slowdown in the first half of next year and I think the recession risks are elevated,” Mr. Moya of OANDA said.

"75","Retirees Are One Reason the Fed Has Given Up on a Big Worker Rebound","December 27, 2022 Tuesday 15:15 EST","BUSINESS; economy",1584,"Jeanna Smialek and Ben Casselman","Workers are in short supply three years into the pandemic job market rebound, and officials increasingly think they aren’t coming back.","Workers are in short supply three years into the pandemic job market rebound, and officials increasingly think they aren’t coming back. Alice Lieberman had planned to work for a few more years as a schoolteacher before the pandemic hit, but the transition to hybrid instruction did not come easily for her. She retired in summer 2021. Her husband, Howard Lieberman, started to wind down his consulting business around the same time. If Mrs. Lieberman was done working, Mr. Lieberman wanted to be free, too, so that the pair could take camping trips and volunteer. The Liebermans, both 69, are one example of a trend that is quietly reworking the fabric of the American labor force. A wave of baby boomers has recently aged past 65. Unlike older Americans who, in the decade after the Great Recession, delayed their retirements to earn a little bit of extra money and patch up tenuous finances, many today are leaving the job market and staying out. That has big implications for the economy, because it is contributing to a labor shortage that policymakers worry is keeping wages and inflation stubbornly elevated. That could force the Federal Reserve to raise rates more than it otherwise would, risking a recession. About 3.5 million people are missing from the labor force, compared with what one might have expected based on pre-2020 trends, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during a speech last month. Pandemic deaths and slower immigration explain some of that decline, but a large number of the missing workers, roughly two million, have simply retired. And increasingly, policymakers at the central bank and economic experts do not expect those retirees to ever go back to work. “My optimism has waned,” said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution. “We’re now talking about people who have reorganized their lives around not working.” Millions of Americans left or lost jobs in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic as businesses laid off employees, schools closed and workers stayed home. Child care disruptions, Covid-induced disability and other lingering effects of the pandemic have kept some people on the sidelines. But for the most part, workers went back quickly once vaccines became available and businesses reopened. Older workers were the exception. Among Americans ages 18 to 64, the labor force participation rate — the share of people working or actively looking for work — has largely rebounded to early 2020 levels. Among those 65 and up, on the other hand, participation lags well below its prepandemic level, the equivalent of a decline of about 900,000 people. That has helped to keep overall participation steadily lower than it was in 2020. “Despite very high wages and an incredibly tight labor market, we don’t see participation moving up, which is contrary to what we thought,” Mr. Powell from the Fed said during his final news conference of 2022, adding: “Part of it is just accelerated retirements.” As would-be employees stay out of work, the resulting labor shortages have reverberated through the economy. Consumers are still shopping, and understaffed firms are eager to produce the goods and services they demand. As they scramble to hire — there are 1.7 job openings for every jobless person in America — they have been raising wages at the fastest pace in decades. With pay climbing so swiftly, Fed officials worry that they will struggle to bring inflation fully under control. Wages were not a major initial driver of inflation but could keep it high: Businesses facing heftier labor bills may try to pass those costs along to their customers in the form of higher prices. That risk is why the Fed is focused on bringing the labor market back into balance, and it is what makes the wave of retirees particularly bad news. If America’s missing workers were just temporarily sidelined, waiting to spring back into jobs given enough opportunity and a safe public health backdrop, nagging labor shortages might fade on their own. But if many of the workers are permanently retired — as policymakers increasingly believe is the case — bringing a hot labor market back into balance will require the Fed to push harder. It can do that by raising rates to slow consumer spending and business expansions, tempering the economy and slowing hiring. But the process is sure to be painful and could even spur a recession. Having fewer workers available “lowers the landing pad that the Fed has to lower the economy onto,” Ms. Edelberg said. “Because of what’s happened in the labor force, they just have to soften growth even more.” The Fed has learned the hard way that it can be a mistake to declare too confidently that a wave of workers is gone for good. In the years after the 2008 recession, policymakers began to conclude that the economy would soon run low on fresh labor supply. They were wrong. Baby boomers, the huge generation of people born between 1946 and 1964, continued working later in life than previous generations had, providing an unexpected source of workers. Their importance is hard to overstate: The U.S. labor force grew by 9.9 million people between the end of the Great Recession and the start of the pandemic. Nearly 98 percent of that growth — 9.7 million people — came from workers 55 and older. Unfortunately, there are reasons to doubt that retirees will serve as a surprise source of job market fuel this time. Boomers were in their 50s and early 60s when the economy began to emerge from the Great Recession. Many weren’t yet ready to retire; others were just about to when the 2008 recession hit, eroding their savings. Many decided to delay retirements as the labor market strengthened in the 2010s: They were relatively young, and they often needed the cash. But key parts of that story have since shifted. The generation has aged, with older boomers now in their 70s and well over half in what would traditionally be considered their retirement years. That makes a difference. More than six in 10 people between the ages of 55 and 64 work or look for jobs, but nudge up the age scale even a little and that propensity to work drops drastically. Three in 10 people between the ages of 65 and 69 participate. Between 70 and 74, it is more like two in 10. In short, the demographic decks were always stacked for boomers to leave the labor market soon — but the pandemic seems to have nudged people who might otherwise have labored through a few more years over the cusp and into retirement. “It’s really coming from aging,” Aysegul Sahin, an economist at the University of Texas at Austin, said of the decline in participation, which she has studied. “It was baked in the cake after the baby boom that followed World War II.” People over 65 do not work much for a variety of reasons. Some want to enjoy their retirements. Others want or even need to work but cannot because of poor health. In the wake of the pandemic, seniors may also be particularly alert to the risk of virus exposure at work, given how much more deadly the coronavirus is for older people. “It could be that the oldest workers are more fearful of Covid,” said Courtney Coile, an economist at Wellesley College. “Only time is going to tell whether the working-longer trend is really going to continue.” Still other seniors may be opting out of work for a more pleasant reason: Many are in decent financial shape, unlike after the 2008 downturn. Families amassed savings during the pandemic thanks to both government stimulus payments and price gains in financial assets. It took until late 2010 for people between the ages of 55 and 69 to recover to their late-2007 wealth levels, according to Fed data. This time, an early-2020 hit had been fully recovered by June 2020. Financial wealth for that age group now stands about 20 percent above where it was headed into the pandemic, despite a recent market swoon. And while inflation is eroding spending power, Social Security payments are price-adjusted, which takes some of the sting away. The Liebermans in Pennsylvania, for instance, could go back to work part time if they needed to — but they do not expect to need to. “Unless inflation went really ballistic, I think we’d be OK,” Mr. Lieberman said. To be sure, while retirements could help keep workers in short supply across America, other factors could bolster the work force. Immigration, for instance, is rebounding. And some data paint a more optimistic picture of the labor force: Monthly payroll figures from the Labor Department, which are based on a survey that’s separate from the demographic statistics, show that companies have continued to add jobs rapidly despite their complaints about a worker shortage. “Listening to Jerome Powell talk about labor supply, he seems resigned to the idea that there’s nothing left,” said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab. “There are more workers out there who can get hired and want to get hired.” But central bankers have to make best guesses about what will come next, and, so far, they have determined that an increase in labor supply big enough to cool down the hot labor market is unlikely. “For the near term, a moderation of labor demand growth will be required to restore balance to the labor market,” Mr. Powell said last month."

''The proverbial 'Santa Claus' rally, which since 1950 has statistically returned approximately 1.3-1.8 percent nearly 80 percent of the time, has looked as though Santa has taken an early vacation,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.   Investors are in the middle of a mostly quiet and holiday-shortened week. Markets were closed on Monday for the observed Christmas holiday and there are no major economic reports expected this week.   A report from the National Association of Realtors showed that the housing market continued cooling amid high prices and steeper interest. Pending home sales fell 4 percent in November.   The report weighed down homebuilders. Toll Brothers fell 2.4 percent.   U.S. crude oil prices settled 0.7 percent lower and natural gas prices plunged 10.8 percent. That hurt energy stocks. Exxon Mobil fell 1.6 percent.   Southwest Airlines slid 5.2 percent as the carrier grappled with the fallout after cancelling thousands of flight cancellations. The airline's C.E.O. said it could be next week before the flight schedule returns to normal. Shares in other airlines also fell. Delta Air Lines dropped 2.8 percent and United Airlines fell 2.4 percent.   Tesla rose 3.3 percent as it stabilized from steep losses it suffered after reports Tuesday that it temporarily suspended production at a factory in Shanghai.   The Chinese government announced late Tuesday that it will start issuing new passports, a major step away from anti-virus travel barriers that likely will bring a flood of tourists out of China for next month's Lunar New Year holiday. China has already said it will drop most of its Covid-19 travel restrictions next month.   Hong Kong's Hang Seng climbed 1.6 percent, while the Shanghai Composite index dropped 0.3 percent.   Markets in Europe closed mostly lower.   In the U.S., the S&P 500 fell 46.03 points to 3,783.22. The Dow dropped 365.85 points to close at 32,875.71. The Nasdaq slid 139.94 points to 10,213.29. The Russell 2000 gave up 27.49 points to finish at 1,722.02.   Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which influences mortgage rates, rose to 3.88 percent from 3.85 percent Tuesday. The yield on the two-year Treasury fell to 4.34 percent from 4.38 percent late Tuesday.   Wall Street remains on edge and will likely continue dealing with volatile trading as the Federal Reserve continues its fight against stubbornly hot inflation. The Fed and other central banks have been raising interest rates to stifle borrowing and slow spending in order to tame inflation. The strategy, though, risks slowing the economy too much and bringing on a recession. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/28/business/29markets.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page B2."
"79","Skyrocketing Prices in Turkey Hurt Families and Tarnish Erdogan","December 5, 2022 Monday","Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 6",1401,"Ben Hubbard",NA,"Annual inflation is at its highest level in decades, devaluing salaries and devouring savings less than a year before President Recep Tayyip Erdogan runs for re-election. ISTANBUL -- As Turkey's annual inflation rate has soared above 80 percent, families are being forced to stick with worn-out clothes and shoes and to cut meat from their diets while some struggle to afford school lunches for their children.    Exacerbating the country's worst inflation crisis in more than two decades, economists say, are the unorthodox financial policies of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has insisted on lowering interest rates in defiance of a broad economic consensus that inflation is best controlled by raising them.   The belt-tightening is so severe that it has soured many voters on Mr. Erdogan, Turkey's paramount politician for nearly two decades, leaving him politically vulnerable as he prepares to run for re-election next year.   ''Living conditions are difficult, paying rent is difficult, paying at the market is difficult -- everything is difficult,'' said Ese Gucer, a resident of the southern city of Adana who has long voted for Mr. Erdogan and his party. ''My faith in Erdogan has been shaken because of the economy,'' added Ms. Gucer, 32. ''He lost me.''   Year on year, inflation rose to 85 percent in October, the highest rate in 24 years, according to government figures. Some economic monitors say the real rate for many of Turkey's roughly 85 million people is much higher.   The blow has fallen particularly hard on the poor and the middle class.   More than half of working Turks earn around the minimum wage, which is worth less than $300 a month because of the Turkish lira's vast devaluation against the dollar. As the lira has sunk, people have watched their salaries lose purchasing power and the value of their savings evaporate.   ''There is no way to earn a decent rate of return on what you have saved in this country, so there is this massive wealth destruction,'' said Atilla Yesilada, an analyst with GlobalSource Partners. ''I am sure there are winners in this, but the vast part of society is seeing their savings melt away by the day.''   Turkey's crisis has been years in the making, as political turmoil and what critics call Mr. Erdogan's slide toward authoritarianism have made the country less attractive for many investors. Turkey has a substantial trade deficit and significant foreign debt, and its foreign currency reserves have declined as the government has tapped them to try to slow the collapse of the currency.   The coronavirus pandemic cut deeply into tourism income, and upheaval in global markets exacerbated by Russia's war in Ukraine made inflation a threat to economies around the globe.   But while other countries raised interest rates to keep prices in check, Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly cut them.   Last month, the International Monetary Fund recommended that Turkey raise the interest rate to counter inflation and grant more independence to its central bank, which is widely seen as doing Mr. Erdogan's bidding. But in late November, the central bank lowered rates yet again, to 9 percent, the most recent of a series of cuts that have brought the rate down from 14 percent in August.   In a range of interviews, Turks mourned the once-normal items that rising prices have turned into luxuries or pushed from their budgets altogether: chicken, weekend outings with their children, deodorant.   ''Every day, the money is melting,'' said Mehmet Kaya, a car mechanic in Adana.   The price of motor oil had gone up four times since the crisis began in 2018, he said, and prices had also risen for everything else he needed for his shop. At home, the amount of money required last year to fill his car's trunk with groceries now bought only two bags.   ''I am very depressed, pensive, stressed out,'' said Mr. Kaya, 40.   In speeches and interviews, Mr. Erdogan has described low interest rates as part of a plan to foster economic growth by stimulating manufacturing and making Turkish products more attractive for export. He has blamed the country's economic woes on unspecified foreign forces while suggesting that Turkish families are in fact better off than people in wealthier countries.   Mr. Erdogan has tried to play down inflation, saying it is not a crippling economic threat and vowing that the government would take action against exorbitant price increases.   ''We expect from our citizens a bit more patience and strength,'' he said in a televised statement last month.   But in the U.S., inflation has fallen to under 8 percent annually, after interest rate increases, while yearly inflation in Turkey is more than 10 times that rate.   To soften the blow, Mr. Erdogan's government has increased the minimum wage twice since January, launched a multibillion-dollar housing subsidy program and funded other projects to help the poor. The economy has continued to grow, expanding by 11 percent in 2021, suggesting a recovery from the pandemic; economists expect more modest growth of around 5 percent this year.   But the spiraling prices for many Turkish families threaten to tarnish the legacy of Mr. Erdogan, who was lauded during much of his two decades in power for overseeing vast economic growth that moved millions of Turks from poverty toward more comfortable, middle-class lifestyles.   Many of those people now see those gains slipping away, which has damaged Mr. Erdogan's political standing to such an extent that a number of polls now suggest that he could lose next year's election.   One recent poll by Mehmet Ali Kulat, who has consulted for both Mr. Erdogan's governing party and members of the opposition, found that 36 percent of respondents said they would vote for Mr. Erdogan and 44 percent would vote against him, regardless of who his competitor was. Fourteen percent said they would decide based on who his challenger is, and 6 percent were undecided.   In another recent poll by PanoramaTR, a risk analysis organization, about half of respondents said they would not vote for Mr. Erdogan and less than 35 percent said they would. The group also found that two potential challengers polled significantly higher than Mr. Erdogan.   ''It is mainly the economy,'' said Osman Sert, the group's research director and a former media adviser in Mr. Erdogan's government. ''If there were not an economic crisis, I do not think that Erdogan would be losing the election. The economy is making all the other problems visible.''   Some analysts caution that much could change between now and the presidential and parliamentary elections to be held in or before next June.   A new coalition of opposition parties challenging Mr. Erdogan has yet to choose a candidate and could struggle to remain unified. Mr. Erdogan has a long history as a deft political survivor and now sits at the top of a system that gives him tremendous power to make moves that could help him win votes.   He can also count on a vast party infrastructure and a core base of loyal voters who will stick by him regardless of the economy.   Melike, who cleans staircases to support her family in Istanbul, acknowledged that times were tough, pointing to a large crack in her worn-out shoes that she said she could not afford to replace.   ''I don't buy anything for myself unless I have to,'' said Melike, 33, declining to give her last name. ''I buy for the children first.''   But she didn't blame Mr. Erdogan, saying that many countries were suffering from inflation and that unnamed ''external powers'' were making Turkey's problems worse.   ''It is not about the rulers of this country,'' she said.   Also in Istanbul, three women in their 20s had spent the afternoon looking for an affordable watch for one of them -- to no avail. All three worked to help their families and struggled to get by, they said.   ''My salary is gone in two days and then I live on the credit card,'' said Bahar Ecevit, 24, a clerk in a clothing store. Prices had gotten so high in relation to her salary that she could not afford a new winter coat, she said.   Like many young Turks, she hoped to move abroad and find a more secure future.   ''We are just living for the moment,'' she said. ''We don't know what we will do tomorrow.''

"80","A Strong Signal That Recession Is Looming; peter coy","December 21, 2022 Wednesday 14:25 EST","OPINION",988,"Peter Coy","What the relative yields of two Treasury securities say about the future.","The clearest signal that the U.S. economy is likely to fall into a recession in the next year is coming from interest rates. One of the first people to establish the signaling value of interest rates was Arturo Estrella, then an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. I interviewed him recently about his life, his research and what he foresees for the economy. Before I get to Estrella, though, here’s the chart that has a lot of economists, including him, deeply worried. It shows the path of yields this year on two Treasury securities, the three-month bill and the 10-year note. More than 90 percent of the time the yield on the shorter-term security is lower than the yield on the longer-term security. When the pattern flips, as it did this year, it’s a strong signal that a recession is nigh. Using monthly averages for the two securities, Estrella calculates that there’s about a 95 percent chance of a recession in the coming year. (Other economists analyze different pairs of securities, such as two-year versus 10-year notes, and consequently get slightly different results.) To see why Estrella is so certain, picture a narrow band where short- and long-term rates are roughly equal. Inside that band, it’s hard to say what will happen to the economy. But things are much clearer when there’s a noticeable gap between short- and long-term rates, in either direction. Estrella has calculated that going back to 1968, every time the long-term rate was at least 0.07 percentage points higher than the short-term rate, the economy escaped recession. And every time the long-term rate became at least 0.07 percentage points lower than the short-term rate, the economy entered a recession within six to 17 months. The average gap so far in December is 0.81 percentage points, which is the biggest since 1981 and deep into recessionary territory. Why would the “inversion of the yield curve,” as the flipping phenomenon is called, tell us anything about the economic outlook? It’s pretty simple, actually. The Federal Reserve has strong influence over short-term interest rates. When it raises them — usually to snuff out inflation — it makes borrowing more expensive, which often goes too far and causes a recession. At the same time, longer-term rates can decline because of expectations of lower inflation or a decline in the “real” (inflation-adjusted) rate of interest. Those expectations intensify when a recession appears likely. A 1989 New York Fed research paper by Estrella and Gikas Hardouvelis, later published in The Journal of Finance, established statistically that an inversion of the yield curve predicted recessions. Campbell Harvey of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business produced similar results around the same time. (There’s a long-running disagreement about who was first, which I won’t attempt to adjudicate.) Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University economist who spent time as Estrella’s boss when Mishkin was the New York Fed’s research director, told me: “Arturo was a top intellect. Boy, he really had the goods.” Estrella has a story about how he accidentally angered E. Gerald Corrigan, who was the president of the New York Fed at the time. A Fed governor in Washington had put out a request for research on whether there was predictive power in the yield curve and Corrigan put his people to work on it, hoping to show that the answer was no. Not knowing of Corrigan’s preferences, Estrella innocently reported in a big meeting that yes, indeed, his research showed that the yield curve had predictive power. “His reaction was not something you can print in the paper,” Estrella said. “I thought I was going to get fired. A few months later, I was transferred to bank supervision.” (Albeit with a promotion.) Estrella told me his interest in the predictive power of interest rates dates back to his childhood in San Juan, P.R., where he attended Catholic schools. “My math teacher was a nun,” he said. “She was also in charge of the music program. We hit it off very well.” He earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy at Columbia with a special interest in Ludwig Wittgenstein, the kind of philosopher beloved by the technically minded. He followed that with master’s degrees in math at the University of Puerto Rico and the University of Michigan and a doctorate in economics at Harvard. Estrella left the Fed in 2008 and taught at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., until 2018, when he took emeritus status. I asked him what he thinks of the Fed’s aggressive rate increases. “It’s a very difficult line to draw, whether something is necessary to control inflation or not,” he said. “I don’t know if what they’re doing right now is necessary. My gut feeling is that they’re going too far.” Elsewhere: More Jobs Are ‘Age-Friendly’ About three-quarters of occupations in the United States became more “age-friendly” between 1990 and 2020, but a lot of the new jobs were filled by young people, according to a working paper released on the National Bureau of Economic Research website in September. “Many of these age-friendly jobs have been taken up by females and college graduates, as the occupational characteristics preferred by older workers (e.g., flexibility, office work, less strenuous demands, etc.) also appeal to these groups,” wrote Daron Acemoglu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nicolaj Sondergaard Muhlbach of Aarhus University in Denmark and Andrew J. Scott of London Business School. Quote of the Day “‘Innovation’ and ‘creativity’ are now tedious obligations of every middle manager and worker, having lost whatever modernist zeal they once had.” — William Davies, “Economic Science Fictions” (2018) This article has been updated to reflect a debate over which scholars first showed that an inverted yield curve can predict recessions."
"81","Treasury Outlines Broad Rules for New Corporate Tax on Stock Buybacks","December 28, 2022 Wednesday","Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 16",657,"Jim Tankersley",NA,"The preliminary guidance applies to an alternative minimum tax for large corporations and a tax on stock buybacks, which helped fund President Biden's climate and health bill. WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department on Tuesday set broad rules for a new tax on stock repurchases that had been created under a law signed by President Biden earlier this year, largely rejecting business lobbyists' efforts to narrow its scope.    The initial guidance was issued ahead of more detailed regulations that are expected to be released early next year. Tax experts said it was likely to yield more revenue for the federal government than if officials had granted business groups' request to carve particular types of buybacks out of the tax.   The department also released initial guidance on Tuesday for a second, further-reaching tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act: an alternative minimum tax on large corporations that use deductions and credits in the tax code to reduce their effective federal tax rates below 15 percent. The corporate income tax rate has been set at 21 percent since 2018, when a sweeping set of tax cuts signed by President Donald J. Trump took effect.   The minimum tax guidance sets criteria for which companies must pay that new tax. ''Critically,'' Treasury officials wrote in a news release, ''it also gives smaller corporations an easy method for demonstrating that the new alternative minimum tax does not apply to them.''   The buybacks tax was included as one of several revenue raisers in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law over the summer. The act seeks to reduce prescription drug prices for seniors on Medicare and decrease premiums for some Americans who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It also includes $370 billion in tax credits and federal spending meant to encourage the deployment of low-emission energy technologies to fight climate change.   The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which provides official estimates of tax policies in Congress, projected that the buybacks tax would raise nearly $74 billion over the course of a decade.   Business groups had sought to whittle that number down, by excluding certain types of buybacks from the tax. Treasury officials appeared to agree to only one of them, which concerns SPACs: special purpose acquisition companies, which sell shares to investors and use the money to buy operating businesses.   If a SPAC forms but cannot find a company to buy within two years, it must return investors' money to them -- effectively buying back their shares. The Treasury guidance does not treat that liquidation as subject to the buyback tax. But otherwise, the guidance rejects industry attempts to narrow its scope.   ''Treasury and the I.R.S. could have written these regulations narrowly to apply only to paradigmatic buybacks -- corporations repurchasing their own common stock on the open market,'' said Daniel Hemel, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. ''Unhappily for Wall Street -- but happily from a revenue perspective -- Treasury chose to define the scope of the tax much more broadly.''   Mr. Hemel noted that the guidance was in contrast with the department's decision on Friday to delay by a year a new reporting requirement for users of Venmo, PayPal and a variety of other tech platforms. A provision in the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion economic legislation Mr. Biden signed soon after taking office in 2021, was set to begin forcing those tech platforms to report small transactions to the I.R.S., a change that stoked fears of surprise tax bills for individual taxpayers and drew heavy opposition from small businesses and large tech companies alike.   It is ''hard to tell a story about Treasury and the I.R.S. going narrow or going broad'' on tax implementation issues under Mr. Biden, Mr. Hemel said. ''It's going in different directions on different issues.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/27/us/politics/treasury-rules-corporate-taxes.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page A16."
"82","States' Stimulus Aid Props Up Residents' Incomes, but Could Lift Prices, Too","December 2, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3",663,"Alan Rappeport",NA,"Efforts around the country to ease the pain of rising prices have given consumers more money to spend, which could paradoxically further drive up prices. WASHINGTON -- For months, economists have warned that efforts by states to buffer their constituents from rising prices with tax rebates and stimulus checks might, paradoxically, make inflation worse by giving consumers more money to spend.    New income data released Thursday suggests that the state help is, in fact, making a difference to consumers by notably boosting their incomes. That could fan price increases going forward if it helps to fuel continued solid spending.   According to the report, personal income climbed by 0.7 percent in October, notably more than the 0.4 percent the previous month, partly because of increases in government social benefits that ''primarily'' reflected ''one-time refundable tax credits issued by states,'' the report said.   Solid income gains -- which are also being fueled by higher wages and salaries -- could give consumers more confidence to keep opening their wallets as they head into the holiday season. That could in turn give companies the ability to continue charging more for goods and services at a time when inflation is proving stubbornly rapid.   Prices as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures index rose by 6 percent in the year through October, according to a report from the Commerce Department. That was a slower increase than in the month before, but inflation remains three times the Federal Reserve's target despite hopeful recent signs that it is beginning to moderate.   How much state help will fuel consumption -- and future price increases -- is an open question.   Tracking the value of refundable tax credits provided by the states can be complicated. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said that it relied on media reports and ''state-level administrative data'' to estimate the value of these one-time tax credits that were granted this year.   As part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan that Democrats in Congress passed last year, states, counties and cities were granted $350 billion in stimulus money. Although the law restricted states from using the funds to subsidize tax cuts, the courts have blocked that requirement and many state lawmakers -- Republicans and Democrats -- have opted to use budget surpluses to cut taxes or grant tax credits.   Economists have been fearful that additional stimulus funds will fan inflation by giving people more money to spend and enabling them to bid up prices for goods and services. Since states have enacted different policies at different times throughout the past year, it is hard to pinpoint the precise impact that local relief efforts are having on the national economy.   Through mid-July, 10 states had enacted individual income tax rate cuts, six states had passed corporate income tax rate reductions, five states suspended their gasoline taxes, and two states exempted groceries from sales taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. Direct tax rebates were also popular, with 11 states returning surplus revenue to taxpayers.   Additional tax cuts are in the works in the states, despite concerns that inflation could remain high.   Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Republican of Virginia, said last week that he intended to pursue tax cuts in his budget proposal next year.   This week, Gov. Ned Lamont of Connecticut, a Democrat, signed legislation to extend gas tax cuts and pandemic premium pay.   ''We're extending the gas tax holiday a little bit longer, providing energy assistance for those in need and increasing the amount of funding available for the pandemic pay program for the essential workers who've showed up to work every day throughout the pandemic,'' Mr. Lamont said in a statement. ''During the upcoming regular session, it is my goal to continue advancing more policy changes like these that will make a difference in the lives of the people who live here.'' https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/01/business/state-tax-cuts-inflation.html  Graphic"

(Dec. 4-10) Workers’ Frustrations With Wages A wave of strikes and other labor actions began in September in Britain, largely set off by workers’ frustrations that wages were not keeping up with soaring inflation. That wave is now intensifying, with hundreds walking off the job last week. About 600 workers with a nonprofit housing organization began a two-week strike, 200 employees of a brewing company went on strike and several dozen employees at a pickle factory walked out. (That could mean beer and pickle shortages over the holidays, according to the union that represents these workers.) But that may be just the beginning: Workers across industries including health care and transportation are poised to go on strike, and labor actions are planned every day through Christmas. The central issue in most cases remains pay, particularly in the public sector as the British government under Prime Minister Rishi Sunak seeks to make drastic budget cuts. Mr. Sunak has said he is working on “tough new laws” against these strikes. Relief at the Gas Pump Traveling this winter — if you are going by car — is likely to be much more affordable than it was over the summer, when gasoline prices in the United States reached a record national average of $5 a gallon. Last week, the national average price for gas fell to $3.33 a gallon, according to AAA, almost exactly where prices stood a year ago, when the national average was $3.34. The prices have been sent lower by a decline in worldwide energy demand and falling oil prices just in time for the holiday season. It is a rare bright spot for consumers who are still experiencing uncomfortably high prices elsewhere in the economy even as inflation is beginning to loosen its grip. But that could all change, as China eases its Covid restrictions and oil supplies tighten because of the new embargo on Russian oil.

But as the country begins to roll back those measures in response to widespread protests, economic uncertainty remains. Analysts say consumer spending is unlikely to quickly rebound after being stifled for so long, and the country is facing a housing crash as well as weakening demand from trading partners that may be approaching recessions.

But they may be pleased with the outcome of the Fed’s meeting on Wednesday, as Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, has signaled that policymakers would begin to moderate their approach. Analysts expect an increase of half a percentage point, as compared with the three-quarters of a percentage point raises at the last four meetings. As the Fed has tried to cool off demand and slow down the economy, it has been conscious of the fact that it could go too far and tip the country into a recession. “My colleagues and I do not want to over-tighten,” Mr. Powell said last month. Fresh Inflation Data Ahead of Wednesday’s Fed meeting, officials will get one last piece of data to fill in the picture of the economy’s direction. The Consumer Price Index on Tuesday is expected to show inflation continuing to moderate, with analysts predicting that prices in November climbed 7.3 percent, down from 7.7 percent in October. Last month’s report was an encouraging development for both American consumers and Fed officials, who had begun to worry that inflation was becoming more entrenched and feeding on itself in a wage-price spiral, in which high prices prompt wage increases that then lead to even higher prices.  Congressional Hearings on FTX The fallen crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to appear before the House Committee on Financial Services this week to answer lawmakers’ questions about the stunning implosion of the crypto exchange he founded, FTX. But even as he said he was willing to testify, promising to shed light on topics including what led to the crash and how his own failings contributed, Mr. Bankman-Fried curbed expectations with warnings that he “wouldn’t be as helpful” as he would like to be. He has also dodged similar requests from the Senate Banking Committee to testify, and the chairman of that panel, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has told Mr. Bankman-Fried that he is prepared to compel his testimony by subpoena if he did not respond. These hearings are only a fraction of the array of inquiries the young crypto founder is facing worldwide, as investigators try to learn more about how billions of dollars of customers’ money disappeared.

Last month's report was an encouraging development for both American consumers and Fed officials, who had begun to worry that inflation was becoming more entrenched and feeding on itself in a wage-price spiral, in which high prices prompt wage increases that then lead to even higher prices.    Congressional Hearings on FTX   The fallen crypto mogul Sam Bankman-Fried has agreed to appear before the House Committee on Financial Services this week to answer lawmakers' questions about the stunning implosion of the crypto exchange he founded, FTX. But even as he said he was willing to testify, promising to shed light on topics including what led to the crash and how his own failings contributed, Mr. Bankman-Fried curbed expectations with warnings that he ''wouldn't be as helpful'' as he would like to be. He has also dodged similar requests from the Senate Banking Committee to testify, and the chairman of that panel, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, has told Mr. Bankman-Fried that he is prepared to compel his testimony by subpoena if he did not respond. These hearings are only a fraction of the array of inquiries the young crypto founder is facing worldwide, as investigators try to learn more about how billions of dollars of customers' money disappeared.   What Else?   Morgan Stanley is laying off 2 percent of its global work force. On Wednesday, Ramesh Balwani, Elizabeth Holmes's No. 2 at the failed blood start-up Theranos, was sentenced to almost 13 years in prison for fraud. And Janet L. Yellen became the first female Treasury secretary to have her signature on U.S. bank notes, which were unveiled on Thursday. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/09/business/the-week-in-business-labor-britain.html  Graphic    This article appeared in print on page BU2."
"85","Ambulance Workers Go on Strike in U.K., Disrupting Hospitals","December 22, 2022 Thursday","Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 10",832,"Isabella Kwai",NA,"The industrial action, seeking higher pay and better working conditions, was driven by a cost-of-living crisis and coincides with strikes by rail workers, nurses and others. Thousands of ambulance workers in England and Wales went on strike on Wednesday, walking out on their shifts and joining picket lines to demand pay increases and better working conditions in the largest labor unrest to hit Britain's emergency services in decades.    The walkout, an effort by three unions that was expected to include over 20,000 workers, is the latest labor strike across numerous industries in recent weeks in Britain as a mounting cost-of-living crisis, spurred by double-digit inflation, grips the country. On Tuesday, nurses went on strike over pay that has not kept up with inflation, and rail workers and border control workers are scheduled to do the same this week.   In the ambulance services, workers have raised alarms about record delays for patients seeking emergency treatment, and paramedics have pointed to staffing shortages and burnout, as well as fears of arriving too late to help some callers.   Those issues have been exacerbated by entrenched problems within the National Health Service, where a high level of staffing vacancies has led to backlogs and long waits in hospital emergency rooms. Health workers are exhausted after working under highly stressful conditions during the pandemic, which also put their own lives at risk, and amid years of austerity measures that hollowed out public services after the 2009 financial crisis.   ''We just cannot deal with the volume of calls,'' said Antonia Gosnell, 53, who has worked as a paramedic for 33 years and was on a picket line in South London on Wednesday afternoon. ''They all came out clapping for us during the pandemic, and now there's nobody here to listen to what we want.''   Throughout the day, the ambulance services were prioritizing the most critical cases. Before the walkout, some hospitals asked people to arrange their own transportation to hospitals, including pregnant women going into labor. Patients needing nonurgent care were advised to look elsewhere for advice, including by telephone or from general practitioners or pharmacists.   With Christmas and end-of-year celebrations underway, health leaders urged people to avoid risky behavior on a day when services would be stretched. ''Don't get so drunk that you end up with an unnecessary visit to A. & E.,'' Stephen Powis, the N.H.S. medical director for England, said in a BBC interview, referring to the Accident and Emergency departments at hospitals.   The health service's management said before the strike that there was ''deep worry'' about potential harm to patients at a time when the service was already under intense pressure.   ''This is not something N.H.S. leaders would ever say lightly, but some now tell us that they cannot guarantee patient safety tomorrow,'' Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the N.H.S. Confederation, which represents the service's organizations in England, said on Tuesday.   The N.H.S. planned to manage the walkouts by calling in military personnel and volunteers, increasing staffing at call centers and discharging patients from hospitals where possible to free up beds for patients arriving in the reduced number of ambulances that were operating.   Unions representing ambulance workers blamed the government for the impasse. Workers argue that a pay increase of 1,400 pounds -- about 2 to 7 percent -- proposed by a government review body amounts to a cut in real terms. Inflation in the country has soared to as much as 11.1 percent in recent months, the highest in four decades.   ''None of them want to be here, but if we don't take a stand now, the ambulance service will just crumble and die,'' Christina McAnea, the general secretary of Unison union, said from a picket line in South London.   In a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, N.H.S. England leaders said that on health grounds ''it is clear that we have entered dangerous territory.''   ''We urge you to do all you can to bring about an agreed solution,'' they said. ''Otherwise more members of the public will suffer unnecessarily.''   Mr. Sunak has called the industrial action disappointing and threatened to impose laws that would limit the reach of trade unions.   Despite worries over the strikes' impact, some people affected by delays in ambulance services expressed sympathy for the workers.   In North London, a local resident, Robin Lockyer, 65, said while walking to work on Wednesday morning that his father had been forced to wait seven hours for an ambulance after breaking his hip recently. ''He's 86 -- it was really traumatic for him,'' Mr. Lockyer said. ''But I don't blame the ambulance service,'' he added. ''I blame the government.''   ''The government is taking a strange stance,'' Mr. Lockyer said. ''And I think there's going to be a lot more action.''

"86","Treasury Department Outlines Rules for New Corporate Taxes","December 27, 2022 Tuesday 23:49 EST","US; politics",658,"Jim Tankersley","The preliminary guidance applies to an alternative minimum tax for large corporations and a tax on stock buybacks, which helped fund President Biden’s climate and health bill.","The preliminary guidance applies to an alternative minimum tax for large corporations and a tax on stock buybacks, which helped fund President Biden’s climate and health bill. WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department on Tuesday set broad rules for a new tax on stock repurchases that had been created under a law signed by President Biden earlier this year, largely rejecting business lobbyists’ efforts to narrow its scope. The initial guidance was issued ahead of more detailed regulations that are expected to be released early next year. Tax experts said it was likely to yield more revenue for the federal government than if officials had granted business groups’ request to carve particular types of buybacks out of the tax. The department also released initial guidance on Tuesday for a second, further-reaching tax included in the Inflation Reduction Act: an alternative minimum tax on large corporations that use deductions and credits in the tax code to reduce their effective federal tax rates below 15 percent. The corporate income tax rate has been set at 21 percent since 2018, when a sweeping set of tax cuts signed by President Donald J. Trump took effect. The minimum tax guidance sets criteria for which companies must pay that new tax. “Critically,” Treasury officials wrote in a news release, “it also gives smaller corporations an easy method for demonstrating that the new alternative minimum tax does not apply to them.” The buybacks tax was included as one of several revenue raisers in the Inflation Reduction Act, which Mr. Biden signed into law over the summer. The act seeks to reduce prescription drug prices for seniors on Medicare and decrease premiums for some Americans who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It also includes $370 billion in tax credits and federal spending meant to encourage the deployment of low-emission energy technologies to fight climate change. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, which provides official estimates of tax policies in Congress, projected that the buybacks tax would raise nearly $74 billion over the course of a decade. Business groups had sought to whittle that number down, by excluding certain types of buybacks from the tax. Treasury officials appeared to agree to only one of them, which concerns SPACs: special purpose acquisition companies, which sell shares to investors and use the money to buy operating businesses. If a SPAC forms but cannot find a company to buy within two years, it must return investors’ money to them — effectively buying back their shares. The Treasury guidance does not treat that liquidation as subject to the buyback tax. But otherwise, the guidance rejects industry attempts to narrow its scope. “Treasury and the I.R.S. could have written these regulations narrowly to apply only to paradigmatic buybacks — corporations repurchasing their own common stock on the open market,” said Daniel Hemel, a New York University law professor who specializes in tax law. “Unhappily for Wall Street — but happily from a revenue perspective — Treasury chose to define the scope of the tax much more broadly.” Mr. Hemel noted that the guidance was in contrast with the department’s decision on Friday to delay by a year a new reporting requirement for users of Venmo, PayPal and a variety of other tech platforms. A provision in the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion economic legislation Mr. Biden signed soon after taking office in 2021, was set to begin forcing those tech platforms to report small transactions to the I.R.S., a change that stoked fears of surprise tax bills for individual taxpayers and drew heavy opposition from small businesses and large tech companies alike. It is “hard to tell a story about Treasury and the I.R.S. going narrow or going broad” on tax implementation issues under Mr. Biden, Mr. Hemel said. “It’s going in different directions on different issues.” This article appeared in print on page A16."

Kramer","Unable to roll over debt accumulated before the war, Ukraine has paid investors more than it has collected this year, the Central Bank says.","Unable to roll over debt accumulated before the war, Ukraine has paid investors more than it has collected this year, the Central Bank says. KYIV, Ukraine — The Ukrainian government has struggled to raise money on bond markets during the war and is paying investors more than it is collecting, according to a Central Bank statement that points to the country’s deepening dependence on foreign aid. About a fifth of Ukraine’s territory is occupied by Russian forces. Pivotal sectors like steel manufacturing and agriculture have been directly damaged by the war. And with cruise missile volleys hitting cities throughout Ukraine, tremendous uncertainty looms over all of the country’s businesses. The economy has been projected to shrink about 40 percent this year, drying up tax revenue and indefinitely delaying previously planned spending that would have spurred growth. The Central Bank statement, published on Monday, pointed to a less visible side of Ukraine’s financing shortfalls caused by the war: an inability to raise money on the market. Since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, Ukraine has not been able to roll over debt accumulated before the war. The country paid investors about $2.2 billion more than it collected in bond sales in that time, the Central Bank said. All of that has left Ukrainian public finance, which has been wobbly at the best of times in the post-independence period, deeply reliant on assistance from the United States, the European Union, European countries that donate individually and other donors. The finance ministry sold $6.7 billion in bonds during that period despite fighting in southeastern Ukraine, missile strikes in the capital and the Russian military’s advancement to within about a dozen miles of central Kyiv in the first month of the war. Much of those sales were considered politically driven — with investors wanting to assist the government or unable to invest elsewhere because of capital controls. The rate the finance ministry pays on government debt is below market, given the risks and other more market-driven indicators of what borrowing costs are expected to be. In a peculiarity of Ukraine’s wartime monetary policy, the Central Bank has maintained a lending rate, averaging about 25 percent, far higher than Ukrainian bond yields, which have been about 15 percent. Ukraine’s moves to cover deficits over the summer by printing money to pay soldiers’ salaries and cover other wartime costs drove up inflation. Now, the Central Bank is striving to tamp down inflation, while the government is seeking lower rates to reduce borrowing costs. The budget passed by Ukraine’s Parliament for next year includes a deficit of about $36 billion. About half of the planned expenditures are for the army, the police and other military outlays. The deficit this year has run even higher, at about $5 billion a month. The International Monetary Fund, which bailed out Ukraine through a long run of post-independence financial crises, has not continued large-scale lending during the war. “They are worried about debt sustainability,” said Tymofiy Mylovanov, a former economy minister who is a professor at the Kyiv School of Economics. “If the I.M.F. is worried about debt sustainability and ability to finance, imagine what private investors are thinking.” After waves of Russian missile strikes on Ukraine’s energy grid, about nine million people have been left without electricity, President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Monday. Blackouts have brought economic activity to a near standstill in some towns. Donors weighing the cost of defending Ukraine must also consider the potential cost of continued instability in Eastern Europe if Ukraine remains unstable, Mr. Mylovanov said. “Ukraine will be a net recipient of foreign aid for a long, long time, and in very substantial amounts exactly because it will be critical for European security,” he said. But prolonged instability in Europe would be more costly than propping up Ukraine’s government, he said."

The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Thursday that Austan D. Goolsbee will become its next president, taking a seat at the central bank’s policy-setting table as officials work to bring down the fastest inflation in decades. Mr. Goolsbee, who was a member and later chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration between 2009 and 2011, has long been a faculty member at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. He has a doctorate in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and studied for his undergraduate degree at Yale. He will replace Charles Evans, who has been in the role since 2007 and at the Chicago Fed since 1991 and is retiring. The Chicago Fed district is made up of Iowa and most of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin. The Fed’s 12 presidents oversee large staffs of researchers and bank supervisors and vote on monetary policy on a rotating basis. Mr. Goolsbee will vote on policy in 2023, meaning that he will be an important voice at the table as the Fed continues its effort to wrangle rapid inflation and tries to decide just how aggressive a policy response that will require. He is expected to start on Jan. 9. “These have been challenging, unprecedented times for the economy,” Mr. Goolsbee said in the statement from the Chicago Fed announcing the decision. “The bank has an important role to play.” Mr. Goolsbee warned in an opinion column last year that using past economic experiences to understand pandemic-era inflation and labor market changes would be a mistake. “Past business cycles look nothing like what the United States has gone through in the pandemic,” he wrote. “The most interesting questions aren’t really about recession and recovery. They center on whether any of the pandemic changes will last.” He also participates in surveys of economic experts carried out by the Chicago Booth Initiative on Global Markets, which offers a snapshot of some of his thoughts on relevant topics including inflation and the growing divide between the rich and the poor. Early this year, he noted that corporate profit margins have increased — a sign that companies are increasing prices by more than their costs are climbing — but said that they had not shot up enough to explain inflation. In response to a question about whether price controls could be used to contain prices, he wrote: “Just stop. Seriously.” In another Booth poll, asked if “the increasing share of income and wealth among the richest Americans is a major threat to capitalism,” he responded: “Duh.” While many economists responded to Mr. Goolsbee’s appointment positively, there was some backlash. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, has been pushing the Fed to appoint Latino leaders. He said the  selection process — which is run by the local business and nonprofit leaders who sit on a regional bank’s board — is antiquated and opaque. The result risks “perpetuating a legacy that has shut out Latinos from the upper echelons of leadership at the Fed,” Mr. Menendez said in a statement."

"90","U.S. Gas Prices Are Now Lower Than a Year Ago","December 8, 2022 Thursday 10:44 EST","BUSINESS; energy-environment",938,"Isabella Simonetti","A visible symbol of inflation for much of the year, prices at the pump have been driven down by reduced global demand and tumbling oil prices.","A visible symbol of inflation for much of the year, prices at the pump have been driven down by reduced global demand and tumbling oil prices. After months in which gasoline prices in the United States have been one of the most visible symbols of inflation, they have a new distinction: Prices at the pump are now lower than they were a year ago.  The reversal of the price escalation that accompanied Russia’s invasion of Ukraine will ease pressure on American consumers dealing with the high cost of other essentials. The drop in gasoline prices was led by a decline in worldwide energy demand, which drove oil prices lower. The national average price for regular gasoline stood at $3.33 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. A year ago, the average price at the pump was $3.34. At their peak, gasoline prices were just over $5 a gallon in mid-June. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the U.S. benchmark that serves as the main driver of gas prices, on Thursday fell to its lowest level of the year, crossing below $72 per barrel, after trading above $120 in March and June. The drop is a political boon for the Biden administration, which has been drawing down the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve since the spring in an effort to keep prices contained. Although gasoline prices have fallen from recent peaks, they are still higher than they were throughout the past several years. Along with elevated oil and natural gas prices, this has powered a series of record-breaking quarterly profits at energy companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The net income of global oil and gas producers is set to double this year, to an “unprecedented” $4 trillion, the International Energy Agency said in a recent report. President Biden has criticized energy companies for “profiteering” and threatened them with a new windfall profits tax, a policy already in place in some other parts of the world, unless they increased production. His administration has been highlighting the price declines on social media. Falling gasoline prices may be welcome news for the Federal Reserve, too, as it tries to curb inflation by raising interest rates and slowing down the economy. Still, the economic implications could be complicated. As consumers spend less on gasoline, they have more cash for other purchases. “It’s good for households and it’s good for affordability,” said Beth Ann Bovino, the U.S. chief economist at the financial analysis firm S&amp;P Global. “But at the same time the easing up of pricing pressure at the gas pump leaves more money to spend elsewhere, that might give a near-term boost to inflation, which the Fed would have to fight.” The gasoline price trend has not been matched by diesel, a fuel essential to industry, agriculture and transporting goods. U.S. diesel prices have fallen in recent weeks, but are roughly 40 percent higher than a year ago, partly because of disruptions to Europe’s supplies. While the decline in gasoline prices has been widely felt, some states still have prices well above the national average. In California, which has high gasoline taxes and rigorous emissions standards that increase the cost of refining, the average price of regular gasoline was $4.62 a gallon on Thursday, down from $6.44 in June. In several Southern and Midwestern states, however, prices are below $3 a gallon, mainly because they have minimal gasoline taxes, if any, and demand is lower in rural areas, according to Devin Gladden, an AAA spokesman. Global oil prices account for more than half the cost of gasoline. The prices of both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, the global benchmark, have fallen more than 20 percent since late August, as Covid-19 lockdowns in China reduced demand. AAA expects gasoline prices to continue to decline through the end of the month, Mr. Gladden said, partly because winter-blend gasoline has fewer environmental restrictions, making it cheaper to produce. But U.S. gasoline prices frequently decline in December before rising in January. And factors beyond the United States — including the Ukraine war and the decelerating world economy — make the outlook for the new year uncertain. “We just have to continue watching oil prices because they remain volatile and as we saw in the spring, if oil prices spike to $100 per barrel, gas prices will follow suit,” he said. “A lot will depend on how the geopolitical tension continues to unfold throughout the winter.” A further easing of China’s pandemic restrictions, for example, could prompt a rise in demand that would drive up oil prices. On Wednesday, the Chinese government loosened some of its rules after protests against its “zero Covid” policy.  A drop in oil supplies could also push prices up. OPEC and its allies, including Russia, trimmed production in October, and affirmed these targets at a meeting on Sunday. An embargo on Russian oil imports by the European Union also took effect this week, as did an elaborate plan to cap the price of Russian oil, led by the Group of 7 industrial nations. “We think the market may be underestimating Russia’s resolve to reduce output and exports in response to the E.U. embargo and the price cap,” said Tatiana Orlova, the lead economist at Oxford Economics, noting that oil prices were likely to rise in the coming weeks if Russian exports were to fall. “The stage is set for a spike in oil prices,” said Bryan Benoit, the U.S. national managing partner of energy at the accounting firm Grant Thornton.

For years, iPhone customers who visited the App Store found apps priced at 99 cents, $1.99 and $9.99. The pricing was part of Apple’s policy of restricting what developers could charge. Now, 15 years after the App Store was created, the company is ditching those limitations and allowing apps to choose from nearly 600 pricing options, including the simple fee of $1, Apple said on Tuesday. Rising inflation around the world has put pressure on Apple and developers to be more flexible in what they charge customers. The company also continues to face a backlash from developers, regulators and lawmakers around the world over its App Store policies. The App Store is the only gateway for thousands of apps to reach iPhone users, making Apple an arbiter of software distribution. Last year, Apple agreed to introduce more flexible App Store pricing in the settlement of a class-action lawsuit brought by developers, who accused the company of having a monopoly on the distribution of iPhone apps. The new prices will range from 29 cents to $10,000, a break from the previous range of 99 cents to $999.99, Apple said. The prices will roll out for subscription apps this week and be available for other apps next year. The $10,000 ceiling could be a sign that Apple anticipates higher-priced offerings, said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies. Apple is developing a virtual- and augmented-reality headset that blends the digital world with the real world, and Ms. Milanesi said the video games and entertainment options on that new device could cost more. “I don’t know if seats courtside for a basketball game on a headset will cost more than a real game or not, but they could,” she said. Adjusting prices country by country and managing foreign exchange rates will be made easier, Apple said. Some app developers set one subscription price for the world and focus on developed markets such as the United States, Europe and Japan. But Matt Ronge, founder of Astropad, an app that turns the iPad into a drawing tablet, said Apple’s increased flexibility could allow him to expand into new markets. “If you can charge a more reasonable price in India, it could open up some possibilities,” Mr. Ronge said. “Any time they open it up in any way, I’m a fan.” As Congress wraps up its year, among the bills under consideration is the Open Markets Act, which seeks to give developers more control over their apps and allow them to skirt the fees — as much as 30 percent — that Apple and Google charge developers.

Why Elon Musk might be taking on Anthony Fauci  Since taking over Twitter, Elon Musk has shown a willingness, and sometimes a relish, to pick public fights with an array of targets, including advertisers, tech giants, employees and more. But over the weekend, Musk publicly attacked two figures, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Yoel Roth, Twitter’s former head of trust and safety, in ways that may resonate with far-right audiences and gin up user engagement — but are likely to deter wary advertisers from flocking back to the social network anytime soon. “My pronouns are Prosecute/Fauci,” Musk tweeted on Sunday, scoring points with both critics of the use of nonbinary pronouns and of Mr. Fauci, America’s top immunologist, who disagreed with President Donald Trump on how to reopen the country in 2020. Mr. Musk has previously criticized pandemic lockdowns, having defied one that affected Tesla’s factory in California, and remote work. (Mr. Fauci himself wrote in a Times Opinion guest essay how political divisiveness has hampered public health campaigns.) Musk’s tweet drew predictable responses, including support from far-right figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and rebukes from Democratic lawmakers like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Some on Twitter noted that Musk’s own predictions about the pandemic fell drastically short of reality. Mr. Musk also spread misinformation about Mr. Roth, misleadingly suggesting that the former Twitter executive’s doctoral thesis advocated for child sexualization. The move opened up Mr. Roth — whom Mr. Musk had publicly supported in the first days of his Twitter ownership, before Mr. Roth quit — to online abuse. Musk says that he has focused relentlessly on improving public safety on Twitter, and accused previous management of failing to do so. But Jack Dorsey, the company’s co-founder and former C.E.O., disputed that assertion. And three members of Twitter’s Trust &amp; Safety Council announced their resignation last week, citing the company’s increased reliance on automated content moderation. Is Musk banking on conservative engagement to help Twitter’s business? Musk has pointed to some metrics showing that user engagement is up since he took over. The billionaire may well be politically conservative, but evidence of his actual positions isn’t very clear. In any case, his actions — which also include leaking internal Twitter correspondence about topics like Hunter Biden to sympathetic journalists including Matt Taibbi and Bari Weiss — have certainly succeeded in winning over right-leaning users and conservative politicians. But Mr. Musk’s shock tactics don’t seem to be designed to bring back advertisers who paused spending on Twitter amid the chaos during his takeover. (Apple, which was the target of a brief Musk campaign but which hasn’t halted ads on the platform, declined to comment to DealBook on Musk’s latest tweets.) That puts additional importance on Twitter’s efforts to expand revenue beyond ads, including the revamped Twitter Blue subscription service that is set to debut today. Nor do they seem likely to endear the company to prospective recruits who may already be wary of workplace culture changes that Mr. Musk has wrought. Insider noted that employees had warned prospective hires via the anonymous employer-rating site Blind to stay away from the company and its “toxic” environment. Mr. Musk certainly didn’t win over the crowd at a Dave Chappelle comedy show on Sunday in San Francisco: He was heavily booed after making a surprise appearance onstage. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING  Microsoft buys a 4 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange Group. The American software giant acquired the stake from a group led by Thomson Reuters and Blackstone, as part of a $2.8 billion deal that will have the exchange rely on Microsoft’s cloud services. It follows similar business partnerships by other exchanges, including Nasdaq (with Amazon) and CME Group (with Alphabet). Amgen agrees to buy Horizon Therapeutics for $27.8 billion. The all-cash deal for Horizon, which produces treatments for autoimmune diseases, is the biggest health care transaction of the year. In beating out rivals like Johnson &amp; Johnson and Sanofi, Amgen is paying a nearly 20 percent premium to Horizon’s stock price on Friday. European lawmakers grapple with a Qatar bribery scandal. Over the weekend, the Belgian authorities charged four people with corruption in connection with an investigation into suspected bribes by the Gulf state to current and former members of the European Parliament. The scandal comes as Qatar hosts the men’s soccer World Cup. Britain prepares for national paralysis over strikes. The British government is drawing up contingency plans, including intervention by the military, to deal with work stoppages across a variety of sectors, including rail and nursing, through the end of the year. Union members have demanded higher wage increases to keep up with inflation. Covid, inflation and interest rates buffet global markets  December has been a downer for investors so far, and this morning is looking no different. Stock markets from Hong Kong to London are in the red on Monday, as are U.S. futures ahead of a big week of data releases and interest rates decisions. Stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai closed lower on Monday as concerns grow over the rate of Covid infections in major Chinese cities, after Beijing suddenly eased many of its zero-Covid restrictions. That is feeding into global slowdown fears, which are affecting energy prices. As of 7 a.m. Eastern, Brent crude was down roughly 0.7 percent. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen in nine of the past 11 trading sessions, as recession and inflation fears mount, pushing investors to pare their stock holdings. The benchmark index slumped 3.4 percent last week, its worst weekly performance since September, according to Deutsche Bank equities analysts. Energy, bank and tech stocks have been hit particularly hard, with the Nasdaq composite index falling 4 percent so far this month. Investors are bracing for another volatile week. Markets will be closely watching Tuesday’s latest Consumer Price Index report for signs that consumer inflation has peaked. And on Wednesday, the Fed will announce what is expected to be a 0.5 percentage point interest rate increase. That same afternoon, the Fed chair, Jay Powell, will deliver his latest assessment of the economy, and is expected to signal the central bank’s policy moves for next year. It’s a similar picture in Europe. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England will also deliver rates decisions this week, and similarly sized increases are expected. And investors will be tracking consumer price data releases from France, Germany and the U.K., where soaring energy and food prices have pushed core inflation to multidecade highs. FTX’s C.E.O. showdown  As two congressional committees gear up to scrutinize the multibillion-dollar collapse of crypto empire FTX this week, its fallen founder, Sam Bankman-Fried, still seems to believe in the future of the company, and in his role as a business leader. Mr. Bankman-Fried hopes to start a new venture, he toldthe BBC on Saturday, explaining that the goal would be to repay FTX investors. The comments were made a day after he weighed in on a proposal to revive FTX by issuing a new version of the exchange’s token, FTT, writing on Twitter that it would be “a productive path for parties to explore!” The price of FTT rose on his tweet, but the statements would have come as little consolation to FTX’s million creditors. “I won’t be as helpful as I’d like,” Bankman-Fried warned. He is scheduled to testify on Tuesday before the House Financial Services Committee, but the former FTX chief executive said there were limits on what he would be able to say because he does not have access to all of his personal or professional data. It’s not clear whether Mr. Bankman-Fried, who is known as S.B.F., will appear in person. He has also not yet accepted a request to talk to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. Staying silent may be difficult. The hearing will pit Mr. Bankman-Fried against John Ray, the restructuring expert and current FTX C.E.O. who is managing the bankruptcy and labeled FTX the worst case of corporate failure he had ever seen. S.B.F. has pushed back against that characterization, claiming Mr. Ray made “false” statements in court filings about FTX’s failure. Mr. Ray reportedly met with Manhattan prosecutors last week. They are apparently looking into suspicious transfers to the Bahamas on the eve of FTX filing for bankruptcy, among other aspects of the collapse. Other executives are being more circumspect. At least in public. Caroline Ellison, the former C.E.O. of Alameda Research, FTX’s sister trading firm that allegedly used FTX customer funds to back its very risky bets, has stayed quiet — even as Bankman-Fried has tried to shift blame on to her.  Ms. Ellison has reportedly hired a former S.E.C. official steeped in crypto cases, Stephanie Avakian, as her lawyer. Last week, Ms. Ellison was reportedly spotted in a coffee shop not far from the offices of federal prosecutors in Manhattan, giving rise to speculation that she may be cooperating with their investigation. Here’s what else is happening in crypto today: South Korean prosecutors believe that the crypto fugitive Do Kwon, who is wanted in the $60 billion collapse of the TerraUSD and Luna tokens, is hiding in Serbia. Investors are pulling record amounts from crypto coins following the collapse of FTX. And most major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are trading lower this morning. “There’s a risk of a recession. But … it certainly isn’t, in my view, something that is necessary to bring inflation down.”  — Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen believes inflation will fall considerably in 2023. The less-good news: she acknowledges that a downturn in the U.S. economy is a possibility. The week ahead  Three major central banks — the Fed, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England — will set interest rates this week. And there is fresh inflation data coming from the U.S. and Europe. Tuesday: The U.S. and German consumer price index data for November come in, and the FIFA semifinals begin (Argentina vs. Croatia). Wednesday: Wall Street analysts expect the Fed to raise interest rates by half of a percentage point, less than the three-quarters of a point hike it announced at its last four meetings. Elsewhere: Britain’s C.P.I. for November; and Inditex, the Spanish retailing group, reports quarterly results. Thursday: The E.C.B. and B.O.E. are also expected to raise rates by half of a percentage point. Elsewhere: China reports industrial production and retail sales. U.S. retail sales for November are due. Adobe earnings. Friday: Congress must reach a deal on funding the federal government beyond this week. Elsewhere: Accenture earnings.

But he's back in a big way. There's a narrow window when most American children believe in Santa. It's around 3, 4, 5 years old. Six to eight is starting to push it. Which is to say that, for many families, the pandemic nearly ruined the limited opportunity to get that photo with the child sitting on Santa's lap in complete awe.    Christmas 2020 was a washout. Christmas 2021 was muted by the Omicron wave. But this Christmas, seemingly everyone wants a piece of Santa: the vaccine-boosted who've shaken off pandemic precaution, the companies and stores hungry to lure workers and shoppers back in, the families whose 5-year-olds will soon start shrugging at all of this.   Those parents especially, ''they want to get Santa,'' said Stephen Arnold, a Memphis Santa and the president of the International Brotherhood of Real Bearded Santas. And they're willing to go to great lengths to get Santa. ''That desperation,'' he said, ''leads to what we're perceiving as increased demand.''   Santa bookings are way up across the big platforms that help companies hire them and families find them. Santa's wages are up. And not just up, but as best as we can tell they're up more than the pay bumps most workers have seen, and, yes, more than inflation.   On GigSalad, an online marketplace for event workers that annually books thousands of Santa gigs, Santa's average pay for an event this year -- home visits, corporate parties, photo studio assignments -- is about $275, up around 12 percent from last Christmas. That's an imperfect proxy for the whole Santa industry. But we take what we can when the Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn't track Santa as an occupation. (The wage growth is also in line with what we've heard from other Santa sources.)   For every new Santa looking to sign up this year with HireSanta, another major booking platform, 20 new clients are hoping to hire one, said Mitch Allen, the company's founder and head elf. The demand is more than double prepandemic levels.   ''People are trying to call up on Monday and think they can get a Santa to come to their house on Friday, Saturday, Sunday,'' said Howie Graham, Santa at a Bloomingdale's in New York City. Unfortunately, that is not how Santa works. Santa's December weekends were booked months ago.   Nick Gillotte, a Santa in Danbury, Conn., used to start booking photo studios for family Santa shoots around the beginning of September. This year those slots began to fill up in May. And his prices are up ''significantly.''   The reason? According to Santa, it's Econ 101: ''The pent-up demand has increased people who want me,'' Mr. Gillotte said. ''And I only have a limited amount of time.''   Santa has been dealing with inflation, too. He has to buy gas, liability insurance, maybe a new belt this year. And salon services to whiten a naturally brown beard aren't cheap.   That Santa is in hot demand this year makes sense. Certain kinds of jobs were devastated early in the pandemic: service-sector roles that didn't work well in virtual or remote settings and that depended on in-person contact. Think restaurant servers, bartenders, salon workers.   As pandemic restrictions eased and consumers shifted from buying goods to more services, these same jobs prompted widespread for-hire signs and higher pay. The trend has meant that relatively lower-paying service-sector jobs in leisure and hospitality have been among the few whose wages have outpaced inflation this year.   Santa has the quintessential version of this kind of job -- one that lost much of its value amid social distancing but now commands an in-person premium. What Santa sells is as in-person as it gets: You climb into his lap, you tug on his beard, and you lean in close enough to whisper that you're really hoping for a toy drone that opens up to release lots of tiny drones (or, rather, that's what your 5-year-old does).   This did not translate well to social distancing, on top of the median Santa's particular Covid risk. Mr. Arnold, of the Real Bearded Santas, estimates that more than half of the group's 2,000-plus members did no Santa work in 2020 (many Santas are otherwise retired and on Social Security). It was also hard for Santa to do his job using traditional personal protective equipment, like masks. For one Christmas tree lighting event in 2020, Mr. Arnold greeted families from inside a giant snow globe.   Other Santas worked behind plexiglass, or ''one reindeer apart, as we like to say in the Santa world,'' said Tim Connaghan, who runs a Santa school and serves as the national Santa face of Toys for Tots. (A reindeer, if you did not know, is roughly six feet long.)   Some Santas tried going virtual. But the technological leap could be a big one for some among a population largely over 65. Mr. Gillotte, a relatively young Santa at 58, led training sessions for Santas on how to conduct virtual visits.   ''Because so many guys were having trouble with green screen stuff,'' he said, ''we started to transition them to 'just decorate a wall.'''   This strange time has in some ways led to a lasting expansion in Santa's business, another reason things are booming today. Some Santas who figured out the virtual visit still offer it. A few of Santa's tricks actually work better that way (it's easier to perform magic virtually, or to glance at notes with all the children's names and wish lists).   That means some families who could never reach Santa now can. And other families who previously thought Santa worked only at the mall discovered during the pandemic that he did home visits, too. That kind of Santa work is in big demand.   Of course, it's hard to say if there will be such good times for Santa next year. The economy might sour, or the pent-up demand may recede. But there have been dark days before, even plagues and pandemics, said Mr. Connaghan, who last week was in the middle of a run of Santa appearances with Mariah Carey.

A bribery case rocks the European Parliament A high-profile bribery case, built by the Belgian authorities over more than a year with the help of their secret services, has uncovered what prosecutors say was a cash-for-favors scheme at the heart of the E.U. It has highlighted the vulnerabilities in an opaque, notoriously bureaucratic system that decides policies for 450 million people in the world’s richest club of nations. Now, Eva Kaili, a Greek politician and a vice president of the European Parliament, is in jail, accused of trading political decisions for cash. The Belgian authorities charged her last weekend alongside her partner, Francesco Giorgi, and two others in an investigation into Qatari influence. Police raids uncovered €1.5 million in cash. Weeks earlier, she had been spotted in the ultra-selective V.V.I.P. box at the World Cup in Qatar. That same week, in Brussels, she delivered an impassioned defense of the Middle Eastern nation against criticism of its exploitation of migrant workers who had built the tournament’s stadiums, chastising Qatar’s critics as bullies. Response: Kalli’s lawyer, Michalis Dimitrakopoulos, said she was innocent. “She simply had no knowledge of the cash,” he said. “She did Qatar no favors at all, because all her positions were, in fact, in line with E.U. policy on Qatar.” Go deeper: The Times spoke to two dozen lawmakers, E.U. and Belgian government officials, and aides directly familiar with the case and the people involved, and examined private correspondence, years of social media posts, policy drafts and voting records. The U.S. will train Ukrainian troops The Pentagon plans to train 600 to 800 Ukrainian troops — one battalion — each month in advanced battlefield tactics at a base in Germany, starting next year. The expanded effort would focus on advanced tactics and would seek to bolster the offensive skills of a military that has mostly adopted defensive positions. The Pentagon has already trained 610 Ukrainians to operate an advanced rocket launcher. The troops have used the system to devastating effect, hitting targets far behind Russian lines. The new initiative will involve training bigger groups of Ukrainians on various strategies, such as coordinating ground infantry troops with artillery support. The decision to step up training comes as the administration is poised to send a Patriot antimissile battery, America’s most advanced ground-based air defense system, in response to urgent demands from Kyiv. In other news from the war: Reporters for The Times accompanied a surveillance team for the Ukrainian Army as they used a thermal sight to find enemy positions miles away. A Russian broadcaster plucked clips from U.S. cable news, right-wing social media and Chinese officials to spin a counternarrative that Russia is winning in Ukraine, leaked emails revealed. The U.S. announced new sanctions on prominent Russians. Interest rates rise in Europe The European Central Bank, the Swiss Central Bank and the Bank of England all raised interest rates by half a percentage point, after three-quarters-of-a-point increases at previous meetings, in an effort to tame inflation. Each central bank stressed that it was in a continuous battle against stubbornly high inflation. In the eurozone, “interest rates will still have to rise significantly at a steady pace” to make sure they are restrictive enough to return inflation to the central bank’s 2 percent target in a “timely” manner, the E.C.B. said in a statement yesterday. Most members of the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee said they expected that more increases would be needed to curb inflation. The longer-term picture is more complicated: Europe’s economies are decelerating because of high energy costs and the effects of months of rate increases, which have made mortgages and other loans more expensive. Policymakers have been trying to calibrate the right amount of monetary tightening needed to bring down inflation despite the economic slowdown. By the numbers: The Bank of England started raising rates a year ago and, over the course of nine consecutive policy meetings, has lifted rates from 0.1 percent to 3.5 percent, the highest since 2008. Consumer prices in Britain rose 10.7 percent in November from a year earlier, down slightly from 11.1 percent in October, the highest annual rate since 1981.

The club is named after Ned Ludd, the folkloric 18th-century English textile worker who supposedly smashed up a mechanized loom, inspiring others to take up his name and riot against industrialization. “It’s a little frowned on if someone doesn’t show up,” one member said. “We’re here every Sunday, rain or shine, even snow.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Friday that the person was killed in a crash involving a 2002 Honda Accord when the driver's airbag inflater ruptured and hurled shrapnel.   Honda said the crash occurred on Feb. 22 in Bowling Green, Ky.   The death, which was recently confirmed, brings the number of people killed by the airbags to 33 worldwide, including up to 24 in the U.S.   Takata used ammonium nitrate to create a small explosion to inflate air bags in a crash. But the chemical can become more volatile over time when exposed to moisture and repeated high temperatures.   The explosion can rupture a metal canister and hurl shrapnel into the passenger compartment.   ASSOCIATED PRESS   Agriculture   Bigger Drop Is Expected For Florida Orange Crop   Production of oranges in Florida this season is forecast to be down 36 percent from earlier estimates, in part a reflection of twin hurricanes that battered growing regions, according to U.S. Agriculture Department figures released on Friday.   The latest forecast calls for about 18 million boxes of oranges to be produced in 2022-2023 in the state, compared with agency estimates of 28 million in October that did not account for damage caused by Hurricanes Ian and Nicole.   The most recent numbers show a drop of 56 percent in Florida orange production compared with last season, agriculture officials said. The boxes generally weigh about 90 pounds.   The harvest was 41 million boxes in 2021-2022 and more than 67 million the season before that.   Other citrus crops are also forecast to be down, with grapefruit production coming in at 200,000 boxes fewer than estimated in October and 100,000 fewer boxes of tangerines and tangelos.   ASSOCIATED PRESS   Economy   Wholesale Prices Increase At a Lower Rate Again   Wholesale prices in the U.S. rose 7.4 percent in November from a year earlier, a fifth straight slowdown and a sign of inflation pressures continuing to cool.   The latest year-over-year figure was down from 8 percent in October and from a recent peak of 11.7 percent in March. On a monthly basis, the government said on Friday that its Producer Price Index, which measures costs before they reach consumers, rose 0.3 percent from October to November for the third straight month.   Still, a measure of ''core'' producer prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs, accelerated, rising 0.4 percent from October to November. The core figure had risen just 0.1 percent from September to October. Looked at over the past 12 months, though, core producer prices were up 6.2 percent in November, less than the 6.7 percent in October.

The markets can’t figure out Powell  Global markets are showing red on Thursday as investors grow concerned about just how far central banks will push up interest rates to tame inflation. The Bank of England on Thursday raised its prime lending rate by 0.5 percentage points, and the European Central Bank is expected to follow suit with a similar increase. The market volatility was on full display on Wednesday in the U.S. Stocks jumped at the open as investors anticipated that Jay Powell, the Fed chair, would signal that the central bank would soon pull back on its policy of aggressive rate increases. But he did the opposite, and stocks slumped. In his afternoon news conference, Mr. Powell said emphatically that “we have more to do” to bring inflation down to the Fed’s target rate of 2 percent. The Fed now forecasts it will raise its policy interest rate to 5.1 percent by the end of 2023. (It’s currently set to a range between 4.25 to 4.5 percent.) Many on Wall Street still think the Fed won’t go that far. “This aggressive hiking cycle is going to cause some damage,” Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in an investor note on Wednesday evening. (RBC thinks the Fed will cut rates twice next year.) Meanwhile, Bill Ackman, the widely followed hedge fund billionaire, tweeted Wednesday that the Fed’s 2 percent inflation target “is no longer credible.” Porcelli believes the Fed’s current plan risks pushing the world’s biggest economy into recession. Powell’s response on Wednesday to the recession question: “It’s not knowable.” But Porcelli thinks Powell is “watering down the recession risk” and playing up the inflation risk, perhaps to justify the hawkish rhetoric on rate increases. Asia also slumped on Thursday. Stocks in Hong Kong fell 1.6 percent after Beijing disclosed that industrial output and retail sales for November came in below analyst expectations, as the costs of the country’s (now largely eased) zero-Covid policy have become clearer. Researchers in Hong Kong say China could see nearly 1 million Covid deaths as it changes policy on fighting the virus. HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING  Goldman Sachs is reportedly cutting banker bonuses by at least 40 percent. The firm is considering the sharpest drop in payouts since the financial crisis. Some executives are worried that such steep cuts, which would be deeper than those of its rivals, could lead to a swell of banker departures. Influencers are charged with running a $100 million “pump-and-dump” scheme. Eight men who collectively were known as FinTwit were sued by the S.E.C., which accused them of touting penny stocks to their social-media followers — only to sell them without warning as the shares’ prices rose. Vanguard is excused from a Texas hearing on E.S.G. investing. The asset manager will escape what’s likely to be a grilling by Texas lawmakers after it quit a global business alliance focused on climate change. Other firms, including BlackRock and State Street, are still slated to testify about their approach to investing in fossil-fuel companies. Long Covid has contributed to over 3,500 deaths in the U.S. The finding by C.D.C. researchers is the first official tally of the condition’s toll. Long Covid comprises various ailments whose causes still aren’t known. The C.D.C. warned that it may still be undercounting deaths attributable to long Covid, since it’s hard to identify. The S.E.C.’s market makeover  Nearly two years after a meme-stock frenzy blasted a hole in many investors’ trading portfolios, the S.E.C. wants to introduce the biggest changes in over a decade to how the stock market operates. Atop its list would be changing “payment for order flow.” Brokerages like Robinhood, Schwab and Ameritrade, which were at the center of the meme-stock mayhem, credit the practice — which involves selling customer trades in bulk to a market maker like Citadel or Virtu — with making their commission-free trading business model possible, and bringing a new generation of Americans into day trading.  Retail traders have long been suspicious of whether P.F.O.F. gives them a good price for their trade, however. Gary Gensler, the S.E.C. chair, seems to be in their corner. “Zero commission doesn’t mean zero cost,” he has said. Mr. Gensler had threatened to ban P.F.O.F., which would have been detrimental to the likes of Robinhood. In recent quarters the popular stock-trading app has earned more than half its revenue from the practice, which generated billions for such brokerages during the bull market years. Under the proposal unveiled Wednesday, most retailer investors’ trades would be funneled into a kind of auction where customers could get more visibility into how the trade execution price was set.  The hope is that the added transparency would bring more competition, and better prices for the trading public, with the S.E.C. estimating that the plan could improve prices for investors by $1.5 billion a year.  The auction model is just one of four new S.E.C. proposals on the table. “With so many moving parts, it is difficult to determine the net effect, and I worry we might not realize the unintended consequences until it’s too late,” Brett Redfearn, former director of the Division of Trading and Markets at the S.E.C., told DealBook. Brokers and market makers plan to push back. The changes may “hurt millions of retail investors,” said Lucas Moskowitz, head of government affairs at Robinhood Markets. He accused the S.E.C. of “playing politics with individual Americans’ ability to improve their financial lives.” If the rules are approved, legal challenges appear likely. In the interim, opponents are coordinating their efforts during the 60-day public comment period. A top FTX executive blew the whistle  As Sam Bankman-Fried sits behind bars in a Bahamian jail, how the 30-year-old one-time crypto mogul ended up there is becoming a bit clearer. Among the latest revelations: One of his former lieutenants at his crypto exchange, FTX, cooperated with authorities in the run-up to his empire’s collapse. Ryan Salame, the co-C.E.O. of FTX, told Bahamian regulators on Nov. 9 that Bankman-Fried had likely transferred customer money to Alameda Research, the company’s trading affiliate. Salame’s allegation spurred the authorities into action, and they soon appointed liquidators for FTX. That disclosure, in a court filing in the Bahamas, is the first documented sign that an ally of Bankman-Fried — or S.B.F., as he’s known — has turned on him. But the fact that S.B.F. is the only FTX or Alameda executive facing charges so far suggests that other former executives may also be cooperating with law enforcement, perhaps including his close ally Caroline Ellison, who led Alameda. In other crypto news: A Github account created by a senior FTX executive appears to have housed code that helped mask huge debts at Alameda, according to Bloomberg. S.B.F. is no longer listed on the website of the Giving Pledge, a group of billionaires who have committed to giving away most of their fortunes to charity. A hearing on crypto held by the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday shows how lawmakers remain split on how to regulate the industry. “2023 will be a year of growth; it’s just that not all growth is up and to the right.”  — Aryeh Bourkoff, the C.E.O. of the merchant bank LionTree, forecasting in an annual letter to investors that he sees continued uncertainty in the year ahead — not all of it bad.  Elon Musk goes back to the Tesla well  If Tesla shareholders were already worried that Elon Musk is too distracted by his work at Twitter, they now have more reason to be upset: Mr. Musk disclosed Wednesday that he had sold another $3.6 billion worth of Tesla stock, possibly to prop up his embattled social network. Mr. Musk has now sold $23 billion worth of Tesla stock this year, much of it after he pledged in April to stop selling shares to finance his Twitter deal. Musk hinted at what he was up to on Tuesday, tweeting, “Beware of debt in turbulent macroeconomic conditions, especially when Fed keeps raising rates.” That suggests he either plans to buy back some of Twitter’s billions in debt — including the $13 billion it took on as part of his takeover — or, perhaps less likely, buy back some of the company’s equity. None of this will reassure Tesla shareholders who are fretting over the 61 percent drop in the carmaker’s stock price this year — and a C.E.O. who has admitted to spending nearly all of his time at Twitter nowadays. Leo KoGuan, one of Tesla’s biggest individual investors, tweeted Wednesday, “Tesla needs and deserves to have working full-time C.E.O.” Meanwhile, Mr. Musk has been busy suspending more accounts at Twitter. Most notable among them was @ElonJet, the brainchild of Jack Sweeney, a 20-year-old college student who drew on public data to track Musk’s private jet.  The move marks a shift in Mr. Musk’s approach to Sweeney, after the billionaire — a self-proclaimed free speech absolutist — initially pledged not to suspend the @ElonJets account. (On Wednesday, Musk said he would take “legal action” against Sweeney.) As The Times notes, Twitter justified suspending the accounts based on a change in its rules that appears to have been implemented only within the last 24 hours. A new poll suggests some C.E.O.s remain wary of what Mr. Musk is doing at Twitter. At the invitation-only Yale C.E.O. Summit held this week, attendees were asked to weigh in on top business topics. Here’s where those leaders came down on some of them: 56 percent of respondents said companies should stop advertising on Twitter (though a majority later said their own companies hadn’t). 69 percent said they believed Twitter’s best days were behind it, while 79 percent said Musk had become a detriment to the value of his companies.

"98","U.S. Gas Prices Are Now Lower Than a Year Ago","December 9, 2022 Friday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 1",939,"Isabella Simonetti",NA,"A visible symbol of inflation for much of the year, prices at the pump have been driven down by reduced global demand and tumbling oil prices. After months in which gasoline prices in the United States have been one of the most visible symbols of inflation, they have a new distinction: Prices at the pump are now lower than they were a year ago.The reversal of the price escalation that accompanied Russia's invasion of Ukraine will ease pressure on American consumers dealing with the high cost of other essentials.    The drop in gasoline prices was led by a decline in worldwide energy demand, which drove oil prices lower. The national average price for regular gasoline stood at $3.33 a gallon on Thursday, according to AAA. A year ago, the average price at the pump was $3.34.   At their peak, gasoline prices were just over $5 a gallon in mid-June. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil, the U.S. benchmark that serves as the main driver of gas prices, on Thursday fell to its lowest level of the year, crossing below $72 per barrel, after trading above $120 in March and June.   The drop is a political boon for the Biden administration, which has been drawing down the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve since the spring in an effort to keep prices contained.   Although gasoline prices have fallen from recent peaks, they are still higher than they were throughout the past several years. Along with elevated oil and natural gas prices, this has powered a series of record-breaking quarterly profits at energy companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The net income of global oil and gas producers is set to double this year, to an ''unprecedented'' $4 trillion, the International Energy Agency said in a recent report.   President Biden has criticized energy companies for ''profiteering'' and threatened them with a new windfall profits tax, a policy already in place in some other parts of the world, unless they increased production. His administration has been highlighting the price declines on social media.   Falling gasoline prices may be welcome news for the Federal Reserve, too, as it tries to curb inflation by raising interest rates and slowing down the economy. Still, the economic implications could be complicated. As consumers spend less on gasoline, they have more cash for other purchases.   ''It's good for households and it's good for affordability,'' said Beth Ann Bovino, the U.S. chief economist at the financial analysis firm S&P Global. ''But at the same time the easing up of pricing pressure at the gas pump leaves more money to spend elsewhere, that might give a near-term boost to inflation, which the Fed would have to fight.''   The gasoline price trend has not been matched by diesel, a fuel essential to industry, agriculture and transporting goods. U.S. diesel prices have fallen in recent weeks, but are roughly 40 percent higher than a year ago, partly because of disruptions to Europe's supplies.   While the decline in gasoline prices has been widely felt, some states still have prices well above the national average. In California, which has high gasoline taxes and rigorous emissions standards that increase the cost of refining, the average price of regular gasoline was $4.62 a gallon on Thursday, down from $6.44 in June. In several Southern and Midwestern states, however, prices are below $3 a gallon, mainly because they have minimal gasoline taxes, if any, and demand is lower in rural areas, according to Devin Gladden, an AAA spokesman.   Global oil prices account for more than half the cost of gasoline. The prices of both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude, the global benchmark, have fallen more than 20 percent since late August, as Covid-19 lockdowns in China reduced demand.   AAA expects gasoline prices to continue to decline through the end of the month, Mr. Gladden said, partly because winter-blend gasoline has fewer environmental restrictions, making it cheaper to produce.   But U.S. gasoline prices frequently decline in December before rising in January. And factors beyond the United States -- including the Ukraine war and the decelerating world economy -- make the outlook for the new year uncertain.   ''We just have to continue watching oil prices because they remain volatile and as we saw in the spring, if oil prices spike to $100 per barrel, gas prices will follow suit,'' he said. ''A lot will depend on how the geopolitical tension continues to unfold throughout the winter.''   A further easing of China's pandemic restrictions, for example, could prompt a rise in demand that would drive up oil prices. On Wednesday, the Chinese government loosened some of its rules after protests against its ''zero Covid'' policy.    A drop in oil supplies could also push prices up. OPEC and its allies, including Russia, trimmed production in October, and affirmed these targets at a meeting on Sunday. An embargo on Russian oil imports by the European Union also took effect this week, as did an elaborate plan to cap the price of Russian oil, led by the Group of 7 industrial nations.   ''We think the market may be underestimating Russia's resolve to reduce output and exports in response to the E.U. embargo and the price cap,'' said Tatiana Orlova, the lead economist at Oxford Economics, noting that oil prices were likely to rise in the coming weeks if Russian exports were to fall.   ''The stage is set for a spike in oil prices,'' said Bryan Benoit, the U.S. national managing partner of energy at the accounting firm Grant Thornton.

"99","The Digest","December 14, 2022 Wednesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2",521,"Reuters and The Associated Press",NA,"ECONOMY Bank of England Sees'Significant Pressure' in '23    The Bank of England warned on Tuesday about ''significant pressure'' on households and businesses because of higher inflation and borrowing costs, but said they were more resilient than before the global financial crisis.   The bank had previously said Britain was entering a lengthy recession and, with inflation at a 41-year high and a sharp rise in interest rates over the last year, government forecasters have predicted a record squeeze on living standards.   ''Falling real incomes, increases in mortgage costs and higher unemployment will place significant pressure on household finances,'' the bank said in its half-yearly Financial Stability Report.   Around 4 million households are likely to face higher mortgage payments in 2023, with the average monthly mortgage payment rising to about 17 percent of pretax income. But 2.4 percent of households would find themselves with mortgage payments that they would find hard to afford, the report said. REUTERS   AUTOMOBILES   Subaru Recalls S.U.V.sAnd Warns of Fire Risk   Subaru on Tuesday said it was recalling 271,000 Ascent sport utility vehicles with model years from 2019 to 2022 because of increased fire risks and urged owners to park their vehicles outside until repairs are completed.   The Japanese automaker said owners should park away from structures and avoid leaving vehicles unattended while the engine is running. Subaru said a wiring connection may have a production-related defect that can cause a fire while the heater is in operation because excessive heat could melt the ground terminal and surrounding components.   There have been two fires but no injuries or crashes have been reported. Subaru dealers will replace heater ground bolts and, if needed replace the ground wire and the connector holder.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said until the recall is completed, owners should park vehicles outdoors. If an owner notices or smells smoke coming from the dash or driver's footwell area, they should immediately stop the vehicle and turn the ignition off. REUTERS   ENERGY   No Deal on Gas CapFrom E.U. Ministers   European Union energy ministers failed yet again to overcome their deep differences Tuesday on a natural gas price cap that many hope would make utility bills cheaper so people can stay a little warmer during harsh winter days -- if not this year, then later.   The ministers emerged from their fifth emergency meeting empty-handed because they cannot come to agreement on a maximum ceiling to pay for gas because of fear that global suppliers will simply bypass Europe when others offer more money.   ''There was lots of progress but no final breakthrough yet,'' said the German minister Robert Habeck.   The 27 nations have stuck together through eight rounds of sanctions against Russia over the war in Ukraine and energy-saving measures to avoid shortages of the fuel used to generate electricity, heat homes and power factories. The price cap was promised in October as a way to reduce energy bills that have soared because of Russia's invasion.

"100","Putin Bans Oil Exports To Any Country Backing West's Punitive Price Cap","December 28, 2022 Wednesday","Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 5",387,"Carly Olson",NA,"The European Union, the region that is most dependent on Russian oil, has already banned most Russian oil imports, so the cap mainly affects buyers outside of Europe. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia announced on Tuesday that his government would ban Russian oil exports to any countries that agreed to the Western price cap put in place earlier this month.    The announcement came in the form of a decree, signed by Mr. Putin and released by the Kremlin, saying that, starting on Feb. 1 and lasting for five months, no Russian oil would be sent to countries that honor the price cap.   ''Deliveries of Russian oil and oil products to foreign entities and individuals are banned, on the condition that in the contracts for these supplies, the use of a maximum price fixing mechanism is directly or indirectly envisaged,'' the decree says, according to news agencies' translations.   The impact of the move was like to be limited. The European Union, the region that is most dependent on Russian oil, has already banned most Russian oil imports, so the cap mainly affects buyers outside of Europe.   After months of negotiations, the Group of 7 wealthy democratic nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- and the European Union agreed at the beginning of December to cap the price of Russian crude oil at $60 per barrel. The move was aimed at weakening the Kremlin's revenues and diminishing its financing for the war in Ukraine, without completely disrupting global supply at a time of soaring inflation.   However, the cap is set close to Russia's existing selling price, and some countries -- like Ukraine's neighbor Poland -- argued that it did not make much of a difference to the Kremlin. The cap is to be reviewed every two months.   The Kremlin's defiant response to the cap on Tuesday was somewhat anticipated, as Moscow had already insisted that it would not sell oil subject to a price limit.   Earlier this month, a Russian deputy prime minister, Alexander Novak, said that Russia was ''working on mechanisms'' to undermine enforcement of the cap, without elaborating.   ''We will sell oil and oil products only to countries that will work with us on market conditions, even if we would have to lower production,'' Mr. Novak said on Rossiya-24, a Russian state news network. https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/27/world/russia-ukraine-news/putin-bans-oil-exports-to-nations-that-agreed-to-a-western-price-cap  Graphic"
